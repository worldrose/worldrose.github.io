# Book 1. The Rose of the World and Its Place in History.

## Chapter 1. The Rose of the World and Its Immediate Tasks.

This book began at a time when an unprecedented disaster loomed over humanity, when a generation barely recovering from the shock of the Second World War was horrified to see a strange gloom gathering on the horizon, a harbinger of an even more menacing catastrophe, an even more devastating war. I began this book during the darkest years of tyranny that ruled over two hundred million people. I started it in a prison known as a political isolator, writing it in secret. I hid the manuscript and kind forces, both human and otherwise, kept it safe during searches. Every day, I expected the manuscript to be seized and destroyed, just as my previous work had been, which took ten years of my life and led me to political isolation.

The book "The Rose of the World" concludes several years later, when the danger of a third world war no longer looms like misty clouds on the horizon, but has spread over our heads, covering the zenith and rapidly descending from it down all sides of the sky. But maybe it will be averted? Such hope glimmers in the heart of everyone, and it would be impossible to live without such hope. Some try to reinforce it with logical arguments and active actions. Some manage to persuade themselves that the danger is exaggerated. Others try not to think about it at all, immersing themselves in the concerns of their small world and deciding once and for all: let whatever happens, happen. And there are those in whose soul the hope smolders as a dying spark, who live, move, and work only by inertia.

I am finishing the manuscript of "The Rose of the World" at liberty, in a golden autumn garden. The one under whose yoke the country had been exhausted is already reaping the fruits of what he has sown in other worlds. And yet, I hide the last pages of the manuscript just like I hid the first, and I dare not dedicate its content to any living soul, and I still have no confidence that the book will not be destroyed, that the spiritual experience with which it is saturated will be transmitted to anyone.

But perhaps it will be enough, and tyranny will never return? Perhaps humanity will forever keep the memory of Russia's terrible historical experience? Such hope is kindled in the heart of everyone, and without this hope, it would be nauseating to live.

But I belong to those who have been fatally wounded by two great disasters: world wars and solitary tyranny. Such people do not believe that the roots of wars and tyrannies have already been overcome in humanity or will be overcome in a short time. Perhaps the danger of this tyranny, this war, can be removed, but some time later the threat of the next one will arise. Both of these disasters were apocalypses for us - revelations of the power of world Evil and its eternal struggle with the forces of Light. People of other eras probably would not understand us; our anxiety would seem exaggerated to them, our worldview - painful. But such an understanding of historical regularities, which has been burned into human beings by half a century of contemplation and participation in events and processes of unprecedented scale, is not exaggerated. And that outcome, which has formed in the human soul as a result of the activity of its brightest and deepest sides, cannot be painful.

I am seriously ill, and the years of my life are counted. If the manuscript is destroyed or lost, I will not have time to restore it. But if it reaches at least a few people someday whose spiritual thirst will compel them to read it to the end, overcoming all its difficulties, the ideas laid out in it cannot help but become seeds, giving rise to shoots in other hearts.

And whether this will happen before the third world war or after it, or whether the third war will not be unleashed in the coming years at all - the book will not die anyway if at least one friendly pair of eyes passes, chapter by chapter, through its pages. Because the questions it tries to answer will still concern people in the distant future.

These questions are not exhausted by the issues of war and state structure. However, nothing shakes my conviction that the most terrifying dangers that threaten humanity now and will continue to threaten for many centuries are the great suicidal war and absolute worldwide tyranny. Perhaps in our era, humanity will surpass or at least survive the third world war, as it did in the first and second. Perhaps it will endure, somehow, a tyranny even more extensive and merciless than the one we endured. It is also possible that in a hundred or two hundred years, new dangers for peoples will arise that are no less deadly than tyranny and the great war, but different. It is possible. Probable. But no effort of reason, no imagination or intuition can depict the impending dangers that would not be in some way connected with one of the two main ones: the danger of the physical destruction of humanity due to war and the danger of its spiritual death due to absolute worldwide tyranny.

The book is aimed primarily against these two evils. Two fundamental, primary evils. It is aimed against them not as a pamphlet, not as an exposing satire, not as a sermon. The most scorching satire and the most fiery sermon are fruitless if they only lash out at evil and prove that good is good and bad is bad. They are fruitless if they are not based on knowledge of the foundations of that worldview, that universal doctrine and that effective program that, spreading from mind to mind and from will to will, would be capable of turning these two fundamental dangers away from humanity. To share my experience with others, to open up the picture of historical and meta-historical perspectives, the branching chain of dilemmas facing us or likely to arise, the panorama of different material worlds, closely interrelated with us in good and evil - that is the task of my life. I sought and seek to fulfill it in the forms of verbal art, in prose and poetry, but the peculiarities of this art did not allow me to reveal the entire concept with the necessary completeness, to present it exhaustively, clearly, and accessibly. To unfold this concept precisely in this way, to make it understood how it, interpreting the supernatural, at the same time holds the key to both the current processes of history and the fate of each of us - that is the task of this book. A book that, if the Lord preserves it from destruction, must be inserted, like one of many bricks, into the foundation of the Rose of the World, into the basis of all-human Brotherhood.

There is an institution that has claimed for centuries to be the sole unswerving unifier of people, preventing them from the danger of a war of all against all, the danger of falling into chaos. Such an institution is the state. Since the end of the clan system, the state has been an essential necessity at every historical stage. Even hierocracies, attempting to replace it with religious power, turned into varieties of the same State. The state cemented society on the basis of violence, and the level of moral development necessary to cement society on some other principle has not been achieved. Of course, it has not been achieved to this day. The state still remains the only proven means against social chaos. However, the existence of higher ethical principles in humanity, capable not only of maintaining but also improving social harmony, is becoming clear. What is even more important, paths of accelerated development of these principles are emerging.

In the political history of modern times, two polar directions can be easily distinguished. One of them aims at the further development of the state principle as such, at strengthening the comprehensive dependence of the individual on the state, more precisely, on the entity that controls the state apparatus: parties, armies, leaders. States of the fascist or national-socialist type are the brightest examples of such phenomena. The other stream of events, which emerged already in the 18th century, if not earlier, is the stream of humanistic orientation. Its origins and main stages are English parliamentarianism, the French Declaration of Human Rights, the German Social Democracy, and finally, the liberation struggle against colonialism. The ultimate goal of this stream of events is to weaken the cementing violence in the lives of peoples and transform the state from a predominantly police apparatus defending national or class domination into an apparatus of universal economic balance and protection of individual rights. There are still original formations in historical reality that may appear as hybrids. Essentially remaining phenomena of the first type, they alter their own appearance to the extent that it is appropriate to achieve the set goal. This is only tactics, masking, nothing more.

Despite the polarity of these streams of phenomena, they are united by one characteristic that is most typical of the 20th century: a striving towards the universal. The external pathos of various movements of our era is expressed in their constructive programs for national organization; but the internal driving force of modern history is a spontaneous urge towards the universal.

The most powerful movement of the first half of our century was distinguished by the internationalism of its doctrine and the planetary scale of its aspirations. The Achilles' heel of the movements that opposed it - racism and national socialism - was their narrow nationalism, or rather, the narrow racial or national borders of the blissful zones that they tempted and mesmerized. However, they too sought world domination, and with tremendous energy. Now, cosmopolitan Americanism is preoccupied with avoiding the mistakes of its predecessors.

What does this sign of the times indicate? Does it not point to the fact that universality, which used to be an abstract idea, has become a universal necessity? Does it not suggest that the world has become indivisible and cramped as never before? Does it not imply that a radical and lasting solution to all urgent problems can only be achieved on a universal scale?

Despotic regimes systematically implement the principle of extreme violence, or cleverly combine methods to veil it. The pace is accelerating. Such colossal states are emerging that would have taken centuries to construct in the past. Each, being predatory in its nature, strives to impose its own power on humanity. Their military and technological power is becoming dizzying. They have already plunged the world into the abyss of wars and tyranny so many times - what guarantees are there that they will not do it again and again? And finally, the strongest will prevail on a global scale, even if it means turning a third of the planet into a lunar landscape. Then the cycle will end, giving way to the greatest of all evils: a single dictatorship over the surviving two thirds of the world - first, perhaps, oligarchic, and then, as is usually the case in the second stage of dictatorships, autocratic. This is the most terrifying threat of all that hangs over humanity: the threat of a universal tyranny.

Consciously or unconsciously sensing this danger, movements of humanistic orientation are trying to consolidate their efforts. They babble about cultural cooperation, wave pacifist and democratic freedom slogans, seek illusory salvation in neutrality, or, frightened by the aggressiveness of the enemy, themselves take his path. None of them has put forward the indisputable goal, namely the idea that ethical control is urgently necessary over the activities of states. Some societies, traumatized by the horrors of world wars, are trying to unite in order to subsequently embrace the whole earth in a political union. But what would that lead to now? The danger of wars, true, would be eliminated, at least temporarily. But where are the guarantees that this superstate, relying on extensive morally backward layers - and there are much more of them in the world than one would like - and stirring up the not yet eradicated instincts of ambition and torment in humanity, will not turn into a dictatorship and, finally, into a tyranny that will make all previous ones look like a joke?

It is significant that it is precisely religious denominations that were the first to proclaim the international ideals of brotherhood, which now find themselves in the rearguard of the general trend towards a universal. Perhaps this is due to their characteristic concentration on the inner man, disregard for everything external, and the external also includes the problem of the social organization of humanity. But if you look deeper, if you say out loud what is usually only said in narrow circles of people living an intensive religious life, something will be revealed that not everyone takes into account. This is the mystical horror that arose in the days of the ancient Roman Empire in anticipation of the coming unification of the world, this is an insatiable anxiety for humanity, because a trap is felt in a single universal state, from where the only way out will be to absolute despotism, to the kingdom of "the prince of this world", to the last cataclysms of history and its catastrophic break.

And indeed, where are the guarantees that at the head of this super-state will not be a great ambitious person, and science will serve him faithfully and truthfully as a tool for turning this super-state into that monstrous machine of torture and spiritual mutilation that I am talking about? Can there be any doubt that even now there are prerequisites for inventing perfect control over people's behavior and their way of thinking? What are the limits of those nightmarish perspectives that arise before our imagination as a result of the intersection of two factors: terrorist dictatorship and 21st-century technology? Tyranny will be all the more absolute as then there will be no last, tragic path of liberation: the crushing of tyranny from the outside as a result of military defeat - there will be no one left to fight, everyone will be subservient. And the world unity, dreamed of by so many generations, demanding so many sacrifices, will turn into its demonic side: its hopelessness in the event that the leadership of this unity is taken by adherents of dark forces.

On bitter experience, humanity is already convinced that neither the socio-economic movements whose leadership is taken up by bare reason nor the achievements of science itself are capable of leading humanity between Scylla and Charybdis – tyrannies and world wars.

Worse yet, new socio-economic systems, when they come to power, themselves become adorned with mechanisms of political despotism, becoming the sowers and instigators of world wars. Science becomes their obedient servant, far more obedient and reliable than the church was for feudal lords. The tragedy lies in the fact that scientific activity from the very beginning was not coupled with deeply thought-out moral education. All were admitted to this activity regardless of their level of moral development. It is not surprising that every success of science and technology now turns against the true interests of humanity. The internal combustion engine, radio, aviation, atomic energy – all strike at the living flesh of peoples with one end. And the development of means of communication and technical achievements that allow the police regime to monitor the intimate life and secret thoughts of each person bring an iron base under the vampiric piles of dictatorships.

Thus, the experience of history brings humanity to the understanding of the obvious fact that dangers will be prevented and social harmony achieved not by the development of science and technology themselves, not by the overdevelopment of the state element, not by the dictatorship of the "strong man," not by the coming to power of pacifist organizations of the social-democratic type, rocked by historical winds from powerlessness and idealism to revolutionary maximalism – but by recognizing the urgent need for one and only path: the establishment of some untainted, incorruptible, highly authoritative institution over the World Federation of States, an ethical, non-state and supranational institution, because the nature of the state is unethical by its very essence.

What idea, what doctrine will help create such control? What minds will develop it and make it acceptable to the vast majority? By what means will such an institution come to universal recognition, to a height dominating even the Federation of States – rejecting violence? But if it takes as a guiding principle the gradual replacement of violence with something else, then what exactly and in what sequence? And what doctrine will be able to resolve all the emerging problems with their incredible complexity?

This passage is from a book that aims to answer certain questions, although its overall theme is wider. Before providing an answer, it is important to clearly formulate what this doctrine sees as its greatest enemy and what it is directed against.

In historical terms, it sees its enemies in any state, party, or doctrine that seeks to violently enslave others and any form of despotic governance. In a meta-historical sense, its enemy is one thing: the spirit of tyranny, the Great Tormentor, manifesting itself in various ways throughout the history of our planet. For the movement being discussed, both now, when it is barely emerging, and later, when it becomes the decisive voice of history, the enemy will be one thing: the desire for tyranny and cruel violence, wherever it arises, even within the movement itself. Violence can only be considered justifiable to the extent of extreme necessity, only in softened forms and only until the highest authority, through improved education, prepares humanity to replace coercion with voluntariness, the external voice of law with the voice of a deep conscience, and states with brotherhood. In other words, until the essence of the state is transformed, and a living brotherhood replaces the soulless apparatus of state violence.

It is not necessary to assume that such a process will necessarily take a huge amount of time. Historical experience of great dictatorships, which covered huge countries with an extraordinary energy and consistency of a carefully planned system of education and upbringing, has convincingly demonstrated the leverage of this method of influencing generations' mentality. Generations were formed closer and closer to what was desirable for the ruling authorities. Nazi Germany, for example, managed to achieve its goals even in the eyes of one generation. Of course, nothing but anger and disgust can evoke its ideals in us. Not only its ideals - even its methodology must be almost completely rejected by us. But the lever it has opened must be taken in our hands and firmly grasped. The century of the triumph of broad spiritual enlightenment and decisive achievements of a new, barely emerging pedagogy is approaching. If at least a few dozen schools were entrusted to it, a generation capable of fulfilling its duty not by coercion, but by free will, not out of fear, but out of creative impulse and love would be formed there. This is the essence of the education of a person of an ennobled type.

It seems to me that an international organization, political and cultural, aiming at transforming the essence of the state through the consistent implementation of all-encompassing reforms, should be created. The decisive step towards this goal is the creation of a World Federation of States as independent members, but with a special body established over the Federation that controls the activities of states and directs their bloodless and painless transformation from within. It is precisely bloodless and painless - that is what it is all about, that is what distinguishes it from past revolutionary doctrines.

What the structure of this organization will be, what its name will be - it seems premature and unnecessary to predict. Let us conditionally call it, so as not to repeat lengthy descriptions each time, the League for the Transformation of the Essence of the State. As for its structure, those who will become its organizers will be more experienced and practical than I am: they will be public figures, not poets. I can only say that personally, it seems to me that the League should have its branches in all countries, and each branch should have several aspects: cultural, philanthropic, educational, and political. Such a political aspect of each branch will structurally and organizationally transform into a national party of the World Religious and Cultural Reform.

I do not know how, where, and among whom the formation of the League will take place, and I cannot know. But it is clear that the period from its inception until the creation of a federation of states and an ethical institution above them should be considered a preparatory period, a period when the League will devote all its efforts to the dissemination of its ideas, the formation of its ranks, the expansion of the organization, the education of the younger generation, and the creation within itself of that future institution to which the world leadership role may eventually be entrusted.

The League's charter cannot prevent people of different philosophical and religious beliefs from joining its ranks. All that is required is a willingness to actively participate in implementing its program and a determination not to violate its moral principles, which are accepted as the cornerstone.

In all the vicissitudes of social life and political struggle, the successes of the League must be achieved not by deviating from its moral code, but precisely because of its adherence to it. Its reputation must be unblemished, its selflessness beyond doubt, and its authority growing, because the best forces of humanity will gather in it and continuously strengthen it.

Most likely, the path to global unity will lie through a ladder of various stages of international solidarity, through the union and merger of regional communities. The final step of this ladder is represented by a global referendum or plebiscite - some form of free expression of will of all. Perhaps it will lead to the victory of the League only in certain countries. But the historical course of events will be on its side. The unification of at least half of the globe will complete a profound shift in the consciousness of peoples. A second referendum will take place, maybe a third, and a decade earlier or later the boundaries of the Federation will coincide with the boundaries of humanity. Then a practical opportunity will arise to carry out a chain of broad measures aimed at transforming the conglomerate of states into a monolith, gradually transformed by two parallel processes: external - political, social, and economic, and internal - educational, ethical, and religious.

It is clear from all this that the leaders of the League and its national parties will be able to fight only with words and their own example, and only with those ideologies and doctrines that seek to clear the way for any dictatorships or support these dictatorships at the levers of power. The League will see its historical predecessors in the great Mahatma Gandhi and the party inspired by him, although they acted on a narrow national scale. The first statesman-righteous in modern history, he established a purely political movement based on high ethics and refuted the prevailing opinion that politics and morality are incompatible.

But the national boundaries within which the Indian National Congress acted will be expanded by the League to planetary boundaries, and its goals will be the next historical step or series of steps compared to those set by the great party that liberated India.

Oh, of course there will be many people who will claim that the League's methodology is impractical and unrealistic. Oh, how I despise these advocates of political realism! There is no immorality, no social repulsiveness that has not been covered by this pathetic fig leaf. There is no weight more deadly, more grounding, than talk of political realism as a counterweight to everything winged, everything inspiring, everything spiritual. Political realists, among other things, are those who once claimed, even in India itself, that Gandhi was a fantasist and a dreamer. They had to grit their teeth and bite their tongues when Gandhi and his party, precisely on the path of high ethics, achieved the country's liberation and led it further towards prosperity. Not towards external prosperity that blinds people with black dust from figures on coal production growth or radioactive ash from experimental hydrogen bomb explosions, but towards cultural, ethical, and aesthetic prosperity - spiritual prosperity that slowly but surely pulls material prosperity along with it. Those who are unable to see the best in human beings, whose psyche has become coarse and whose conscience has become dull in an atmosphere of rough state tyranny, will also accuse the League of being unrealistic in its methods. They will be joined by those who do not foresee the shifts in mass consciousness that await us in the near years. The trauma of wars, repressions, and all sorts of violence still evokes a broad movement for coexistence and peace. Events constantly occur and will occur that destroy the sense of security, leaving nothing of comfort and peace, undermining the roots of trust in existing ideologies and the order of things they protect. The exposure of unheard-of horrors perpetrated behind pompous dictatorships, the vivid realization of what their temporary victories were erected on and what they were paid for - all this parches the soul like scorching wind, and the thirst for spirituality becomes unbearable. About the removal of the threat of great wars; about the paths to uniting the world without bloodshed; about the light-bearer and righteous one who is coming to lead humanity; about the weakening of state violence and the growth of the spirit of brotherhood - this is what the faithful pray for and what the non-believers dream of in our time. And it is highly probable that the all-encompassing winged doctrine - moral, political, philosophical, and religious - will embody this generation's thirst for an all-national creative enthusiasm.

The fact that the last major religious movement in humanity, the Protestant Reformation, took place four hundred years ago, while the last global religion, Islam, has already existed for thirteen centuries, is sometimes put forward as an argument in favor of the opinion that the religious era in humanity has ended. However, the potential possibilities of religion as such, and not of its separate forms, should be judged not by how long its last major forms emerged, but by whether the evolution of religion has reached a dead end, whether it is possible to combine religious creative thought with indisputable scientific theses, and also by whether there are prospects for understanding the material of new epochs with such a worldview and whether religion can have a effective and progressive impact on this material.

Indeed, about four hundred years have passed since the last major international religious movement. But weren't there few such movements before the Protestant Reformation? And is that the point? Isn't it already clear that a certain channel of humanity's ideological and creative work in recent centuries has absorbed almost all its spiritual and intellectual forces? It would be difficult to expect that while achieving such rapid progress - scientific, technical, and social, creating such cultural values as literature, music, philosophy, art, and science in recent centuries, humanity would also find the strength to simultaneously create universal religious systems.

The turn of the 20th century marked the end of the flourishing of great literature, art, music, and philosophy. The realm of social and political action increasingly involves not the most spiritual representatives of humanity, but rather the least spiritual, and this trend is becoming more pronounced. A huge spiritual vacuum has formed that did not exist even fifty years ago, and hypertrophied science is powerless to fill it. If I may use this expression, the colossal resources of human genius are not being utilized anywhere. This is the womb of creative forces in which the predetermined birth of a universal inter-religion is maturing.

Will religion be able to prevent the most ominous dangers that threaten humanity, not in its old forms, but in the religion of the future, which the world is now pregnant with: world wars and world tyranny? It is probably unable to prevent the imminent world war; if a third war breaks out, this disaster will likely occur before even the League can emerge. But preventing all wars, the dangers of which will arise after the nucleus of the forthcoming inter-religion is formed, as well as preventing world tyranny, is its immediate goal. Can this religion achieve the greatest harmony between personal freedom and the interests of humanity, which is only imaginable at this stage of history? But this is just another aspect of its immediate goal. Will it contribute to the comprehensive development of the creative abilities inherent in humans, except for demonic abilities, which are the abilities to tyrannize, torture, and assert oneself at the expense of other living beings? Yes. Does it require bloody sacrifices for its triumph, like other world-oriented movements? No, except in cases where its preachers may have to testify to their loyalty to the idea with their own blood. Do its theses contradict the objective and universally binding theses of modern science, not the philosophical doctrine of materialism (which they, of course, contradict in all respects from A to Z)? Not in a single letter or number. Can we foresee the establishment of a regime in the era of its hegemony where dissent will be persecuted, and where it will impose its dogmas on philosophy, science, and art? On the contrary, from partial restrictions on freedom of thought at first, to unlimited freedom of thought later, that is the path it proposes. What remains of the argument that religion is incapable of answering pressing questions of the time, let alone practically resolving them?

With full right and reason, such reproach can be thrown not at religion, but unfortunately at science. It is precisely the system of views that does not look beyond the boundaries of what is circumscribed by modern scientific knowledge, neither to the right nor to the left, that is incapable of answering the most fundamental, most elementary questions. - Does the First Cause, Creator, God exist? Unknown. - Does the soul or something similar to it exist, and is it immortal? Science does not know this. - What is time, space, matter, energy? Opinions sharply diverge on this. - Is the world eternal and infinite, or, on the contrary, limited in time and space? Science does not have the material for a solid answer to these questions. - Why should I do good and not evil if I like evil and can protect myself from punishment? The answers are completely incomprehensible. - How to use science to prevent the possibility of wars and tyrannies? Silence. - How to achieve social harmony with the least number of victims? Mutually exclusive proposals are put forward, similar only in one thing: that they all are equally unrelated to strict science. Naturally, on such shaky, subjective, truly pseudo-scientific foundations, teachings of class, racial, national, and party egoism arose, that is, precisely those whose vocation is to justify dictatorships and wars. Low spirituality is a characteristic feature of such teachings. Therefore, the sought-after ethical instance can be built not on the so-called scientific worldview - which, in fact, does not exist - but on participation in the spiritual world, on the perception of rays flowing from there into the heart, mind, and conscience, and on the implementation of the covenant of active and creative love in all spheres of life. The moral level, fully corresponding to the enumerated characteristics, is called righteousness.

Another prejudice is also widespread: the view of religion as a reactionary phenomenon by its very nature, especially in our era. However, to speak of the reactionariness or obsolescence of religion in general, regardless of its specific forms, is as meaningless as proving the reactionariness of art or philosophy in general. Those who think dynamically, who see evolving series of facts and processes that shape these series, can discern reactionary and progressive forms in art, religion, and any area of human activity. Reactive forms of religion can be encountered as much as one would like, and even more than one would like, but this has no bearing on the emerging religion of the outcome to which this book is dedicated. For in our century, there have been and are no more progressive goals or methods than those united with this religion. As for claims of scientific method to some sort of superiority, the scientific method is just as powerless to supplant artistic and religious methods in the broad sense of the word, as aggressive religiosity was unable to do so in its time. Because these methods differ not only in how they do things but also in what they know. In the past century, under the influence of rapid progress in science and technology, the death of art was prophesied. A hundred years have passed, and the flowering of the arts has not only not died, but has been enriched by one more: the art of cinema. Forty or thirty years ago, the inevitable demise of religion in Russia due to scientific and social progress seemed to many. However, the flowering of religions not only did not die, despite all the means mobilized for this purpose, but it is precisely under the influence of scientific and social progress that it is enriched by what will make world religiosity a complete and unified spiritual flower - the Rose of the World.

From all that has been said, it follows that a religious movement that includes in its worldview and practice the positive experience of humanity and draws conclusions from the negative that require too much courage and integrity to be made on the paths of other trends in public thought; a movement that places transformation of the state into a brotherhood, the unification of the earth, and the education of a refined human being as its immediate goals; a movement that will protect itself from the distortion of the ideal and methodology with the unbreakable armor of high morality - such a movement cannot but be recognized as progressive, prospective, and creatively young.

Armor of morality! But on what basis can such morality be created? I spoke about righteousness. But is not righteousness the utopia of entire social circles, not individuals?

It should be clarified what is meant here by righteousness. Righteousness is not necessarily the fruit of monastic asceticism. Righteousness is the highest stage of a person's moral development; one who has surpassed it is no longer righteous but a saint. The forms of righteousness, however, are diverse; they depend on time, place, and human character. One can say in general: righteousness - in its negative aspect - is such a state of a person, stable and ending only with their death, in which their will is freed from impulses of self-love, reason - from captivity by material interests, and the heart - from the boiling of random, murky, soul-degrading emotions. In the positive aspect, righteousness is the penetration of active love for God, people, and the world into all external and internal activities of a person.

The psychological climate for the emergence of a moral authority based on righteousness is unlikely to be prepared better anywhere than in a society united in the hope of its emergence and seeing its meaning and purpose in this. But it is precisely such a society that should be the League. Among its members may even be atheists. But the League's main thesis is the necessity of a worldwide ethical authority above states, and it is this that will unite the most inspired, creative, active, and talented members into its core. A core characterized by an atmosphere of constant spiritual creativity, active love, and purity. A core consisting of people who are enlightened enough to understand not only the danger threatening each of them due to the unbridled impulses of self, but also the danger of too external a understanding of religious and moral values, which leads to ethical formalism, hypocrisy, spiritual callousness, and sanctimoniousness.

No one but the Lord God knows where and when the first flame of the Rose of the World will ignite. The country - Russia - is only indicated; tragic events that complicate the performance of this mystical act and force it to be postponed to another country are still possible. The era - the 1960s of our century - is only outlined; deadly cataclysms that will push this date far into the future are possible. Perhaps the environment where the first flame ignites will not be the League for the transformation of the essence of the state, but another, as yet unpredictable circle of people. But whether there or here, in this country or another, earlier or later by a decade, the interreligious, all-human church of the new times, the Rose of the World, will appear as the result of the spiritual activity of many, as the collective creativity of people who have become recipients of a pouring stream of revelation - it will emerge, arise, and enter onto the historical path.

Religion, inter-religion, church - I cannot achieve the necessary precision using any of these words. A number of its fundamental differences from old religions and churches will eventually compel the use of different words in reference to it. But even without that, the introduction of this book requires the use of such an extensive range of new words that it is preferable, at the very beginning, to resort not to these words, but to a descriptive definition of the distinctive features of what should be called the Rose of the World.

This is not a closed religious denomination, true or false. This is not an international religious society like Theosophical, Anthroposophical or Masonic, composed, like a bouquet, of individual colors of religious truths, eclectically gathered in all sorts of religious meadows. This is an inter-religion or pan-religion in the sense that it should be understood as a universal teaching that points to such a perspective on previously arisen religions, in which they all turn out to be reflections of different layers of spiritual reality, different series of immaterial facts, different segments of the planetary cosmos. This perspective embraces Shambhala as a whole and as part of the divine cosmos of the universe. If old religions are petals, then the Rose of the World is a flower: with roots, stem, cup, and all the community of its petals.

The second difference is the universality of the aspirations of the Rose of the World and their historical concreteness. No religion, except medieval Catholicism, ever set itself the task of transforming the social body of humanity. However, the papacy, which stubbornly sought to contain the feudal chaos with the dams of hierocracy, failed to weaken the exploitation of the poor by the rich, reduce social inequality through sweeping reforms, or increase general prosperity. However, it would be unfair to blame the leading Catholic hierarchy for this: there were no material means, neither economic nor technical, for such transformations. The evil of the world was felt from time immemorial and remained ineradicable until modern times, and Catholicism, in essence, like all other religions, addressed only the "inner man" and taught personal improvement. But times have changed, material means have appeared, and the merit of the entire historical process, rather than the Rose of the World itself, is that it can now view social transformations not as external, doomed to failure and not worthy of effort, but in an inseparable connection with the improvement of the inner world of man: now these are two parallel processes that must complement each other. One often hears, "Christianity failed." Yes, if it were all in the past, it could be said that in social and universal-moral terms it had not succeeded. "Religion failed." Yes, if religious creativity of humanity had exhausted itself with what had already been created, religion in the aforementioned sense would indeed have failed. But for now, it is only fair to say that the old religions could not achieve a significant reduction in social evil because they did not have the necessary material means, and the absence of these means provoked their negative attitude towards all such attempts. This prepared the way for the irreligious stage of civilization. In the 18th century, social consciousness awakened. Social disharmony was finally felt and recognized as something unacceptable, offensive, and requiring overcoming. Of course, this was connected with the fact that material means began to appear. But the old religions did not understand this, did not want to use these means, did not wish to lead the process of social transformation, and it is in this narrow-mindedness, intellectual laziness, and ideological immobility that their heaviest guilt lies. Religion discredited itself with centuries of helplessness in this regard, so it is not surprising that Europe and then other continents fell into the opposite extreme of transforming society purely by mechanical means while completely rejecting the spiritual side of the same process. It is no wonder, of course, that the outcome was upheavals such as the world had never seen, scales of victims that had never even been imagined, and such a lowering of the ethical level that the very possibility of which in the 20th century still seems to many a dark and tragic mystery. Old religions bear a significant responsibility for the depth and persistence of the subsequent irreligious stage, for the spiritual fate of millions of souls who, in the struggle for a just world order, opposed religion in general and thereby uprooted the roots of their existence from the womb of world spirituality. But true religious activity is a kind of public service, and true public service is at the same time religious activity. No religious act, not even the feat of a monk, can be isolated from the general work for the benefit of universal enlightenment; and no social activity, except for demonic ones, can fail to influence the increase in the sum of world good, that is, not have a religious meaning. The beating of social conscience, effective social compassion and rejoicing, incessant practical efforts to transform the social body of mankind - these are the second differences of the Rose of the World from ancient religions.

The third difference is the dynamism of its views. Religions that are not alien to meta-history, such as Judaism and early Christianity, existed, but only in distant and short periods of their development did they attempt to spiritually comprehend the current historical process. In those short, half-forgotten epochs, the striking insights of the Apocalypse remained covered from people's eyes by a veil of innuendos and insinuations; the cipher of images allowed for all sorts of interpretations. True understanding of the historical process never took place. The historical experience was still small and narrow, the geographic horizon was negligible, the mystical mind was not prepared to grasp the internal laws of meta-history and the incredible complexity of Shadanakar. But the era of the hegemony of science preceded the phenomenon of the Rose of the World, shaking up the conception of the universe, nations, cultures, and their destiny at the very root. It was also preceded by another thing: an era of radical shifts and upheavals in society, an era of revolutions and planetary wars. Both series of phenomena stirred up psychological strata that had been stagnant for so many centuries. Seeds of meta-historical revelation fall into the soil torn up by the iron teeth of historical catastrophes. And the planetary cosmos(^1) opens up to spiritual vision as an ever-changing system of worlds with multiple meanings, rushing towards a dazzling goal, becoming spiritualized and transformed from century to century, from day to day. Rows of upcoming epochs begin to shine through, each with its own unique characteristics and a combination of meta-historical elements struggling within it. The aim of the Rose of the World is to become a receiver, multiplier, and interpreter of this knowledge. As the mystical collective mind of humanity, she will comprehend the historical process in its past, present, and future in order to enter into creative leadership of it. If it is possible to speak of any dogmas in her teachings, then it is a deeply dynamic, multi-aspect, and capable of further enrichment and development, of long-term improvement.

(^1): By planetary cosmos is meant the totality of layers of various materiality, of different spatial and temporal coordinates, but invariably connected with the sphere of the Earth as a planet. The planetary cosmos is the earthly sphere in all the complexity of its material (not just physical) layers of existence. Similar powerful systems exist for many celestial bodies. They are called brahmaturas. The brahmatura of the Earth is named Shadanakar. As for these words, like many others used here for the first time or changed in meaning with new implications, it is worth looking at a small dictionary attached at the end.

From this follows another, fourth, distinction of the Rose of the World: the perspective of consecutive spiritual-historical tasks, which are quite specific and fundamentally achievable. I will list again the nearest ones: the unification of the Earth into a Federation of states with an ethical controlling body over it, the spread of material prosperity and a high cultural level to the population of all countries, the upbringing of generations in an ennobled image, the reunification of Christian churches and a free union with all religions of a bright direction, the transformation of the planet into a garden and states into brotherhood. But these are only first priority tasks. Their implementation will open the way to solving even higher tasks: the spiritualization of nature.

So, interreligiousness, the universality of social aspirations and their specificity, the dynamism of views and the sequence of world-historical tasks - these are the features that distinguish the Rose of the World from all religions and churches of the past. The bloodlessness of its paths, the painlessness of its reforms, kindness and tenderness towards people, waves of emotional warmth spreading around - these are the features that distinguish it from all political and social movements of the past and present.

It is clear that the essence of the state, as well as the ethical character of society, cannot be transformed in an instant. A complete rejection of coercion from the outset is a utopia. However, this element will diminish over time and in public space. Every discipline consists of elements of coercion and consciousness, and the proportion between these two elements determines the type of discipline. The discipline of slave economies, prisons, and concentration camps has the highest percentage of coercion and almost no consciousness. A little more consciousness is present in military drill. And as the element of coercion weakens in disciplinary systems, the categorical imperative of self-discipline will replace it. The entire new pedagogy will be based on cultivating this impulse. The principles and methods of this pedagogy, as well as the methods of re-educating and rehabilitating criminals, will be discussed in one of the last chapters. But it is already clear, it seems, that the stimulus of external coercion will rapidly diminish in the inner concentric circles of the Rose of the World. For it will be these people, who have completely fused their lives with its tasks and ethics, and who no longer need external coercion, who will fill these inner circles. It is precisely these people who will be its conscience, and who else but them should occupy the seats of the Supreme Council?

And can we overestimate the educational value of such social structures, when at the top of society there are leaders who create and act with the greatest dignity: not those whose willpower is hypertrophied at the expense of other faculties of the soul and whose strength lies in an indiscriminate attitude towards means, but those in whom harmoniously developed will, reason, love, purity of thoughts, and deep life experience are combined with obvious spiritual gifts - those whom we call righteous people. Quite recently we saw an example of this: we saw the fateful hour of India and the great soul Gandhi. We saw an amazing spectacle: a man who had no state power, under whose authority there was not a single soldier, not even a personal servant, who had no roof over his head and walked in a loincloth, became the conscience, the spiritual and political leader of three hundred million people, and one of his quiet words was enough to unite these millions in a common bloodless struggle for the liberation of their country, and the shedding of the enemy's blood led to a nationwide fast and mourning. It is easy to imagine how tragically distorted the historical path of the Indian people would have been if, instead of this activist at the decisive moment, a person of a one-sided willful type had emerged as the leader, like Mussolini or Stalin, a so-called "strong personality", a master of demagogy and political intrigue, masking his despotism with tirades about the public good! How brilliantly he would have played on the lowest instincts of the people, on their natural hatred of conquerors, on envy of the rich; what waves of fire and blood would have swept over India, flooding the islands of high ethical consciousness, which for thousands of years were strengthened and cherished by the best sons of the great nation! And what tyranny would have been erected in the end over the tortured country, using the tendency to obedience created by centuries of slavery! Gandhi directed the liberating and creative enthusiasm of the nation along a different path. Here is the first example in modern history of that force which will gradually replace the sword and the whip of state power. This force is the living trust of the people in those who have proved their moral height; this is the authority of righteousness.

I anticipate many objections. One of them is as follows: yes, this was possible in India, with its unique characteristics, four-thousand-year-old religious history, and the ethical level of its people. Other nations have different legacies, and India's experience cannot be transferred to any other country. It is true that every nation has its own legacy. And India's legacy led its people to become pioneers on this path. But almost every nation has seen dictatorships and tyrannies of various hues, diverse ideological camouflage, and each one could see the abyss into which blind power, unenlightened righteousness, and not even meeting the demands of the average moral level, were leading the country. And yet, state leadership is a feat, and the average moral level is too small for that. Many peoples have seen this too because where instead of dictators, political parties alternate, there diplomats and generals, bosses and lawyers, demagogues and businessmen change, some are more selfish, others more ideological, but none can breathe new, pure, and fervent spirit into life, or solve urgent national problems. Nobody can trust any of them more than themselves because none of them even thought about what righteousness and spirituality is. These are wandering shadows, fallen leaves caught by the winds of history. If the Rose of the World does not come onto the world stage in time, they will be scattered by the fiery breath of willful and ruthless dictatorships. But if the Rose of the World appears, they will dissolve, melt under the rising sun of the great idea because people's hearts trust one righteous person more than a hundred contemporary politicians. But even more powerful and brighter will be the impact on the people and their destiny if the three highest gifts - righteousness, the gift of religious preaching, and artistic genius - are combined in one person.

Many, oh so many manifestations of religion relate entirely to its past stages. One such manifestation, apparently, is the power over the minds of strictly defined, apodictic, undeveloped, statuary dogmas. The experience of the last centuries and the growth of personality have led to the fact that man feels the conditionality and narrowness of any dogmatism. Therefore, no matter how un-dogmatic the theses of the Rose of the World may be, no matter how permeated with the spirit of religious dynamics they are, many will still struggle to accept them. But many, many will respond to its call, as long as it is addressed not so much to the intellect as to the heart, sounding in the genius creations of words, music, theater, architecture. Artistic images are more vivid and multi-aspectual than the aphorisms of theosophy or philosophical reasoning. They leave more freedom to the imagination, they allow each person to interpret the doctrine in a way that is more organic and understandable for their individuality. Revelation flows along many channels, and art - if not the purest, then the broadest of them. Therefore, all kinds of art and the beautiful cult will dress the Rose of the World in sounding and shining covers. And that is why the most natural leader of the Rose of the World is the one who has combined three greatest gifts: the gift of religious preaching, the gift of righteousness, and the gift of artistic genius. Perhaps such a person will not come or will not come soon. Perhaps the Rose of the World will be led not by him, but by a collective of the most worthy. But if Providence directed such a great soul to our century - and It already has - and the demonic forces could not eliminate it, it would be the greatest happiness for the whole earth. Because no one can have a more powerful and luminous influence on humanity than the influence of a genius word artist who has become a spiritual leader and righteous person and has been raised to the heights of world leadership by social and cultural achievements. It is only such a person who can be entrusted with the extraordinary and unprecedented task in history: ethical control over all the states of the Federation and the leadership of the peoples on the path of transforming these states into a universal brotherhood.

Oh, we Russians have paid a heavy price for our unconditional trust in a strong person, who many of us have taken for a benefactor of humanity. Let us not repeat this mistake! There are unmistakable signs that distinguish a person worthy of such a mission from an evil genius of the nation. The latter is gloomy, while the former is joyful in spiritual merriment. One strengthens their power through executions and punishments, while the other will never seek power in their lifetime and, when they do assume it, will not spill anyone's blood. One propagates the cult of their personality, which is under their control, throughout the land; the other finds it repulsive and comical. One is inaccessible, the other is open to all. One is consumed by an insatiable thirst for life and power, and hides behind impenetrable walls of imaginary danger; the other is free from the temptations of life, and in the face of danger, they are calm because their conscience is pure and their faith unshakable. These are two antipodes, messengers of two irreconcilable principles.

Of course, in the Supreme Council, such a chosen one would only be the first among equals. They would rely on the cooperation of the multitude in everything, and their own activity would be controllable by this multitude. They could only come to this extraordinary position through a strict selection process. Such a position cannot be held by youth or even middle age, only by old age. Temptations and struggles of passions must have long been overcome. As for the election itself, it seems to me that it could only be carried out through some form of plebiscite. Moreover, during the years of the supreme mentor's rule, the Council would monitor their actions. Deviation from the path would lead to the transfer of power to a more worthy individual. In general, all issues related to this could be carefully thought out, dangers foreseen, decisions weighed carefully, and subsequently improved. But as long as the supreme mentor follows the predetermined path, they are a mystical connection between living humanity and the world above, a manifestation of the Providential will, an improver of billions, and a defender of souls. In the hands of such a person, it is not scary to combine the fullness of spiritual and civic power.

Some may say that such people appear once every five hundred years. But I will say more: personalities of this caliber, possessing a sum of these particular qualities, could not have existed in the past. Einstein could not have appeared among the Maori people of the 19th century; Dostoevsky, as we know him, would have been futile to hope to find among the subjects of Tutankhamun or Theodoric. Then he would have had a different set of qualities, and many of them would not have had the opportunity to manifest in life. Such a person, of whom I speak, even in the most prosperous era, could not have realized the gifts bestowed upon him, and contemporaries would have remained completely ignorant of his true scale and potential. The necessary conditions, apparently, are already emerging in the current era; Rose of the World will create them so that the social and cultural atmosphere ensures the chain of successors worthy of this crown to the supreme mentor.

It may also be said that even all these gifts are not enough for such extraordinary activity; one must possess a broad, sober, and practical state mind. Yes, of course. Such a performer will have to deal with thousands of diverse problems; knowledge, experience, and erudition - economic, financial, legal, and even technical - will be required. But the age of Aristotle has long passed; minds of encyclopedic coverage are unimaginable in our time. And the activity of the person I am talking about is as unthinkable in isolation from the collective mind, from the Supreme Council. The deepest minds, people seasoned in the vicissitudes of state life, specialists in all branches of knowledge will participate in it. Not encyclopedic erudition or practical economic sense will be required of the supreme mentor, but wisdom. Wisdom that understands people at first sight, that immediately finds their essence in the most complex questions, and that never turns a deaf ear to the voice of conscience. The supreme mentor must stand at such a moral height that love and trust in him would replace other methods of governance. Coercion, violence against another's will, are painful for him; he uses them only in the rarest cases.

And yet this is only one of the possible options, although, in my personal opinion, the most desirable one. It is quite possible to have a leadership of the Rose of the World, such a relationship with legislative institutions and with the government of the Federation, in which the principle of collectivity will not be limited by anything or anyone. The time to develop the constitution of the future is in the distant future, and it will be up to our happy descendants, not us, to choose one of many options. But is it not a theocracy? - I do not like the word "theocracy". Theocracy means the rule of God; to apply it to any social and state structure is absurd from the point of view of an atheist, sacrilegious from the point of view of a believer. History knows no theocracy and cannot know it. It is theocracy by the priesthood, the power of the clergy, that should be called a papal or dalai-lama church-state. And the structure I am talking about is directly opposite to any theocracy: not only does the church dissolve in the state, which has absorbed it and is dominant in its name, but also the whole conglomerate of states, and the assembly of churches gradually dissolve into the all-human brotherhood, into the inter-religious church. And it is not the highest hierarchs of the church who occupy seats in the highest bodies, legislative, executive, and controlling, but the best representatives of all peoples, all faiths, all social strata, all professions. It is not theocracy, not monarchy, not oligarchy, not republic: something new, qualitatively different from everything that has existed before. This is a world order, striving for the sanctification and enlightenment of the entire life of the world. I do not know what it will be called then, but the name is not important, the essence is. And the essence of it is the work for the sake of spiritualization of man, spiritualization of humanity, spiritualization of nature.

## Chapter 2. Attitude towards culture.

Gradually, a new attitude is emerging towards everything: the existence of the Rose of the World would have no meaning if it only repeated what was said before. A new attitude towards oneself, a new understanding is literally evoked by all phenomena, from the great to the small: the cosmic process and the historical process, the world laws and the connection between different material worlds, human relationships and the paths of personality development, states and religions, the animal kingdom and the elements - in short, everything that we unite under the concept of "culture" and everything that we unite under the concept of "nature". A new attitude is emerging towards everything, but this does not mean that every old attitude is devalued or disgraced: in many cases, only such a point of view is indicated, under which different past attitudes can cease to contrast with each other, begin to complement each other and must be read as different series of aspects of one and the same or many realities. This is often applied, for example, when considering old religions and the realities behind them.

In essence, the entire book is devoted to this new attitude towards things: such a problematic is too extensive and complex to be even briefly outlined in one chapter. This chapter, "Attitude towards culture", and the next, "Attitude towards religions", are not expected to provide a detailed presentation of these topics. The new understanding of different cultural areas, different historical phenomena, different religious systems, as well as different realms of nature, saturates all twelve books of this work. The first chapters are equivalent only to an introduction. They contain a summary presentation of some basic principles, and nothing more.
