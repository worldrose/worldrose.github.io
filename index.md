## Book I. The Rose of the World and Its Place in History

### Chapter 1. The Rose of the World and Its Immediate Tasks

This book began at a time when an unprecedented disaster loomed over humanity, when a generation barely recovering from the shock of the Second World War was horrified to see a strange gloom gathering on the horizon, a harbinger of an even more menacing catastrophe, an even more devastating war. I began this book during the darkest years of tyranny that ruled over two hundred million people. I started it in a prison known as a political isolator, writing it in secret. I hid the manuscript and kind forces, both human and otherwise, kept it safe during searches. Every day, I expected the manuscript to be seized and destroyed, just as my previous work had been, which took ten years of my life and led me to political isolation.

The book "The Rose of the World" concludes several years later, when the danger of a third world war no longer looms like misty clouds on the horizon, but has spread over our heads, covering the zenith and rapidly descending from it down all sides of the sky. But maybe it will be averted? Such hope glimmers in the heart of everyone, and it would be impossible to live without such hope. Some try to reinforce it with logical arguments and active actions. Some manage to persuade themselves that the danger is exaggerated. Others try not to think about it at all, immersing themselves in the concerns of their small world and deciding once and for all: let whatever happens, happen. And there are those in whose soul the hope smolders as a dying spark, who live, move, and work only by inertia.

I am finishing the manuscript of "The Rose of the World" at liberty, in a golden autumn garden. The one under whose yoke the country had been exhausted is already reaping the fruits of what he has sown in other worlds. And yet, I hide the last pages of the manuscript just like I hid the first, and I dare not dedicate its content to any living soul, and I still have no confidence that the book will not be destroyed, that the spiritual experience with which it is saturated will be transmitted to anyone.

But perhaps it will be enough, and tyranny will never return? Perhaps humanity will forever keep the memory of Russia's terrible historical experience? Such hope is kindled in the heart of everyone, and without this hope, it would be nauseating to live.

But I belong to those who have been fatally wounded by two great disasters: world wars and solitary tyranny. Such people do not believe that the roots of wars and tyrannies have already been overcome in humanity or will be overcome in a short time. Perhaps the danger of this tyranny, this war, can be removed, but some time later the threat of the next one will arise. Both of these disasters were apocalypses for us - revelations of the power of world Evil and its eternal struggle with the forces of Light. People of other eras probably would not understand us; our anxiety would seem exaggerated to them, our worldview - painful. But such an understanding of historical regularities, which has been burned into human beings by half a century of contemplation and participation in events and processes of unprecedented scale, is not exaggerated. And that outcome, which has formed in the human soul as a result of the activity of its brightest and deepest sides, cannot be painful.

I am seriously ill, and the years of my life are counted. If the manuscript is destroyed or lost, I will not have time to restore it. But if it reaches at least a few people someday whose spiritual thirst will compel them to read it to the end, overcoming all its difficulties, the ideas laid out in it cannot help but become seeds, giving rise to shoots in other hearts.

And whether this will happen before the third world war or after it, or whether the third war will not be unleashed in the coming years at all - the book will not die anyway if at least one friendly pair of eyes passes, chapter by chapter, through its pages. Because the questions it tries to answer will still concern people in the distant future.

These questions are not exhausted by the issues of war and state structure. However, nothing shakes my conviction that the most terrifying dangers that threaten humanity now and will continue to threaten for many centuries are the great suicidal war and absolute worldwide tyranny. Perhaps in our era, humanity will surpass or at least survive the third world war, as it did in the first and second. Perhaps it will endure, somehow, a tyranny even more extensive and merciless than the one we endured. It is also possible that in a hundred or two hundred years, new dangers for peoples will arise that are no less deadly than tyranny and the great war, but different. It is possible. Probable. But no effort of reason, no imagination or intuition can depict the impending dangers that would not be in some way connected with one of the two main ones: the danger of the physical destruction of humanity due to war and the danger of its spiritual death due to absolute worldwide tyranny.

The book is aimed primarily against these two evils. Two fundamental, primary evils. It is aimed against them not as a pamphlet, not as an exposing satire, not as a sermon. The most scorching satire and the most fiery sermon are fruitless if they only lash out at evil and prove that good is good and bad is bad. They are fruitless if they are not based on knowledge of the foundations of that worldview, that universal doctrine and that effective program that, spreading from mind to mind and from will to will, would be capable of turning these two fundamental dangers away from humanity. To share my experience with others, to open up the picture of historical and meta-historical perspectives, the branching chain of dilemmas facing us or likely to arise, the panorama of different material worlds, closely interrelated with us in good and evil - that is the task of my life. I sought and seek to fulfill it in the forms of verbal art, in prose and poetry, but the peculiarities of this art did not allow me to reveal the entire concept with the necessary completeness, to present it exhaustively, clearly, and accessibly. To unfold this concept precisely in this way, to make it understood how it, interpreting the supernatural, at the same time holds the key to both the current processes of history and the fate of each of us - that is the task of this book. A book that, if the Lord preserves it from destruction, must be inserted, like one of many bricks, into the foundation of the Rose of the World, into the basis of all-human Brotherhood.

There is an institution that has claimed for centuries to be the sole unswerving unifier of people, preventing them from the danger of a war of all against all, the danger of falling into chaos. Such an institution is the state. Since the end of the clan system, the state has been an essential necessity at every historical stage. Even hierocracies, attempting to replace it with religious power, turned into varieties of the same State. The state cemented society on the basis of violence, and the level of moral development necessary to cement society on some other principle has not been achieved. Of course, it has not been achieved to this day. The state still remains the only proven means against social chaos. However, the existence of higher ethical principles in humanity, capable not only of maintaining but also improving social harmony, is becoming clear. What is even more important, paths of accelerated development of these principles are emerging.

In the political history of modern times, two polar directions can be easily distinguished. One of them aims at the further development of the state principle as such, at strengthening the comprehensive dependence of the individual on the state, more precisely, on the entity that controls the state apparatus: parties, armies, leaders. States of the fascist or national-socialist type are the brightest examples of such phenomena. The other stream of events, which emerged already in the 18th century, if not earlier, is the stream of humanistic orientation. Its origins and main stages are English parliamentarianism, the French Declaration of Human Rights, the German Social Democracy, and finally, the liberation struggle against colonialism. The ultimate goal of this stream of events is to weaken the cementing violence in the lives of peoples and transform the state from a predominantly police apparatus defending national or class domination into an apparatus of universal economic balance and protection of individual rights. There are still original formations in historical reality that may appear as hybrids. Essentially remaining phenomena of the first type, they alter their own appearance to the extent that it is appropriate to achieve the set goal. This is only tactics, masking, nothing more.

Despite the polarity of these streams of phenomena, they are united by one characteristic that is most typical of the 20th century: a striving towards the universal. The external pathos of various movements of our era is expressed in their constructive programs for national organization; but the internal driving force of modern history is a spontaneous urge towards the universal.

The most powerful movement of the first half of our century was distinguished by the internationalism of its doctrine and the planetary scale of its aspirations. The Achilles' heel of the movements that opposed it - racism and national socialism - was their narrow nationalism, or rather, the narrow racial or national borders of the blissful zones that they tempted and mesmerized. However, they too sought world domination, and with tremendous energy. Now, cosmopolitan Americanism is preoccupied with avoiding the mistakes of its predecessors.

What does this sign of the times indicate? Does it not point to the fact that universality, which used to be an abstract idea, has become a universal necessity? Does it not suggest that the world has become indivisible and cramped as never before? Does it not imply that a radical and lasting solution to all urgent problems can only be achieved on a universal scale?

Despotic regimes systematically implement the principle of extreme violence, or cleverly combine methods to veil it. The pace is accelerating. Such colossal states are emerging that would have taken centuries to construct in the past. Each, being predatory in its nature, strives to impose its own power on humanity. Their military and technological power is becoming dizzying. They have already plunged the world into the abyss of wars and tyranny so many times - what guarantees are there that they will not do it again and again? And finally, the strongest will prevail on a global scale, even if it means turning a third of the planet into a lunar landscape. Then the cycle will end, giving way to the greatest of all evils: a single dictatorship over the surviving two thirds of the world - first, perhaps, oligarchic, and then, as is usually the case in the second stage of dictatorships, autocratic. This is the most terrifying threat of all that hangs over humanity: the threat of a universal tyranny.

Consciously or unconsciously sensing this danger, movements of humanistic orientation are trying to consolidate their efforts. They babble about cultural cooperation, wave pacifist and democratic freedom slogans, seek illusory salvation in neutrality, or, frightened by the aggressiveness of the enemy, themselves take his path. None of them has put forward the indisputable goal, namely the idea that ethical control is urgently necessary over the activities of states. Some societies, traumatized by the horrors of world wars, are trying to unite in order to subsequently embrace the whole earth in a political union. But what would that lead to now? The danger of wars, true, would be eliminated, at least temporarily. But where are the guarantees that this superstate, relying on extensive morally backward layers - and there are much more of them in the world than one would like - and stirring up the not yet eradicated instincts of ambition and torment in humanity, will not turn into a dictatorship and, finally, into a tyranny that will make all previous ones look like a joke?

It is significant that it is precisely religious denominations that were the first to proclaim the international ideals of brotherhood, which now find themselves in the rearguard of the general trend towards a universal. Perhaps this is due to their characteristic concentration on the inner man, disregard for everything external, and the external also includes the problem of the social organization of humanity. But if you look deeper, if you say out loud what is usually only said in narrow circles of people living an intensive religious life, something will be revealed that not everyone takes into account. This is the mystical horror that arose in the days of the ancient Roman Empire in anticipation of the coming unification of the world, this is an insatiable anxiety for humanity, because a trap is felt in a single universal state, from where the only way out will be to absolute despotism, to the kingdom of "the prince of this world", to the last cataclysms of history and its catastrophic break.

And indeed, where are the guarantees that at the head of this super-state will not be a great ambitious person, and science will serve him faithfully and truthfully as a tool for turning this super-state into that monstrous machine of torture and spiritual mutilation that I am talking about? Can there be any doubt that even now there are prerequisites for inventing perfect control over people's behavior and their way of thinking? What are the limits of those nightmarish perspectives that arise before our imagination as a result of the intersection of two factors: terrorist dictatorship and 21st-century technology? Tyranny will be all the more absolute as then there will be no last, tragic path of liberation: the crushing of tyranny from the outside as a result of military defeat - there will be no one left to fight, everyone will be subservient. And the world unity, dreamed of by so many generations, demanding so many sacrifices, will turn into its demonic side: its hopelessness in the event that the leadership of this unity is taken by adherents of dark forces.

On bitter experience, humanity is already convinced that neither the socio-economic movements whose leadership is taken up by bare reason nor the achievements of science itself are capable of leading humanity between Scylla and Charybdis – tyrannies and world wars.

Worse yet, new socio-economic systems, when they come to power, themselves become adorned with mechanisms of political despotism, becoming the sowers and instigators of world wars. Science becomes their obedient servant, far more obedient and reliable than the church was for feudal lords. The tragedy lies in the fact that scientific activity from the very beginning was not coupled with deeply thought-out moral education. All were admitted to this activity regardless of their level of moral development. It is not surprising that every success of science and technology now turns against the true interests of humanity. The internal combustion engine, radio, aviation, atomic energy – all strike at the living flesh of peoples with one end. And the development of means of communication and technical achievements that allow the police regime to monitor the intimate life and secret thoughts of each person bring an iron base under the vampiric piles of dictatorships.

Thus, the experience of history brings humanity to the understanding of the obvious fact that dangers will be prevented and social harmony achieved not by the development of science and technology themselves, not by the overdevelopment of the state element, not by the dictatorship of the "strong man," not by the coming to power of pacifist organizations of the social-democratic type, rocked by historical winds from powerlessness and idealism to revolutionary maximalism – but by recognizing the urgent need for one and only path: the establishment of some untainted, incorruptible, highly authoritative institution over the World Federation of States, an ethical, non-state and supranational institution, because the nature of the state is unethical by its very essence.

What idea, what doctrine will help create such control? What minds will develop it and make it acceptable to the vast majority? By what means will such an institution come to universal recognition, to a height dominating even the Federation of States – rejecting violence? But if it takes as a guiding principle the gradual replacement of violence with something else, then what exactly and in what sequence? And what doctrine will be able to resolve all the emerging problems with their incredible complexity?

This passage is from a book that aims to answer certain questions, although its overall theme is wider. Before providing an answer, it is important to clearly formulate what this doctrine sees as its greatest enemy and what it is directed against.

In historical terms, it sees its enemies in any state, party, or doctrine that seeks to violently enslave others and any form of despotic governance. In a meta-historical sense, its enemy is one thing: the spirit of tyranny, the Great Tormentor, manifesting itself in various ways throughout the history of our planet. For the movement being discussed, both now, when it is barely emerging, and later, when it becomes the decisive voice of history, the enemy will be one thing: the desire for tyranny and cruel violence, wherever it arises, even within the movement itself. Violence can only be considered justifiable to the extent of extreme necessity, only in softened forms and only until the highest authority, through improved education, prepares humanity to replace coercion with voluntariness, the external voice of law with the voice of a deep conscience, and states with brotherhood. In other words, until the essence of the state is transformed, and a living brotherhood replaces the soulless apparatus of state violence.

It is not necessary to assume that such a process will necessarily take a huge amount of time. Historical experience of great dictatorships, which covered huge countries with an extraordinary energy and consistency of a carefully planned system of education and upbringing, has convincingly demonstrated the leverage of this method of influencing generations' mentality. Generations were formed closer and closer to what was desirable for the ruling authorities. Nazi Germany, for example, managed to achieve its goals even in the eyes of one generation. Of course, nothing but anger and disgust can evoke its ideals in us. Not only its ideals - even its methodology must be almost completely rejected by us. But the lever it has opened must be taken in our hands and firmly grasped. The century of the triumph of broad spiritual enlightenment and decisive achievements of a new, barely emerging pedagogy is approaching. If at least a few dozen schools were entrusted to it, a generation capable of fulfilling its duty not by coercion, but by free will, not out of fear, but out of creative impulse and love would be formed there. This is the essence of the education of a person of an ennobled type.

It seems to me that an international organization, political and cultural, aiming at transforming the essence of the state through the consistent implementation of all-encompassing reforms, should be created. The decisive step towards this goal is the creation of a World Federation of States as independent members, but with a special body established over the Federation that controls the activities of states and directs their bloodless and painless transformation from within. It is precisely bloodless and painless - that is what it is all about, that is what distinguishes it from past revolutionary doctrines.

What the structure of this organization will be, what its name will be - it seems premature and unnecessary to predict. Let us conditionally call it, so as not to repeat lengthy descriptions each time, the League for the Transformation of the Essence of the State. As for its structure, those who will become its organizers will be more experienced and practical than I am: they will be public figures, not poets. I can only say that personally, it seems to me that the League should have its branches in all countries, and each branch should have several aspects: cultural, philanthropic, educational, and political. Such a political aspect of each branch will structurally and organizationally transform into a national party of the World Religious and Cultural Reform.

I do not know how, where, and among whom the formation of the League will take place, and I cannot know. But it is clear that the period from its inception until the creation of a federation of states and an ethical institution above them should be considered a preparatory period, a period when the League will devote all its efforts to the dissemination of its ideas, the formation of its ranks, the expansion of the organization, the education of the younger generation, and the creation within itself of that future institution to which the world leadership role may eventually be entrusted.

The League's charter cannot prevent people of different philosophical and religious beliefs from joining its ranks. All that is required is a willingness to actively participate in implementing its program and a determination not to violate its moral principles, which are accepted as the cornerstone.

In all the vicissitudes of social life and political struggle, the successes of the League must be achieved not by deviating from its moral code, but precisely because of its adherence to it. Its reputation must be unblemished, its selflessness beyond doubt, and its authority growing, because the best forces of humanity will gather in it and continuously strengthen it.

Most likely, the path to global unity will lie through a ladder of various stages of international solidarity, through the union and merger of regional communities. The final step of this ladder is represented by a global referendum or plebiscite - some form of free expression of will of all. Perhaps it will lead to the victory of the League only in certain countries. But the historical course of events will be on its side. The unification of at least half of the globe will complete a profound shift in the consciousness of peoples. A second referendum will take place, maybe a third, and a decade earlier or later the boundaries of the Federation will coincide with the boundaries of humanity. Then a practical opportunity will arise to carry out a chain of broad measures aimed at transforming the conglomerate of states into a monolith, gradually transformed by two parallel processes: external - political, social, and economic, and internal - educational, ethical, and religious.

It is clear from all this that the leaders of the League and its national parties will be able to fight only with words and their own example, and only with those ideologies and doctrines that seek to clear the way for any dictatorships or support these dictatorships at the levers of power. The League will see its historical predecessors in the great Mahatma Gandhi and the party inspired by him, although they acted on a narrow national scale. The first statesman-righteous in modern history, he established a purely political movement based on high ethics and refuted the prevailing opinion that politics and morality are incompatible.

But the national boundaries within which the Indian National Congress acted will be expanded by the League to planetary boundaries, and its goals will be the next historical step or series of steps compared to those set by the great party that liberated India.

Oh, of course there will be many people who will claim that the League's methodology is impractical and unrealistic. Oh, how I despise these advocates of political realism! There is no immorality, no social repulsiveness that has not been covered by this pathetic fig leaf. There is no weight more deadly, more grounding, than talk of political realism as a counterweight to everything winged, everything inspiring, everything spiritual. Political realists, among other things, are those who once claimed, even in India itself, that Gandhi was a fantasist and a dreamer. They had to grit their teeth and bite their tongues when Gandhi and his party, precisely on the path of high ethics, achieved the country's liberation and led it further towards prosperity. Not towards external prosperity that blinds people with black dust from figures on coal production growth or radioactive ash from experimental hydrogen bomb explosions, but towards cultural, ethical, and aesthetic prosperity - spiritual prosperity that slowly but surely pulls material prosperity along with it. Those who are unable to see the best in human beings, whose psyche has become coarse and whose conscience has become dull in an atmosphere of rough state tyranny, will also accuse the League of being unrealistic in its methods. They will be joined by those who do not foresee the shifts in mass consciousness that await us in the near years. The trauma of wars, repressions, and all sorts of violence still evokes a broad movement for coexistence and peace. Events constantly occur and will occur that destroy the sense of security, leaving nothing of comfort and peace, undermining the roots of trust in existing ideologies and the order of things they protect. The exposure of unheard-of horrors perpetrated behind pompous dictatorships, the vivid realization of what their temporary victories were erected on and what they were paid for - all this parches the soul like scorching wind, and the thirst for spirituality becomes unbearable. About the removal of the threat of great wars; about the paths to uniting the world without bloodshed; about the light-bearer and righteous one who is coming to lead humanity; about the weakening of state violence and the growth of the spirit of brotherhood - this is what the faithful pray for and what the non-believers dream of in our time. And it is highly probable that the all-encompassing winged doctrine - moral, political, philosophical, and religious - will embody this generation's thirst for an all-national creative enthusiasm.

The fact that the last major religious movement in humanity, the Protestant Reformation, took place four hundred years ago, while the last global religion, Islam, has already existed for thirteen centuries, is sometimes put forward as an argument in favor of the opinion that the religious era in humanity has ended. However, the potential possibilities of religion as such, and not of its separate forms, should be judged not by how long its last major forms emerged, but by whether the evolution of religion has reached a dead end, whether it is possible to combine religious creative thought with indisputable scientific theses, and also by whether there are prospects for understanding the material of new epochs with such a worldview and whether religion can have a effective and progressive impact on this material.

Indeed, about four hundred years have passed since the last major international religious movement. But weren't there few such movements before the Protestant Reformation? And is that the point? Isn't it already clear that a certain channel of humanity's ideological and creative work in recent centuries has absorbed almost all its spiritual and intellectual forces? It would be difficult to expect that while achieving such rapid progress - scientific, technical, and social, creating such cultural values as literature, music, philosophy, art, and science in recent centuries, humanity would also find the strength to simultaneously create universal religious systems.

The turn of the 20th century marked the end of the flourishing of great literature, art, music, and philosophy. The realm of social and political action increasingly involves not the most spiritual representatives of humanity, but rather the least spiritual, and this trend is becoming more pronounced. A huge spiritual vacuum has formed that did not exist even fifty years ago, and hypertrophied science is powerless to fill it. If I may use this expression, the colossal resources of human genius are not being utilized anywhere. This is the womb of creative forces in which the predetermined birth of a universal inter-religion is maturing.

Will religion be able to prevent the most ominous dangers that threaten humanity, not in its old forms, but in the religion of the future, which the world is now pregnant with: world wars and world tyranny? It is probably unable to prevent the imminent world war; if a third war breaks out, this disaster will likely occur before even the League can emerge. But preventing all wars, the dangers of which will arise after the nucleus of the forthcoming inter-religion is formed, as well as preventing world tyranny, is its immediate goal. Can this religion achieve the greatest harmony between personal freedom and the interests of humanity, which is only imaginable at this stage of history? But this is just another aspect of its immediate goal. Will it contribute to the comprehensive development of the creative abilities inherent in humans, except for demonic abilities, which are the abilities to tyrannize, torture, and assert oneself at the expense of other living beings? Yes. Does it require bloody sacrifices for its triumph, like other world-oriented movements? No, except in cases where its preachers may have to testify to their loyalty to the idea with their own blood. Do its theses contradict the objective and universally binding theses of modern science, not the philosophical doctrine of materialism (which they, of course, contradict in all respects from A to Z)? Not in a single letter or number. Can we foresee the establishment of a regime in the era of its hegemony where dissent will be persecuted, and where it will impose its dogmas on philosophy, science, and art? On the contrary, from partial restrictions on freedom of thought at first, to unlimited freedom of thought later, that is the path it proposes. What remains of the argument that religion is incapable of answering pressing questions of the time, let alone practically resolving them?

With full right and reason, such reproach can be thrown not at religion, but unfortunately at science. It is precisely the system of views that does not look beyond the boundaries of what is circumscribed by modern scientific knowledge, neither to the right nor to the left, that is incapable of answering the most fundamental, most elementary questions. - Does the First Cause, Creator, God exist? Unknown. - Does the soul or something similar to it exist, and is it immortal? Science does not know this. - What is time, space, matter, energy? Opinions sharply diverge on this. - Is the world eternal and infinite, or, on the contrary, limited in time and space? Science does not have the material for a solid answer to these questions. - Why should I do good and not evil if I like evil and can protect myself from punishment? The answers are completely incomprehensible. - How to use science to prevent the possibility of wars and tyrannies? Silence. - How to achieve social harmony with the least number of victims? Mutually exclusive proposals are put forward, similar only in one thing: that they all are equally unrelated to strict science. Naturally, on such shaky, subjective, truly pseudo-scientific foundations, teachings of class, racial, national, and party egoism arose, that is, precisely those whose vocation is to justify dictatorships and wars. Low spirituality is a characteristic feature of such teachings. Therefore, the sought-after ethical instance can be built not on the so-called scientific worldview - which, in fact, does not exist - but on participation in the spiritual world, on the perception of rays flowing from there into the heart, mind, and conscience, and on the implementation of the covenant of active and creative love in all spheres of life. The moral level, fully corresponding to the enumerated characteristics, is called righteousness.

Another prejudice is also widespread: the view of religion as a reactionary phenomenon by its very nature, especially in our era. However, to speak of the reactionariness or obsolescence of religion in general, regardless of its specific forms, is as meaningless as proving the reactionariness of art or philosophy in general. Those who think dynamically, who see evolving series of facts and processes that shape these series, can discern reactionary and progressive forms in art, religion, and any area of human activity. Reactive forms of religion can be encountered as much as one would like, and even more than one would like, but this has no bearing on the emerging religion of the outcome to which this book is dedicated. For in our century, there have been and are no more progressive goals or methods than those united with this religion. As for claims of scientific method to some sort of superiority, the scientific method is just as powerless to supplant artistic and religious methods in the broad sense of the word, as aggressive religiosity was unable to do so in its time. Because these methods differ not only in how they do things but also in what they know. In the past century, under the influence of rapid progress in science and technology, the death of art was prophesied. A hundred years have passed, and the flowering of the arts has not only not died, but has been enriched by one more: the art of cinema. Forty or thirty years ago, the inevitable demise of religion in Russia due to scientific and social progress seemed to many. However, the flowering of religions not only did not die, despite all the means mobilized for this purpose, but it is precisely under the influence of scientific and social progress that it is enriched by what will make world religiosity a complete and unified spiritual flower - the Rose of the World.

From all that has been said, it follows that a religious movement that includes in its worldview and practice the positive experience of humanity and draws conclusions from the negative that require too much courage and integrity to be made on the paths of other trends in public thought; a movement that places transformation of the state into a brotherhood, the unification of the earth, and the education of a refined human being as its immediate goals; a movement that will protect itself from the distortion of the ideal and methodology with the unbreakable armor of high morality - such a movement cannot but be recognized as progressive, prospective, and creatively young.

Armor of morality! But on what basis can such morality be created? I spoke about righteousness. But is not righteousness the utopia of entire social circles, not individuals?

It should be clarified what is meant here by righteousness. Righteousness is not necessarily the fruit of monastic asceticism. Righteousness is the highest stage of a person's moral development; one who has surpassed it is no longer righteous but a saint. The forms of righteousness, however, are diverse; they depend on time, place, and human character. One can say in general: righteousness - in its negative aspect - is such a state of a person, stable and ending only with their death, in which their will is freed from impulses of self-love, reason - from captivity by material interests, and the heart - from the boiling of random, murky, soul-degrading emotions. In the positive aspect, righteousness is the penetration of active love for God, people, and the world into all external and internal activities of a person.

The psychological climate for the emergence of a moral authority based on righteousness is unlikely to be prepared better anywhere than in a society united in the hope of its emergence and seeing its meaning and purpose in this. But it is precisely such a society that should be the League. Among its members may even be atheists. But the League's main thesis is the necessity of a worldwide ethical authority above states, and it is this that will unite the most inspired, creative, active, and talented members into its core. A core characterized by an atmosphere of constant spiritual creativity, active love, and purity. A core consisting of people who are enlightened enough to understand not only the danger threatening each of them due to the unbridled impulses of self, but also the danger of too external a understanding of religious and moral values, which leads to ethical formalism, hypocrisy, spiritual callousness, and sanctimoniousness.

No one but the Lord God knows where and when the first flame of the Rose of the World will ignite. The country - Russia - is only indicated; tragic events that complicate the performance of this mystical act and force it to be postponed to another country are still possible. The era - the 1960s of our century - is only outlined; deadly cataclysms that will push this date far into the future are possible. Perhaps the environment where the first flame ignites will not be the League for the transformation of the essence of the state, but another, as yet unpredictable circle of people. But whether there or here, in this country or another, earlier or later by a decade, the interreligious, all-human church of the new times, the Rose of the World, will appear as the result of the spiritual activity of many, as the collective creativity of people who have become recipients of a pouring stream of revelation - it will emerge, arise, and enter onto the historical path.

Religion, inter-religion, church - I cannot achieve the necessary precision using any of these words. A number of its fundamental differences from old religions and churches will eventually compel the use of different words in reference to it. But even without that, the introduction of this book requires the use of such an extensive range of new words that it is preferable, at the very beginning, to resort not to these words, but to a descriptive definition of the distinctive features of what should be called the Rose of the World.

This is not a closed religious denomination, true or false. This is not an international religious society like Theosophical, Anthroposophical or Masonic, composed, like a bouquet, of individual colors of religious truths, eclectically gathered in all sorts of religious meadows. This is an inter-religion or pan-religion in the sense that it should be understood as a universal teaching that points to such a perspective on previously arisen religions, in which they all turn out to be reflections of different layers of spiritual reality, different series of immaterial facts, different segments of the planetary cosmos. This perspective embraces Shambhala as a whole and as part of the divine cosmos of the universe. If old religions are petals, then the Rose of the World is a flower: with roots, stem, cup, and all the community of its petals.

The second difference is the universality of the aspirations of the Rose of the World and their historical concreteness. No religion, except medieval Catholicism, ever set itself the task of transforming the social body of humanity. However, the papacy, which stubbornly sought to contain the feudal chaos with the dams of hierocracy, failed to weaken the exploitation of the poor by the rich, reduce social inequality through sweeping reforms, or increase general prosperity. However, it would be unfair to blame the leading Catholic hierarchy for this: there were no material means, neither economic nor technical, for such transformations. The evil of the world was felt from time immemorial and remained ineradicable until modern times, and Catholicism, in essence, like all other religions, addressed only the "inner man" and taught personal improvement. But times have changed, material means have appeared, and the merit of the entire historical process, rather than the Rose of the World itself, is that it can now view social transformations not as external, doomed to failure and not worthy of effort, but in an inseparable connection with the improvement of the inner world of man: now these are two parallel processes that must complement each other. One often hears, "Christianity failed." Yes, if it were all in the past, it could be said that in social and universal-moral terms it had not succeeded. "Religion failed." Yes, if religious creativity of humanity had exhausted itself with what had already been created, religion in the aforementioned sense would indeed have failed. But for now, it is only fair to say that the old religions could not achieve a significant reduction in social evil because they did not have the necessary material means, and the absence of these means provoked their negative attitude towards all such attempts. This prepared the way for the irreligious stage of civilization. In the 18th century, social consciousness awakened. Social disharmony was finally felt and recognized as something unacceptable, offensive, and requiring overcoming. Of course, this was connected with the fact that material means began to appear. But the old religions did not understand this, did not want to use these means, did not wish to lead the process of social transformation, and it is in this narrow-mindedness, intellectual laziness, and ideological immobility that their heaviest guilt lies. Religion discredited itself with centuries of helplessness in this regard, so it is not surprising that Europe and then other continents fell into the opposite extreme of transforming society purely by mechanical means while completely rejecting the spiritual side of the same process. It is no wonder, of course, that the outcome was upheavals such as the world had never seen, scales of victims that had never even been imagined, and such a lowering of the ethical level that the very possibility of which in the 20th century still seems to many a dark and tragic mystery. Old religions bear a significant responsibility for the depth and persistence of the subsequent irreligious stage, for the spiritual fate of millions of souls who, in the struggle for a just world order, opposed religion in general and thereby uprooted the roots of their existence from the womb of world spirituality. But true religious activity is a kind of public service, and true public service is at the same time religious activity. No religious act, not even the feat of a monk, can be isolated from the general work for the benefit of universal enlightenment; and no social activity, except for demonic ones, can fail to influence the increase in the sum of world good, that is, not have a religious meaning. The beating of social conscience, effective social compassion and rejoicing, incessant practical efforts to transform the social body of mankind - these are the second differences of the Rose of the World from ancient religions.

The third difference is the dynamism of its views. Religions that are not alien to meta-history, such as Judaism and early Christianity, existed, but only in distant and short periods of their development did they attempt to spiritually comprehend the current historical process. In those short, half-forgotten epochs, the striking insights of the Apocalypse remained covered from people's eyes by a veil of innuendos and insinuations; the cipher of images allowed for all sorts of interpretations. True understanding of the historical process never took place. The historical experience was still small and narrow, the geographic horizon was negligible, the mystical mind was not prepared to grasp the internal laws of meta-history and the incredible complexity of Shadanakar. But the era of the hegemony of science preceded the phenomenon of the Rose of the World, shaking up the conception of the universe, nations, cultures, and their destiny at the very root. It was also preceded by another thing: an era of radical shifts and upheavals in society, an era of revolutions and planetary wars. Both series of phenomena stirred up psychological strata that had been stagnant for so many centuries. Seeds of meta-historical revelation fall into the soil torn up by the iron teeth of historical catastrophes. And the planetary cosmos^^1 opens up to spiritual vision as an ever-changing system of worlds with multiple meanings, rushing towards a dazzling goal, becoming spiritualized and transformed from century to century, from day to day. Rows of upcoming epochs begin to shine through, each with its own unique characteristics and a combination of meta-historical elements struggling within it. The aim of the Rose of the World is to become a receiver, multiplier, and interpreter of this knowledge. As the mystical collective mind of humanity, she will comprehend the historical process in its past, present, and future in order to enter into creative leadership of it. If it is possible to speak of any dogmas in her teachings, then it is a deeply dynamic, multi-aspect, and capable of further enrichment and development, of long-term improvement.

^^1: By planetary cosmos is meant the totality of layers of various materiality, of different spatial and temporal coordinates, but invariably connected with the sphere of the Earth as a planet. The planetary cosmos is the earthly sphere in all the complexity of its material (not just physical) layers of existence. Similar powerful systems exist for many celestial bodies. They are called brahmaturas. The brahmatura of the Earth is named Shadanakar. As for these words, like many others used here for the first time or changed in meaning with new implications, it is worth looking at a small dictionary attached at the end.

From this follows another, fourth, distinction of the Rose of the World: the perspective of consecutive spiritual-historical tasks, which are quite specific and fundamentally achievable. I will list again the nearest ones: the unification of the Earth into a Federation of states with an ethical controlling body over it, the spread of material prosperity and a high cultural level to the population of all countries, the upbringing of generations in an ennobled image, the reunification of Christian churches and a free union with all religions of a bright direction, the transformation of the planet into a garden and states into brotherhood. But these are only first priority tasks. Their implementation will open the way to solving even higher tasks: the spiritualization of nature.

So, interreligiousness, the universality of social aspirations and their specificity, the dynamism of views and the sequence of world-historical tasks - these are the features that distinguish the Rose of the World from all religions and churches of the past. The bloodlessness of its paths, the painlessness of its reforms, kindness and tenderness towards people, waves of emotional warmth spreading around - these are the features that distinguish it from all political and social movements of the past and present.

It is clear that the essence of the state, as well as the ethical character of society, cannot be transformed in an instant. A complete rejection of coercion from the outset is a utopia. However, this element will diminish over time and in public space. Every discipline consists of elements of coercion and consciousness, and the proportion between these two elements determines the type of discipline. The discipline of slave economies, prisons, and concentration camps has the highest percentage of coercion and almost no consciousness. A little more consciousness is present in military drill. And as the element of coercion weakens in disciplinary systems, the categorical imperative of self-discipline will replace it. The entire new pedagogy will be based on cultivating this impulse. The principles and methods of this pedagogy, as well as the methods of re-educating and rehabilitating criminals, will be discussed in one of the last chapters. But it is already clear, it seems, that the stimulus of external coercion will rapidly diminish in the inner concentric circles of the Rose of the World. For it will be these people, who have completely fused their lives with its tasks and ethics, and who no longer need external coercion, who will fill these inner circles. It is precisely these people who will be its conscience, and who else but them should occupy the seats of the Supreme Council?

And can we overestimate the educational value of such social structures, when at the top of society there are leaders who create and act with the greatest dignity: not those whose willpower is hypertrophied at the expense of other faculties of the soul and whose strength lies in an indiscriminate attitude towards means, but those in whom harmoniously developed will, reason, love, purity of thoughts, and deep life experience are combined with obvious spiritual gifts - those whom we call righteous people. Quite recently we saw an example of this: we saw the fateful hour of India and the great soul Gandhi. We saw an amazing spectacle: a man who had no state power, under whose authority there was not a single soldier, not even a personal servant, who had no roof over his head and walked in a loincloth, became the conscience, the spiritual and political leader of three hundred million people, and one of his quiet words was enough to unite these millions in a common bloodless struggle for the liberation of their country, and the shedding of the enemy's blood led to a nationwide fast and mourning. It is easy to imagine how tragically distorted the historical path of the Indian people would have been if, instead of this activist at the decisive moment, a person of a one-sided willful type had emerged as the leader, like Mussolini or Stalin, a so-called "strong personality", a master of demagogy and political intrigue, masking his despotism with tirades about the public good! How brilliantly he would have played on the lowest instincts of the people, on their natural hatred of conquerors, on envy of the rich; what waves of fire and blood would have swept over India, flooding the islands of high ethical consciousness, which for thousands of years were strengthened and cherished by the best sons of the great nation! And what tyranny would have been erected in the end over the tortured country, using the tendency to obedience created by centuries of slavery! Gandhi directed the liberating and creative enthusiasm of the nation along a different path. Here is the first example in modern history of that force which will gradually replace the sword and the whip of state power. This force is the living trust of the people in those who have proved their moral height; this is the authority of righteousness.

I anticipate many objections. One of them is as follows: yes, this was possible in India, with its unique characteristics, four-thousand-year-old religious history, and the ethical level of its people. Other nations have different legacies, and India's experience cannot be transferred to any other country. It is true that every nation has its own legacy. And India's legacy led its people to become pioneers on this path. But almost every nation has seen dictatorships and tyrannies of various hues, diverse ideological camouflage, and each one could see the abyss into which blind power, unenlightened righteousness, and not even meeting the demands of the average moral level, were leading the country. And yet, state leadership is a feat, and the average moral level is too small for that. Many peoples have seen this too because where instead of dictators, political parties alternate, there diplomats and generals, bosses and lawyers, demagogues and businessmen change, some are more selfish, others more ideological, but none can breathe new, pure, and fervent spirit into life, or solve urgent national problems. Nobody can trust any of them more than themselves because none of them even thought about what righteousness and spirituality is. These are wandering shadows, fallen leaves caught by the winds of history. If the Rose of the World does not come onto the world stage in time, they will be scattered by the fiery breath of willful and ruthless dictatorships. But if the Rose of the World appears, they will dissolve, melt under the rising sun of the great idea because people's hearts trust one righteous person more than a hundred contemporary politicians. But even more powerful and brighter will be the impact on the people and their destiny if the three highest gifts - righteousness, the gift of religious preaching, and artistic genius - are combined in one person.

Many, oh so many manifestations of religion relate entirely to its past stages. One such manifestation, apparently, is the power over the minds of strictly defined, apodictic, undeveloped, statuary dogmas. The experience of the last centuries and the growth of personality have led to the fact that man feels the conditionality and narrowness of any dogmatism. Therefore, no matter how un-dogmatic the theses of the Rose of the World may be, no matter how permeated with the spirit of religious dynamics they are, many will still struggle to accept them. But many, many will respond to its call, as long as it is addressed not so much to the intellect as to the heart, sounding in the genius creations of words, music, theater, architecture. Artistic images are more vivid and multi-aspectual than the aphorisms of theosophy or philosophical reasoning. They leave more freedom to the imagination, they allow each person to interpret the doctrine in a way that is more organic and understandable for their individuality. Revelation flows along many channels, and art - if not the purest, then the broadest of them. Therefore, all kinds of art and the beautiful cult will dress the Rose of the World in sounding and shining covers. And that is why the most natural leader of the Rose of the World is the one who has combined three greatest gifts: the gift of religious preaching, the gift of righteousness, and the gift of artistic genius. Perhaps such a person will not come or will not come soon. Perhaps the Rose of the World will be led not by him, but by a collective of the most worthy. But if Providence directed such a great soul to our century - and It already has - and the demonic forces could not eliminate it, it would be the greatest happiness for the whole earth. Because no one can have a more powerful and luminous influence on humanity than the influence of a genius word artist who has become a spiritual leader and righteous person and has been raised to the heights of world leadership by social and cultural achievements. It is only such a person who can be entrusted with the extraordinary and unprecedented task in history: ethical control over all the states of the Federation and the leadership of the peoples on the path of transforming these states into a universal brotherhood.

Oh, we Russians have paid a heavy price for our unconditional trust in a strong person, who many of us have taken for a benefactor of humanity. Let us not repeat this mistake! There are unmistakable signs that distinguish a person worthy of such a mission from an evil genius of the nation. The latter is gloomy, while the former is joyful in spiritual merriment. One strengthens their power through executions and punishments, while the other will never seek power in their lifetime and, when they do assume it, will not spill anyone's blood. One propagates the cult of their personality, which is under their control, throughout the land; the other finds it repulsive and comical. One is inaccessible, the other is open to all. One is consumed by an insatiable thirst for life and power, and hides behind impenetrable walls of imaginary danger; the other is free from the temptations of life, and in the face of danger, they are calm because their conscience is pure and their faith unshakable. These are two antipodes, messengers of two irreconcilable principles.

Of course, in the Supreme Council, such a chosen one would only be the first among equals. They would rely on the cooperation of the multitude in everything, and their own activity would be controllable by this multitude. They could only come to this extraordinary position through a strict selection process. Such a position cannot be held by youth or even middle age, only by old age. Temptations and struggles of passions must have long been overcome. As for the election itself, it seems to me that it could only be carried out through some form of plebiscite. Moreover, during the years of the supreme mentor's rule, the Council would monitor their actions. Deviation from the path would lead to the transfer of power to a more worthy individual. In general, all issues related to this could be carefully thought out, dangers foreseen, decisions weighed carefully, and subsequently improved. But as long as the supreme mentor follows the predetermined path, they are a mystical connection between living humanity and the world above, a manifestation of the Providential will, an improver of billions, and a defender of souls. In the hands of such a person, it is not scary to combine the fullness of spiritual and civic power.

Some may say that such people appear once every five hundred years. But I will say more: personalities of this caliber, possessing a sum of these particular qualities, could not have existed in the past. Einstein could not have appeared among the Maori people of the 19th century; Dostoevsky, as we know him, would have been futile to hope to find among the subjects of Tutankhamun or Theodoric. Then he would have had a different set of qualities, and many of them would not have had the opportunity to manifest in life. Such a person, of whom I speak, even in the most prosperous era, could not have realized the gifts bestowed upon him, and contemporaries would have remained completely ignorant of his true scale and potential. The necessary conditions, apparently, are already emerging in the current era; Rose of the World will create them so that the social and cultural atmosphere ensures the chain of successors worthy of this crown to the supreme mentor.

It may also be said that even all these gifts are not enough for such extraordinary activity; one must possess a broad, sober, and practical state mind. Yes, of course. Such a performer will have to deal with thousands of diverse problems; knowledge, experience, and erudition - economic, financial, legal, and even technical - will be required. But the age of Aristotle has long passed; minds of encyclopedic coverage are unimaginable in our time. And the activity of the person I am talking about is as unthinkable in isolation from the collective mind, from the Supreme Council. The deepest minds, people seasoned in the vicissitudes of state life, specialists in all branches of knowledge will participate in it. Not encyclopedic erudition or practical economic sense will be required of the supreme mentor, but wisdom. Wisdom that understands people at first sight, that immediately finds their essence in the most complex questions, and that never turns a deaf ear to the voice of conscience. The supreme mentor must stand at such a moral height that love and trust in him would replace other methods of governance. Coercion, violence against another's will, are painful for him; he uses them only in the rarest cases.

And yet this is only one of the possible options, although, in my personal opinion, the most desirable one. It is quite possible to have a leadership of the Rose of the World, such a relationship with legislative institutions and with the government of the Federation, in which the principle of collectivity will not be limited by anything or anyone. The time to develop the constitution of the future is in the distant future, and it will be up to our happy descendants, not us, to choose one of many options. But is it not a theocracy? - I do not like the word "theocracy". Theocracy means the rule of God; to apply it to any social and state structure is absurd from the point of view of an atheist, sacrilegious from the point of view of a believer. History knows no theocracy and cannot know it. It is theocracy by the priesthood, the power of the clergy, that should be called a papal or dalai-lama church-state. And the structure I am talking about is directly opposite to any theocracy: not only does the church dissolve in the state, which has absorbed it and is dominant in its name, but also the whole conglomerate of states, and the assembly of churches gradually dissolve into the all-human brotherhood, into the inter-religious church. And it is not the highest hierarchs of the church who occupy seats in the highest bodies, legislative, executive, and controlling, but the best representatives of all peoples, all faiths, all social strata, all professions. It is not theocracy, not monarchy, not oligarchy, not republic: something new, qualitatively different from everything that has existed before. This is a world order, striving for the sanctification and enlightenment of the entire life of the world. I do not know what it will be called then, but the name is not important, the essence is. And the essence of it is the work for the sake of spiritualization of man, spiritualization of humanity, spiritualization of nature.

### Chapter 2. Attitude towards culture

Gradually, a new attitude is emerging towards everything: the existence of the Rose of the World would have no meaning if it only repeated what was said before. A new attitude towards oneself, a new understanding is literally evoked by all phenomena, from the great to the small: the cosmic process and the historical process, the world laws and the connection between different material worlds, human relationships and the paths of personality development, states and religions, the animal kingdom and the elements - in short, everything that we unite under the concept of "culture" and everything that we unite under the concept of "nature". A new attitude is emerging towards everything, but this does not mean that every old attitude is devalued or disgraced: in many cases, only such a point of view is indicated, under which different past attitudes can cease to contrast with each other, begin to complement each other and must be read as different series of aspects of one and the same or many realities. This is often applied, for example, when considering old religions and the realities behind them.

In essence, the entire book is devoted to this new attitude towards things: such a problematic is too extensive and complex to be even briefly outlined in one chapter. This chapter, "Attitude towards culture", and the next, "Attitude towards religions", are not expected to provide a detailed presentation of these topics. The new understanding of different cultural areas, different historical phenomena, different religious systems, as well as different realms of nature, saturates all twelve books of this work. The first chapters are equivalent only to an introduction. They contain a summary presentation of some basic principles, and nothing more.

The leading area of culture in our era is science. The scientific method of knowledge claims hegemony; therefore, this chapter begins with a characterization of the Rose of the World's attitude specifically towards the scientific method. It must be said bluntly and without reservation that no matter how many illusions enthusiasts of the scientific method may create on this score, it has never been, will never be, and cannot be the only method of knowledge or the only method of mastering matter. Not to mention the artistic method, with which the scientific method arrogantly and reluctantly shares its dominant position now, it should be reminded that the foundations of a methodology for knowledge and mastery of materiality have long been laid, the assimilation of which is inseparably linked to spiritual self-improvement of a person, to the enlightenment of his ethical image. Even the possibility of such historical stages when this methodology will come to some primacy looms ahead. I mean not so much discredited concepts like magic or occultism due to a number of misunderstandings, as the concept of spiritual doing. Various systems and schools of this kind exist in all highly developed religions. Developing practical techniques of willpower on the human body and external matter over the centuries and leading a person to this only after lengthy moral preparation and multifaceted skill, they have raised and continue to raise hundreds, perhaps even thousands, of people to what is called miracle-working in common parlance. This methodology, extremely laborious and provoking burning hatred from modern philistines, is distinguished by one principle that is alien to science: the principle of improving and transforming one's own being, as a result of which the physical and etheric coverings of the personality become more flexible, elastic, and more obedient instruments of will than ours. This path leads to such legendary phenomena as physical passage through objects in the three-dimensional world, movement through the air, walking on water, instantaneous overcoming of enormous distances, healing of the incurable and the blind, and finally, as the highest and extremely rare achievement, the resurrection of the dead. Here we see mastery of the laws of our materiality and subordination of the lower to the higher, which are still unknown to us. And if in the 20th century most of us manage to live our whole lives without encountering undeniable cases of such phenomena, then this does not mean that such phenomena do not exist or are fundamentally impossible, but only that the conditions of the irreligious era - cultural, social, and psychological - make it so difficult to study and absorb this methodology (especially in the West and even more so in socialist countries) that the number of such cases is reduced to a few. Some truly fateful events for humanity that took place about two thousand years ago - they will be discussed later - are to blame for the fact that involving not individuals, but multiple human beings in this path of knowledge and mastery of matter proved impossible. In the future, the psychological climate of the irreligious era increasingly hindered progress along this path. Today, mastery of this methodology is extremely difficult, and in some countries it is practically impossible. But there is no reason to believe that this path will remain slow and laborious forever: the irreligious era is not infinite, we live at its end. It is difficult to imagine anything as cumbersome, imperfect, crude, and pitiful as the achievements of modern technology compared to the achievements of the methodology I am talking about. If the same resources and incalculable human reserves that are now absorbed by the development of scientific methodology were devoted to its development and assimilation, the panorama of human life, our creativity, knowledge, social structure, and moral character would change fundamentally. The psychological climate of the era of the Rose of the World will create such favorable conditions for the development of this methodology as never before. But this is a matter of the future, and not a very close one. For now, we have to mainly use another methodology, much less perfect, not leading far, but universally dominant now.

Hence the overall attitude of the Rose of the World towards science and technology at the current historical stage. Laboriously accumulating facts, deriving from them certain regularities, without understanding their nature or direction, but mechanically mastering them and being unable to predict what inventions and social upheavals will result from their discoveries - science has long been accessible to everyone, regardless of the moral character of each individual. The results are before our eyes and over our heads. The main result is that no person on earth is guaranteed that a hydrogen bomb or some other even more stunning achievement of science will not be dropped on him and his fellow citizens at any moment by highly intelligent minds. It is therefore natural that one of the first measures of the Rose of the World after taking control of the activities of the state will be the creation of a Supreme Scientific Council - that is, such a college that will be distinguished by the inner circles of the Rose of the World. Composed of individuals combining high scientific authority with high moral character, the Council will take control of all scientific and technical activities, directing its work along two paths: planning and safeguarding.

Everything related to safeguarding the interests of humanity is generally clear enough, at least in its principles, and there is hardly any need to dwell on this here. As for the problems associated with safeguarding the interests of the animal and plant kingdoms, they will be illuminated in the corresponding sections of the book devoted to the animal world and the worlds of the elementals. Because this is perhaps the only area where the views of the Rose of the World and the views of most contemporary scientists cannot be reconciled. However, this contradiction does not affect any conclusions of science, but only some of its specific practical methods, which are not only incompatible with the eyes of the Rose of the World, but also in the eyes of almost any religious-moral teaching and even almost any humane person's elementary requirements for good.

Apart from these purely methodological contradictions, there are no points of collision between the Rose of the World and science, and there cannot be. They have nowhere to collide. They are about different things. Perhaps it is not accidental that the majority of the great scientists of the 20th century were able to possess personal religiosity without hindering their scientific erudition, without preventing them from sharing and even creating bright spiritualistic systems of philosophy. Einstein and Planck, Pavlov and Lemaitre, Eddington and Milne, whatever the areas of their scientific research, remained deeply believing individuals in their own way. Of course, I am not taking into account the Soviet period Russian scientists, some of whom were forced to declare their materialism not for philosophical reasons, but for reasons understandable to everyone else. Let us leave philosophy and politics alone: in purely scientific areas, the Rose of the World does not assert anything that science has the right to deny. What is apparent is that science is silent on the realities that the Rose of the World asserts. But this is a temporary phenomenon. As for the social, cultural, and ethical problems that the Rose of the World will strive to solve, it is impossible to imagine that they will be met with any substantive objections from scientific authorities.

It is thought that the idea of planning science will no longer be the subject of discussion, but rather the boundaries of what is covered by planning and its practice. Special study of the practice of planning and coordinating scientific work in some states in the mid-20th century will probably not be without interest. However, only individual details can be used, if only because the Federation will consist of many states, large and small, just united, standing at different stages of economic development, formed in the midst of different cultures and possessing different socio-political systems. Some of these systems, which differ in greater socialization of economic relations, will be more easily involved in the general inevitable process of world socialization; others, accustomed to the anarchy of production, will be gradually drawn into it. All this, as well as the diversity of cultural types, will create an extraordinary diversity in the world economy in the first period and different cultural systems that are inactive towards each other. National antagonisms will still be felt for a long time. It will not be possible to balance and coordinate the needs of individual countries and individual segments of the population interested, for example, in the priority development of certain industries here and there or in the sale of their products somewhere else, immediately. Those who will lead the Scientific Council and the Rose of Peace will require a new psychological quality for a fair solution to these problems: overcoming in themselves the dominance of local, still natural, cultural and racial ties, complete national impartiality. How much effort, what authority and even self-sacrifice will be required, at least to weaken outdated antagonisms - Anglo-Arab, for example, Russo-Polish or Armenian-Turkish! What behavior will Germans, Englishmen, Russians, or Americans deserve to forget the enmity they have aroused in so many nations? What educational means will be required to destroy the complex of suppressed self-esteem that prevents many small and medium-sized nations from being friendly to their neighbors and turns into aggressive dreams of achieving their own greatness at the expense of the greatness of others? But this is only one side of the task. Many Western nations will have to eradicate the slightest traces of the ancient sense of superiority over others in themselves. The Russian will have to understand that his country is not the crown of creation and certainly not better than many others. The Englishman will be forced to do titanic internal work to detach himself from the involuntary preference of the interests of the inhabitants of the British Isles over the interests of the inhabitants of Indonesia or Tanganyika. The French will need to learn to embrace the interests of Paraguay or Thailand as passionately as their own. The Chinese or Arab will free their hearts and minds from centuries-old, once-justified but now outdated mistrust of Europeans and learn to pay attention to the needs of Belgium or Greece no less than the needs of Zhejiang or Sudan. Latin American residents will have to unlearn the habit of caring and complaining only about themselves and participate in the distribution of global goods, taking into account the needs of Afghanistan, Cambodia, and even Yakutia. And citizens of the United States must remember that they are Christians and that Christianity is incompatible with bestial hatred of any race, even if it is black. It is difficult, very difficult - it is clear that it is terribly difficult, but getting rid of wars and tyrannies can only be achieved through this psychological self-transformation. And, of course, no one who has not completed such an operation can hope to participate in the work of global planning organizations. It will even be necessary to learn national self-sacrifice - not with one's own blood, of course, not with the lives of one's sons, but only with dollars. For the most affluent countries, it will be necessary to share their resources with the peoples of the East and South to some extent and share it selflessly, without any hope of making this assistance a successful business. In short, everyone involved in the leadership of the Rose of the World must first feel like a member of the cosmic whole, then a member of humanity, and only after all of this - a member of their nation. And not the other way around, as we have been taught so far. 

Because the ultimate goal of the Rose of the World, or rather, of the gigantic spiritual process that began millennia ago and of which the Rose of the World is only a stage, is enlightenment of Shambhala. The immediate task of this epoch is to establish material prosperity, simple well-being, and elementary moral relations between people everywhere, leaving no one beyond its reach. The thesis that all people without exception should be provided with work, rest, leisure, a peaceful old age, cultural housing, the enjoyment of all democratic freedoms, and the satisfaction of basic material and spiritual needs, will begin to be rapidly realized. Only in the last chapters will I be able to shed light on the concrete measures, the system of sequential reforms, thanks to which, as I see it, these principles can be embodied in flesh and blood. For now, it's only about the principles. Those who do not sympathize with these principles should not waste their time and energy reading further, while those who sympathize should understand the inner spirit of the Rose of the World before turning to reflection on the ways of realizing these ideals in life.

This is the principle of the Rose of the World's attitude towards science and technology, as far as it can be conveyed without delving into meta-historical and trans-physical depths. And this should be the role of the scientific method in the series of immediate epochs.

Several decades will pass. The progressive growth of productive forces will reach a level that we will be able to call universal prosperity. The living conditions that citizens of advanced countries enjoy now will be established in the most remote corners of the globe. The allocation of the immense sums of money that are now spent on armaments for peaceful purposes will give economic progress almost unimaginable momentum. The period of universal primary education will probably be overcome in all countries even earlier, and in the future, even universal secondary education will begin to appear insufficient. The outlines of the intelligentsia will coincide with the outlines of humanity. The development of new means of communication, their accessibility, and their comfort will practically eliminate the problem of international and intercultural space. The working day, decreasing more and more, will release new reserves of time. Physiology will develop equipment to help the human brain quickly and firmly memorize the information it receives. Leisure time will increase. And the questions that most people are concerned about now - the interests of the economy, the organization of production, the improvement of products, industrial technology, and the further improvement of living facilities - will lose their urgency. It is even quite likely that those generations will not understand and will find it strange how their predecessors could be so engrossed and agitated about such boring and flat problems. The reserves of energy will be turned towards creating higher-order values because the material basis of life will be immune to any fluctuations, comprehensive, and completely stable.

Technical and economic problems will no longer attract primary attention. They will be addressed within the appropriate collectives, and their publicity will be no greater than that given to issues of public kitchens or water supply, and human talent will turn to something else: to what will be dictated by thirst for knowledge, love for all living things, the need for higher forms of creativity, and a passion for beauty.

The thirst for knowledge, once driving explorers to navigate unknown seas, to wander through uncharted continents, will first propel them, possibly even before the advent of the Rose of the World, into space travel. But foreign planets are inhospitable; after a few reconnaissance expeditions, these flights will stop. And the thirst for knowledge itself will begin to change its direction. Systems will be developed for educating and unleashing in the human being the potentially inherent spiritual organs of sight, spiritual hearing, deep memory, and the ability to voluntarily separate the internal, immaterial structures of the human being from his physical body. Journeys will begin to immaterial worlds, to the opening layers of Shadanakar. It will be the era of Magellans of planetary space, and Columbuses of spirit.

What system of views on personality, its value, its rights and duties, on the path of its improvement will contribute to the establishment of a new psychological climate and hasten the advent of this golden age?

It is precisely in the fact that personality contains innate abilities for creativity and love with the divine that its absolute value is enclosed. Its relative value depends on the stage of its ascending path, on the sum of efforts - its own and Providential - expended on achieving this stage, and on the extent to which it reveals these abilities of god-making and love in life.

The earthly segment of the ascending monad's cosmic path is a stage at which its abilities for creativity and love can and should be extended to its natural and artificial environment, improving it by overcoming the tendency towards isolated self-assertion of its parts and particles at the expense of others. Evil is rooted in this tendency, no matter how it manifests itself. Its forms and scales are diverse almost to infinity, but the basis is always the same: the desire to assert oneself at the expense of others and everything else.

Ancient religions saw the relative value of a person in the degree to which they fulfilled the prescriptions of a given religious and moral code. Ascetic religions regarded sanctity as the highest level, understanding it as the purest example of monastic service or martyrdom for faith. At the same time, love took a back seat. Monastic or martyric feat was performed not out of love for people and all living beings, but out of the thirst for reunification with God and liberation from posthumous torment. Of course, I mean here the dominant direction, prevailing mood, and not the images of such amazing individual actors, apostles of love, like St. Francis, Ramajuana, or Milarepa. However monstrous it may seem to us, even the eternal torment of sinners in hell did not evoke in the majority of adherents of these religions a desire to enlighten the world's laws, including the law of retribution or karma. Eternal retribution for temporary violation of their laws seemed to them a fair act of the Deity or, in any case (as in Brahmanism), an indisputable and absolutely insurmountable law. Buddha burned with the flame of compassion like a candle, but he too taught only how to break out of the circle of the iron laws of the world, not how to enlighten and transform them. As for creativity, its innate nature was not recognized by the monad at all, not even the concept of it existed, and specific types of creativity available to humans were not considered valuable, except for religious creativity in a narrow sense: spiritual work, theology, preaching, temple construction, culture.

Other religions, not inclined towards asceticism, such as Islam and Protestantism, modified this ideal, expanding it and at the same time lowering it, making it more accessible, more popular, even to the point of fulfilling several commandments regarding God, the state, the immediate environment, the family, and finally, oneself. It must be repeated that neither group of religions set the task of transforming society, let alone nature, before anyone. Accordingly, the concept of the obligation of the individual remained stunted and narrow. Naturally, such tasks, but in an extremely simplified form, were finally set by irreligious teachings. A reduced and contradictory ethical ideal was proclaimed, mechanically combining some progressive features with those that went against the ethical minimum, which had long seemed indisputable. The old formula "the end justifies the means" was recalled and, fearing to proclaim it with honest frankness, it was practically used. When characterizing and evaluating historical phenomena, their moral quality was completely ignored; verdicts were rendered only based on the consideration of the overall progressive or reactionary direction of the given phenomenon. No one was disturbed by the fact that this led to the justification of the bloody activities of many despots of the past and even such blatant mass massacres as the Jacobin terror or the activity of the Oprichnina. Many old achievements of social progress, such as freedom of speech, the press, or religious propaganda, were discarded. Generations raised in such an atmosphere gradually lost the very need for these freedoms - a symptom that speaks more eloquently than any tirade about the stunning spiritual regression of society. Thus, as the ideal approached in the form in which it was presented in reality, even the positive that it contained was devalued. For ahead, only the kingdom of material satiety was painted, bought at the price of renouncing spiritual freedom, with multimillion human lives sacrificed and billions of souls relegated to the lower layers of Shadanakar, who gave up their divine primogeniture for a bowl of lentil soup.

One should hope that the terrible lesson will not be in vain.

The teachings of the Rose of the World point to the absolute value of the individual, to their divine primacy: the right to be free from the burden of poverty, from the burden of aggressive societies, to well-being, to all kinds of free creativity and to the publication of this creativity, to religious pursuits, to beauty. The right of human beings to a secure existence and the use of the benefits of civilization is an inherent right that does not require giving up either freedom or spirituality. To assert that there is some fatal dilemma here, that in order to achieve all natural, self-evident goods, one must sacrifice personal spiritual and social freedom, is to deceive people.

The doctrine also points to the obligations of the individual: the consistent expansion of the sphere of what is encompassed by their love, the growth, multiplication, and enlightenment of what is created by their creativity. Creativity thus becomes both a right and a duty. To this day, I cannot understand how this truly divine human ability did not receive proper recognition in any of the ancient religions, except for some forms of polytheism, especially Hellenic. It seems that only in Greece were people able to deify not only works of art, but the very creative ability itself, specifically creative, and not productive, as in other forms of polytheism, and even to crown great artists with apotheoses. It is sad and strange that after the decline of Greece, the gift of creativity ceased to attract the attention of religions and was no longer understood ontologically, metaphysically, or mystically. Under the influence of a one-sided understanding of the Semitic idea that after six days of creation, the Divine creative spirit rested, even the question of further divine creativity was preferred to be avoided by theological thought, and the speech of God, recorded in the Revelation of John - "Behold, I make all things new" - remained a singular ascent, a singular insight. Human creativity, however, was viewed with suspicion, as if the pride that a human creator could fall into was more dangerous and fatal than creative infertility. Unfortunately, no less regrettable is the view of human creativity that has been established in religions of Indian origin.

In the past centuries, Western culture, with its rich manifestations of genius in all areas of art, science, philosophy, has taught us many things. They taught us to have a reverential attitude towards human creativity and to respect human labor. However, the irreligious spirit of these centuries contributed to what the ancient religions feared: pride in one's creative talent became inherent to the human creator, as if he had created this gift within himself. Nevertheless, this self-sufficiency nested itself not so much in the souls of genuine geniuses, let alone spiritual messengers, but among the ranks of secondary figures in science and the arts. A more detailed consideration of these problems from the perspective of the teaching of the Rose of the World will be the subject of a series of special chapters in this book.

In any case, creativity, like love, is not an exclusive gift known only to the chosen ones. The chosen ones know righteousness and holiness, heroism and wisdom, genius and talent. But this is only the disclosure of potentials inherent in every soul. The depths of love and inexhaustible springs of creativity boil beyond the threshold of consciousness of each of us. The religion of the end will strive to destroy this barrier, to let the living waters break through here, into life. In generations raised by it, a creative attitude towards everything will be revealed, and even labor will not be a burden, but a manifestation of an insatiable thirst to create something new, to create the best, to create their own. All followers of the Rose of the World will enjoy creative work, teaching this joy to their children and youth. To create in everything: in word and town planning, in exact sciences and horticulture, in the adornment of life and in its softening, in worship and in the art of mysteries, in the love of men and women, in the nurturing of children, in the development of the human body and in dance, in the enlightenment of nature and in play.

Because all creativity, except for demonic creativity done in one's own name and for oneself, is an act of divinity. Through it, humans elevate themselves above themselves, worshiping not only their own hearts but also the hearts of others.

In terms of personal spiritual development, most people follow a slow and broad path. This path passes through marriage and childbearing, various forms of activity, the fullness and diversity of life experiences, its joys and pleasures. But there is also the Narrow Path, which belongs to those who have a special gift in their soul that requires strict self-restraint: the gift of holiness. Religious teachings that assert the Narrow Path as the only correct or highest path are unjust. Similarly, social or religious systems that deny it altogether and erect obstacles before those who feel called to such a path are also wrong. In the era of the Rose of the World, monasteries are unlikely to be numerous, but they will exist so that anyone whose spiritual thirst drives them to the Narrow Path can work on developing such soul abilities that require years of work in silence and seclusion. If a person embarks on the Narrow Path out of fear of retribution or because of a dream of personal, self-absorbed, closed communication with the Divine, their victories are worthless. There is no deity who rewards their faithful servants with the blissful contemplation of their greatness. The contemplation of the highest spheres is the way for the individual to exit themselves and join the One that encompasses all monads and creates the entire world. Therefore, a follower of the Rose of the World can be compelled to embark on the Narrow Path not by spiritual egoism or a thirst for personal salvation with cold indifference to others, but by an understanding that such gifts are revealed on the Narrow Path, with which the righteous will help the world more effectively from seclusion than hundreds of people living in the world, and which, after death, become such a force that even mighty demonic hierarchies bow before it.

There is no need for scary oaths accompanying the initiation ceremony. There is no basis for condemning or reviling someone who has strayed from the path after a number of years. The initiate will first take only a temporary vow: for three years, five, or seven. Only after successfully completing such stages will they, if they wish, be granted the right to take a vow for a longer period of time; and yet the awareness of irreversibility, the suspicion of an irreparable mistake, will not torment and crush them, giving rise to despair and violent outbursts of unfulfilled desires: they will know that at the end of the term they are free to return to the world, free to choose any way of life, any work, free to have a family and children, without deserving condemnation or contempt from anyone.

I have tried to anticipate the attitude of the Rose of the World towards scientific and non-scientific methods of cognition, towards personality, its rights and obligations, towards human creativity and work, and now towards the two main types of spiritual path: Broad and Narrow. To supplement the representation of her attitude towards culture, it would be necessary to dwell on her views on art - in the broadest sense of the word. But this question is so ambiguous and important, and personally so close to me, that I have decided to dedicate a series of chapters to it in one of the further parts of the book. Therefore, before moving on to the question of the Rose of the World's attitude towards other religions, I will only say a few fleeting words about the arts of the approaching era.

What are the characteristics of the art that people who are associated with the spirit of the Rose of the World will create in the coming epochs, when the sun of the golden age is only beginning to illuminate the clouds on the horizon?

It would be naive to try to predict or outline the diversity of artistic movements, genres, schools, and stylistic techniques that will emerge in this sphere of culture by the end of this century. However, it seems to me that a certain predominant style will be defined, which will not exhaust all the currents of art (in conditions of maximum freedom, this is impossible, and not necessary for the same reason), but is destined to become a kind of "mainstream" in art and literature in the last third of the century. In this style, Rose Mira's inherent perception of things will find its expression: a perception that sees through layers of physical reality to other immaterial or spiritual layers. Such a worldview will be far from intentional optimism, afraid to disturb its own tranquility by paying attention to the dark and tragic sides of existence. The creators of this art will not avoid contemplating the mournful and terrible underside of the world. They would consider it cowardly to want to forget about the bloody path of history, about the reality of the ominous, infra-physical layers of Shadanakar, about their merciless laws, which hold in bondage the inhuman torments of countless unhappy beings, and about the most frightening outbursts of the human spirit, which are prepared by the forces of the Antigod and will almost inevitably come to pass in history when the golden age has exhausted its forward movement. However, a high degree of awareness will not hinder their love for the world, for the earth, and will not diminish their joys, born of nature, culture, creativity, social service, love, friendship - on the contrary! Does awareness of hidden dangers that threaten those you love weaken the passion of love? There will be wonderful creations of unprecedented completeness of life affirmation, purity, and joy. In the streams of all the arts - those that already exist and those that will arise - there will appear sparkling works of the creators of the future about love, more multifaceted than ours, about youth, about the joys of home and social activity, about the expansion of human consciousness, about the widening of the boundaries of perception, about the elements that have become friendly with humans, about the daily proximity of as-yet-invisible friends of our hearts, and about many other things that will excite the people of those epochs, and that we cannot even imagine.

It seems to me that such an art, brave in its fearlessness and feminine in its love, is a wise combination of joy and tenderness towards people and the world, with a keen understanding of its dark depths. It could be called permeating realism or meta-realism. And should we even say that a work of art necessarily needs to be an example of permeating realism for people who are connected to the spirit of the Rose of the World to be able to enjoy and admire it? They will enjoy everything that is marked by talent and at least one of these characteristics: a sense of beauty, a wide range of coverage, depth of thought, sharpness of eye, purity of heart, and joy of soul.

There will come a time when the ethical and aesthetic level of society and of the artists themselves will be such that there will be no need for any restrictions, and the freedom of art, literature, philosophy, and science will be complete. But between the moment when the Rose of the World takes control of the states and the era of this ideal level, several decades will pass. The idea might arise not from wisdom but from youthful immaturity that society has already reached the heights of development where absolute freedom cannot generate fatal, irreversible abuses. Initially, it will be necessary to entrust the local branches of the World Art Council, among other more encouraging functions, with this one control, through which the artistic work will pass before it is made public. This will be - if the reader will excuse the pun - the swan song of censorship. At first, when national antagonisms and racial prejudices have not yet been eliminated and aggressive organizations still play on these prejudices, a ban will have to be imposed on any propaganda of hatred between certain population groups. Later, control will still be maintained over books and textbooks popularizing scientific and philosophical ideas, but only to prevent them from being incomplete, lightweight, or distorting objective facts, and not to mislead unqualified readers. I think that control over artistic works will still be maintained, requiring them to have a certain minimum amount of artistic merit and protecting the book market from being flooded with tasteless, aesthetically illiterate rubbish. And finally, the unconditional ban on pornography will probably be the most persistent. With the abolition of each of these restrictions, another measure will replace it: after the release of a substandard work, the World Art Council or World Scientific Council will publish their authoritative judgment on it. That will be enough. Of course, it will not be easy to develop a system for filling seats in these councils that would guarantee all areas of culture against the intervention of people with narrow partisan or narrow school views, intolerant supporters of any one artistic trend or philosophical concept, or defenders of the creative interests of a limited group, nation, or generation. However, I do not think that in the psychological atmosphere of the Rose of the World.

If we don't delve into the distinction between the concepts of culture and civilization, we can say that culture is nothing but the collective creativity of humanity. And if creativity is the highest, most precious, and sacred ability of human beings, a manifestation of their divine spirit, then there is nothing more precious and sacred on earth than culture, especially the more spiritual the cultural layer, cultural area, or cultural creation.

Humanity's universal culture is still emerging; so far, we have only seen fully formed cultures of individual super-national groups, i.e., groups of nations united by a jointly created, unique culture. But each of these cultures is by no means exhausted by the sphere that exists, develops, and occupies our three-dimensional space. Those who created this culture here continue their creativity even after death - creativity that has changed, of course, to suit the conditions of the world or worlds through which the soul of the creator now passes. The idea arises of millions of such souls in community, of heavenly countries and cities over each of the super-national groups of the world, and of Arimoye, the emerging heavenly country of universal culture.

This principle of relating to culture is new and unusual. We could even note that, with further deepening and detailing, it will grow into an extensive myth if we do not understand the word "myth" as something without any reality. Here, on the contrary, we are talking about the reality of colossal proportions, which is reflected obscurely, but still reflected, in such a myth.

The atmosphere of the Rose of the World and its teachings will create conditions for the myth of culture to become accessible to every mind. And even though only a limited number of consciousnesses can grasp its esoteric complexity, the spirit of this concept, rather than its letter, will gradually become available to almost everyone. And if one delves into the psychological perspectives that the acquisition of such a concept promises from the masses' side, the hope for creating a system of measures that guarantees all areas of culture from the intervention of people who have no internal rights to lead these areas will no longer seem unattainable.

### Chapter 3. Attitude towards religions

How often do we use the word "truth" and how rarely do we try to define this concept? Let us not be confused, however, by repeating Pilate's question, and let us try to understand this concept to the best of our ability.

We call theories or doctrines true if, in our view, they express an undistorted representation of some object of knowledge. In the precise sense of the word, truth is an undistorted reflection of some object of knowledge in our mind, and as many objects of knowledge exist in the world, so too can there be many truths.

But objects of knowledge are known to us, not in and of themselves. Therefore, the truth about any object of knowledge known to us must be recognized as relative truth. Absolute truth, on the other hand, is a reflection of an object of knowledge that has been perceived "in itself" by some subject of knowledge. This kind of knowledge is fundamentally possible only when the opposition between the object and the subject is eliminated; when the subject of knowledge identifies with the object.

Absolute truth, as a universal truth, is an undistorted reflection of the great universe perceived "in itself" by someone's consciousness. Private absolute truths are undistorted reflections of some part of the universe, a part that has been perceived "in itself".

Naturally, the absolute truth of the great universe can arise only in the consciousness of a subject of knowledge comparable to it, a subject of omniscience capable of identifying with the object, capable of knowing things not only "from itself," but also "in itself." Such a subject of knowledge is called the Absolute, God, the Sun of the world.

God "in himself," as an object of knowledge, is known only by himself. His absolute truth, like the absolute truth of the universe, is accessible only to him.

It is clear that any particular truth, no matter how small the object of knowledge may be, is only accessible to us in its relative form. However, this agnosticism should not be understood as absolute: when any private subject of knowledge coincides, any monad with a subject, absolute knowledge of not only "from oneself" but also "in itself" becomes possible. Thus, a conditional agnosticism is legitimate, not an absolute one.

Private truths may have several or many variants - personal, individual varieties of one particular relative truth. In this case, objects of knowledge of small (compared to the subject) scales will be reflected in the consciousness of a series of related subjects almost or completely identically: it is precisely the relatedness of many subjects among themselves that conditions the fact that their personal variants of a certain truth are also related. If this were not the case, people would be unable to understand each other in anything. However, the larger the object of knowledge compared to the subject, the more variants it evokes. The relative truth of the Universe and the relative truth of the Deity produce as many personal variants as there are perceiving subjects.

It is clear, therefore, that all our "truths" are, strictly speaking, only approximations to the truth. And the smaller the object of knowledge, the better it can be grasped by our knowledge, the smaller the gap between its absolute truth and our relative truth about it. However, there is a limit to the relationship between the scale of the subject and the object below which the gap between absolute and relative truth begins to increase again. For example, the gap between the absolute truth of some elementary particle and our relative truth about it is extremely large. However, between the Absolute truth of the Universe, the Absolute truth of the Deity, and our relative truths about them, the gap is incomparably great.

I express thoughts that, after Kant, should, it would seem, be well-known and generally accepted. However, if they were assimilated by every religiously sensitive and religiously thinking person, no one's claims to personal or collective knowledge of the Absolute truth, no one's claims to the absolute truthfulness of any theory or doctrine, could have a place.

As shown above, Absolute Truth is only the possession of the Omniscient Subject. If any human subject were to possess such truth, for example, the collective consciousness of a specific-historical church, this would be objectively evident in the unconditional omniscience of that collective consciousness. The fact that no human collective or individual possesses such omniscience once again demonstrates the baselessness of any claim of any doctrine to absolute truth. If representatives of the Rose of the World were ever to claim absolute truth for their teaching, it would be just as baseless and foolish.

But equally baseless and foolish is the assertion that all teachings, or any one teaching, is false. There are no completely false teachings and cannot be. If an opinion were to appear devoid of even a shred of truth, it could not become a teaching, that is, a sum of ideas transmitted to someone. It would remain the property of the person who produced it, as is the case, for example, with philosophical or pseudoscientific constructions of some mentally ill individuals. Only individual particular statements can be false in the strictest sense of the word, which can create the illusion of truth borrowed from partly true theses adjacent to it in the overall system. However, there is a certain relationship between the quantity and weight of partly true and false theses, at which the sum of false ones begins to devalue the crumbs of truth contained in the teaching. Then there are teachings in which false statements not only devalue the element of truth but also turn the entire system into a category of negative spiritual values. Such teachings are commonly called "left-hand" teachings. The future teaching of the Antigod, which apparently marks the penultimate stage of world history, will be constructed in such a way that even a minimal weight of partly true elements will make the false statements appear as truthful as possible. This will result in the circumstance that this teaching will entangle human consciousness in the nets of falsehood more firmly and hopelessly than any other.

Religions that do not belong to the category of "left-hand" teachings differ from each other not in terms of the truth of one and the falsehood of the others, but along two completely different coordinates. Namely:

Firstly, due to the different levels of their ascent to absolute truth, that is, according to the decrease of subjective and epochal elements within them. This staged difference can be conditionally called a difference along the vertical.

Secondly, they differ from each other because they talk about different things and reflect different series of objects of knowledge. This type of difference - segmental differences - can be conditionally called differences along the horizontal.

Both types of differences should not be overlooked when considering the issue of the Rose of the World's attitude towards other religions.

In the development of science, we observe a continuous process of accumulating relative, partial truths and their improvement, clarification. At each stage, usually not the series of previously accumulated facts are rejected, but only their outdated interpretation. Cases where an old series of facts is questioned and rejected, as happened with alchemy, for example, are relatively rare. But in the history of religions, unfortunately, other customs prevail. Instead of successively replacing one another's spiritual insights that are not subject to doubt, we more often see how significant series of previously achieved relative and partial truths are rejected at the next stage of religious development, and our new series of them, including some old ones, is presented as absolute.

This observation is especially true with regard to the transition from so-called pagan religions to monotheistic systems.

It is clear that if we were to maintain such customs in the expanding horizons of the 20th century, we would at most create another sect. Introducing scientific methodology into religion would, of course, be a gross mistake, as illegal as transferring methods of art to the field of science. But it is high time to adopt the good practice of scientists - not to reject but to rethink the series of previously accumulated relative truths.

From what has been said, it follows that no doctrines other than those of the "left hand," recognized primarily by their spiritually disintegrating effect, can be completely rejected. They must be recognized as insufficient, burdened with subjective-human contributions: epochal, class-based, racial, individual. However, a kernel of relative truth, a kernel of knowledge "from us" of one or another area of the transphysical world, exists in each of the religions, and each such truth is precious for all of humanity. Naturally, the volume of truth in systems that have developed as a result of the experience of many individuals is usually greater than the volume of truth in systems that are only spread among small groups. Exceptions can be young systems that may rise to wide dissemination, but, as a matter of course, first pass through the stage of cellular or limited-group existence.

Such widely disseminated systems are called myths in this concept—as will be explained in more detail below. Behind myths, there is always some transphysical reality, but it cannot be free from distortion and confusion caused by the multitude of "human, all-too-human" contributions to the myth. The methodology for releasing the transphysical kernel of myths from their human shell is unlikely to be strictly and precisely formulated, at least not yet. It has not been possible to develop the necessary mechanism of criteria for this, which would be sufficient in any case. And it is doubtful whether such a complex mystical task can be solved with just one rational approach. However, one can construct a classification of religions based on the teleology of history, which would allow one to identify highly developed religions as a special group and to verify that there are theses affirmed by this group of religions, although with varying degrees of purity and strength. These include: the thesis of the unity of God, the plurality of various spiritual hierarchies, the plurality of different meanings of the worlds, the infinite plurality of becoming monads, as well as the existence of a certain common moral law, which is characterized by this or that posthumous retribution for human deeds in life. In all other respects, and even in the interpretation of the common theses just listed, myths either contradict each other or speak of different things.

However, while in many cases the individuality of the subject introduces something foreign and purely human into the representations of the knowable, on the other hand, there are just as many cases where some spiritual truth can only be perceived by a specific configuration of the knowing consciousness. Individuality turns out to be a factor that does not cloud cognition, but, on the contrary, makes it truly possible. The teleological process in the religious history of humanity partly consisted in the fact that the consciousness of a particular personality, people, race, or era was polished by the influence of historical and biographical factors in such a way as to make it capable of perceiving the truths of this transcendent reality. To other individuals, peoples, races, and eras, such polished consciousness and its religious experience may have seemed strange, distorted, or immature, fraught with all kinds of aberrations.

Of the hundreds of possible examples, I will take one very bright one for now: the idea of reincarnation. Deeply inherent in Hinduism and Buddhism, and present in esoteric Judaism (Kabbalah), this idea is rejected by Orthodox Christianity and Islam. But should we think, based on this "non-universality" of the idea, that it represents a racial or stage-cultural aberration of Indian consciousness? The point is that in coordinating the theses of different religions, one must first learn to sift the main from the secondary, the common from the particular. The "common," the main thing in any thesis, lies in the seed of the idea, which shows extraordinary stability over the centuries: thrown into the soil of different cultural environments, it gives rise to different shoots - different variations of the given thesis. If there is any teleological directionality in history at all, then, of course, this directionality must first of all be reflected in the being of such stable spiritual seeds - in the widely spread, professed by millions of consciousnesses, foundations of ideas.

The seed of the idea of reincarnation consists of the teaching about a certain Self that undergoes its cosmic development, or a known segment of it through successive existences in our physical world. Everything else, such as the spiritual-material nature and structure of the reincarnating Self, a certain dependence of reincarnations on the law of karma, the extension of the principle of reincarnation also to the animal world, or the denial of such extension - all these are just variations and modifications of the basic idea. It is clear that in these variations and details one can encounter more and more genuine aberrations than in the seed of the idea, for the perception of which the Indian people's teleological forces worked for many centuries, expending incredible effort to weaken in many of its representatives the midriff between daytime consciousness and deep memory - the repository of memories of the soul's paths up to the moment of its last incarnation. The fallacy of religious dogmas lies mostly not in their content but in the claims that the law asserted by the dogma has universal, cosmic significance, and that the fact asserted by the dogma must be professed by all humanity, for without this there is supposedly no salvation. All that has been stated leads us to the recognition of the genuineness of that spiritual experience which crystallized into the idea of reincarnation: yes, such a path of development exists; there is nothing essentially unacceptable here either in Christianity or Islam in the essence of this idea, except, perhaps, that no statements by the founders of Christianity or Islam have reached us regarding the idea of reincarnation (which, however, does not prove anything in itself, since it is well known that not everything they said has made its way into the Gospels and the Qur'an). But it does not follow at all that the path of reincarnation is supposedly the only possible, the only real path of the individual spirit's development. The consciousness of the Indian people, polished in this direction to comprehend this type of path, as often happens in such cases, absolutized its discovery, becoming deaf to the perception of other types of paths of development. The same thing happened with the Jewish and Arab peoples, but under the opposite sign: having perceived the truth about another type of development path, in which incarnation in the physical layer takes place only once, the consciousness of these peoples just as unjustifiably absolutized this second type of path. This is also facilitated by the fact that in different metacultures of humanity, one or another type may generally prevail. As a result, there arose between the two groups of world religions a divergence. In reality, both of these antagonistic ideas are true in their essence, fixing two possible types of paths, and to resolve this "contradiction" nothing is required except for each side to abandon claims of universal exclusivity for their idea.

So, one of the historical reasons for the alleged irreconcilable contradictions between religions lies in the illegitimate absolutization of any thesis.

Here is another reason. One of the main dogmas of Christianity, as is known, is the teaching of the Trinity of the Godhead. The founder of Islam rejected this dogma, suspecting in it a reminiscence of polytheism, and more importantly, because his own spiritual experience did not contain a positive indication of such a truth. But in the 20th century, it is hardly worth repeating the arguments of Christian theologians who once proved and explained the fundamental difference between the dogma of the Trinity and polytheism: it is so elementary that, one would assume, even among Muslim thinkers, there will be no one who, understanding the questions of Christian doctrine, would insist on this erroneous statement. As for the second argument - that Muhammad's spiritual experience did not contain confirmation of the Trinity - it is logically flawed. No one's experience can contain confirmation of all true ideas that arose earlier in the course of collective human understanding of God and the world. Every personal experience is limited, and only the wisdom of the Omniscient (which encompasses the sum of truths "in itself" over the ages) can comprehend them all. Therefore, the fact that Muhammad did not experience anything that confirms the thesis of the Trinity itself should not serve as an argument for refuting this idea, even in the eyes of orthodox Muslims. Instead of the formula "The Prophet, having known the perfect unity of God, became convinced of the falsehood of the teaching of the Trinity," it should be formulated, fairly, as follows: "The Prophet, having known the perfect unity of God, did not, however, receive indications of the Trinity of the One." It is entirely natural that Christian doctrine not only has no objections to the Muslim teaching of Unity but fully coincides with it. It only supplements this thesis with an idea that, with its stability for two thousand years and its prevalence in billions of minds, points to the truth of its foundation. What does the contradiction between these two main dogmas of two religions boil down to? Isn't it just arbitrary and illegitimate denial of one of them of what it has no data on in its own positive experience?

Now we see the second historical and psychological reason for the entrenched disagreements between religious doctrines: the unjustified denial of someone else's statement only on the basis that we do not have positive data on this issue.

Unfortunately, there are countless disagreements based solely on this logical and epistemological inconsistency. Let's consider another case known to everyone: Islam (Sunni) and Protestantism deny the legitimacy of the cult of saints, while almost all other religions accept and implement it in one form or another. The objections to this cult boil down to the idea that man does not need any intermediaries between himself and the deity, and that spiritual honors and prayers, when offered not to God, but to those who were mere humans, are sinful because they lead to the deification of man. But what does this famous formula actually mean: "Man does not need intermediaries"? If the person proclaiming this idea does not need them, then where does he get the right to speak for others, even for all of humanity? Who authorized him? Was it not the billions of people who, in almost all countries and religions, felt a living daily need for such intermediaries, which made the existence of the cult of saints psychologically possible? If we, without experiencing a need for something (there are people, for example, who do not feel the need for music), start to condemn those who do, as foolish fabricators, selfish liars, or dark ignoramuses, what will we prove by this, other than our own ignorance? The second argument is the illegitimacy of giving divine honors and prayers to those who were mere humans. But divine honors (in the monotheistic sense) are not given to them, and no one equates them with God; this idea is completely absurd, and for people who grew up in Christian countries, it is unforgivably ignorant. True, in Hinduism there is the idea of avatars - incarnations of Vishnu in human form; but they are avatars, not saints. People bow before the saints just as they would before those who have managed to overcome their human nature or before the executors of God's will, messengers of the higher world. Protestantism denies the concept of holiness altogether. However, this seems to be more of a dispute about particulars rather than the substance of the matter: after all, by rejecting the ascetic monastic ideal, Luther and Calvin did not diminish the value of worldly righteousness, although they understood it more broadly than Catholicism and somewhat prohibited their followers from turning to his spirit in prayer. This demonstrates the purity and sincerity of their thoughts, but contradicts the foundations of religious and moral worldview in general. For if righteousness, as the highest self-sacrifice for humanity in the name of God, is perfect and selfless service to Him (and if righteousness is understood in this way, then it is ridiculous to deny that it exists in the world, although it is rare in life), then it is impossible to imagine a righteous soul that after death settles into inactive bliss. With all the strength of their soul, including those that are revealed only after death, the righteous will provide help to those who are alive and below in their ascending movement. This is as natural as helping an adult child, and just as little, as this help diminishes or belittles those to whom it is directed. It is unlikely that Prophet Muhammad was unaware of this. It is to be assumed that some extremes, excesses in the cult of saints that he observed among Christians, prompted him to forbid his followers from making any such establishments. Perhaps he believed that this prohibition was balanced by the fact that deceased righteous people do not necessarily need to be reminded by the praying to provide them with invisible help. Anyway, any doctrine that affirms the truth of spiritual immortality and high moral law can only illogically assume that the spirit of the righteous in his posthumous life relates to the living inactivity and apathy. The denial of the cult of saints, or rather the righteous, is logical only from one point of view: materialistic. However, on the other hand, absolutizing the cult of saints as universally binding is equally illegitimate. There are long stages in the path of the soul, even in the path of a whole nation, when they really do not need any "mediators"; when the soul, consciously or unconsciously, feels that strengthening its independence, strength, freedom, spiritual will excludes the possibility of turning to anyone for help other than God Himself. What basis and by what right will we impose participation in the cult of saints on such a person?

The main contradiction between Christianity and other religions is the assertion of the divinity of Jesus Christ as a dogma and the worship of Him as the incarnation of one of the hypostases of the Trinity. It is well known that other religions either agree to recognize Jesus as a prophet among other prophets or ignore Him, sometimes even vigorously denying His providential mission. Christianity, on the other hand, relying on the words of its Founder that no one comes to the Father except through the Son, denies the possibility of salvation for all non-Christians.

However, it seems that we will avoid many misunderstandings and crude reductions of ideas if we try to understand all the sayings of Christ that have come down to us by asking ourselves the question: did Jesus speak in this case as a person, as a concrete historical figure who lived in such-and-such a country from such-and-such a date, or is His mind and mouth transformed into human words by the voice of God, which He hears within Himself? Each statement of Christ requires consideration precisely from this angle: is He speaking in this case as a Messenger of the truth of the spiritual world or as a human being?

For it cannot be imagined that Jesus spoke only as a Messenger at all moments of His life and never as a human being. It is unlikely that there is any doubt that in His mournful cry on the cross, "My God, My God, why have You forsaken Me?", the anguish of one of those moments when He, Jesus, as a human being, experienced the tragedy of abandonment, the tragedy of interrupting the connection of His human Self with the Divine Spirit. And in His teaching, expounded at the Last Supper, one can always hear, instead of the first-person pronoun, the God-Son, the World Logos.

All of His words preserved in the Gospel should be subjected to such a division of Christ's speech into two groups. It is absolutely clear in this case that His words about no one coming to the Father except through the Son should be understood not in the reduced, narrowed, confined, and merciless sense that supposedly no human soul will be saved except for Christians, but in the magnificent, truly spiritual, cosmic sense that every monad, having replenished itself to the end, plunges into the depths of God the Son, the Heart and Demiurge of the universe, and only through this all-completing act returns to its source, to God the Father, incomprehensibly identifying itself with Him and with the entire Holy Trinity.

One of the prominent figures of the religious and philosophical Indian community, Brahmo Samaj, Keshub Chander-Sen, expressed a very profound thought: he said that the wisdom of the Hindus, the meekness of the Buddhists, and the courage of the Muslims all come from Christ. Obviously, in this case, he understood by this name, not the historical personality of Jesus, but the Logos, which is predominantly but not exclusively expressed in Jesus Christ. In this idea, I see a way to a viewpoint that could lead to understanding between Christians and many schools of Eastern religiosity.

It also seems that some expressions that have taken root in Christian theology, which we repeat almost mechanically and which are precisely unacceptable to other faiths, need to be reviewed and clarified. For example, how should we understand the term "incarnation" in reference to Jesus Christ? Do we still imagine that the Logos of the universe was clothed with this particular human flesh? Can we assume that through teleological preparation, a bodily instrument, an individual physical organism, a human brain capable of accommodating the Mind of the Universe, was created from generation to generation? If so, then we must assume that Jesus already possessed omniscience during his lifetime, which is not even consistent with the facts of the gospel story and his own words. Is this disproportion of cosmic and local-planetary, narrow-human categories unbearable for us? Is it unbearable not because it exceeds the limits of our understanding but because it is too obvious that it is a product of thought on a particular, long-passed cultural stage, when the universe was considered billions of times smaller than it actually is, when it seemed really possible for a solid celestial vault to fall to the ground, and a terrible hail of stars falling from the hooks on which they were suspended. Would it not be more accurate, therefore, to speak not of the incarnation of the Logos in the person of Jesus Christ, but of His expression in Him through the Great Monadic Birth that became the Planetary Logos of the Earth? We call Christ the Word, but the speaker does not embody, but expresses himself in the word: God does not embody Himself, but expresses Himself in Christ. It is precisely in this sense that Christ is truly the Word of God. And if so, then another obstacle to the agreement of Christianity with some other religious schools disappears.

I briefly touched on only four interreligious disagreements. Excluding one last one, which arises from controversy and perhaps insufficient clarity of formulations, insufficient crystallization of ideas, the rest are based on the mismatch of the spiritual experience of great visionaries, on the fact that when contemplating certain objects from different points of Shadanakar, under different spiritual angles, observers see the given object in different aspects. These disagreements can conditionally be called horizontal contradictions, meaning the legitimacy of both points of view and their apparent, rather than true, inconsistency.

Another example: since Christianity and Islam have existed, they have continued to struggle with what they call paganism. Over the centuries, humanity has been imbued with the idea of the irreconcilability, incompatibility of monotheism with polytheism, as a kind of axiom. Investigating why and how this happened would lead us too far astray. What is essential is on what basis do Semitic religions, asserting the existence of spiritual hierarchies and having developed doctrine on them - angelology and demonology - limit the diversity of these hierarchies to the few that were included in these medieval schemes? Is there even a shadow of consistency in their fundamental rejection of any experience of spiritual hierarchies - in their truthfulness? There are decisively no grounds for this, except, once again, references to the silence on this matter in the Gospels and the Koran. It was precisely because of the lack of grounds for a wholesale denial that in the first centuries of Christianity, the Church did not so much deny the gods of the Olympic pantheon as identify them with the demons and devils of Semitic canonized texts. At the same time, the character of these deities, as perceived by polytheistic cognition, was ignored, and lowering and discrediting features were arbitrarily attributed to them, or an overly anthropomorphic element, introduced into these concepts by the subject of cognition - polytheistic humanity - was deliberately emphasized, only remaining in their lower, folk variants by that time. As if recognition of the truth of the existence of hierarchies of nature, great elementals or spirit-tribe leaders, could shake the unity of God - the Creator and Builder of the universe, the source and mouth of the world's stream of life - more than recognition of His other beautiful children - angels and archangels, as well as those demons about whom the canonical teachings of the Bible were interpreted!

Unfortunately, this ancient misunderstanding has not yet been clarified: there is nothing left of ancient polytheism, but a fierce, narrow-minded, and wisdom-less intolerance is displayed every time Christian churches, or at least those who speak in their name, are called upon to express their opinion on the systems of Hindu, Chinese, Japanese, and Tibetan religions. The two other Semitic religions are equally intolerant. This is a typical case of horizontal differences between religions: not contradicting each other in essence, not colliding with each other in the vast spiritual cosmos, Christianity and Hinduism, Buddhism and Islam, Judaism and Shintoism speak of different spiritual realms, different segments of Shadanakara; but human limitation interprets this as contradictions and declares one doctrine true and the others false. "If God is one, then other gods are, so to speak, impostors: they are either demons or the product of human imagination." What a childish thought! The Lord God is one, but there are many gods; the spelling of this word in the Russian language with either a capital or lowercase letter clearly indicates differences in meaning in both cases. If repetition of this word in different senses scares anyone, let them replace it with some other term of polytheism, such as "great spirits" or "great hierarchies," but nothing will change from that, except that the use of the word "spirit" can lead to misunderstandings in some cases, because many of these gods are not spirits, but powerful beings possessing material embodiment, albeit in other, transphysical layers of existence.

All these misunderstandings-based disagreements between religions bring to mind a certain comparison I once encountered in religious literature, although I don't remember exactly where: as if several travelers climbed from different sides of the same mountain, saw and explored its different slopes, and upon returning, argued about who actually saw the real existing mountain and who saw figments of their own imagination. Moreover, each argued that the mountain was exactly as it appeared from their side, and the testimony of other travelers about other sides of it was false, absurd, and a trap for human souls. Thus, the first conclusion that can be drawn from the comparison of interreligious disagreements includes eliminating those that are based either simply on misunderstanding or on the mismatch of objects of religious knowledge in different realms of experience, that is, contradictions "horizontally."

But not only polytheism, but also animism and proto-animism are not exhausted by murky, accidental, subjective images that arose in the consciousness of primitive humanity: there is a trans-physical reality beyond them. Providence is Providence precisely because it never allowed peoples and races to be a playground of phantasms and illusions, without any possibility of coming into contact with a higher reality. We would have to recognize not God, but a dark, malevolent force as the true guide of humanity if we were to imagine that for tens of thousands of years, primitive humanity was denied any possibility of experiencing anything spiritual or at least immaterial, of coming into contact with anything other than the physical world and their own phantasms. "But what can the spiritual experience of a 'savage' enrich us with, we who stand on such a high stage of spiritual knowledge compared to him?" - "It is precisely what was understood then, in that environment, with that unique psyche, but was not transmitted, was lost, was not successively perceived by subsequent forms of spiritual knowledge in their treasury. A special study of magical beliefs and experience of pre-logical thinking from this point of view would help not only in the 'rehabilitation' of these ancient beliefs in their essential characteristics, but would also find a place for them in the now-forming synthetic religious worldview. It would be found, for example, that the ideas of the Australian Arunta tribe about a single life substance, constantly flowing in matter everywhere, from being to being, from object to object (and all the religion of this tribe consists essentially of such ideas), is the oldest revelation of humanity about the trans-physical cosmos: this is a living, most vivid, absolute experience of the unity of life force; the Australians called it arungviltja, developed Brahmanism calls it prana, and what the world science will call it in twenty or thirty years - we will still hear."

This disagreement - the assertion of the thesis of the Arungvilta-prana^^1 ancient beliefs and its denial by the overwhelming majority of later religious teachings - can be regarded as a stage disagreement, a disagreement "vertically," a disagreement between different levels of religious knowledge. But even here we encounter the same error, the same unjustified approach to another's experience that we encountered when discussing the question of Islam's denial of the cult of saints or the idea of the Trinity. And here, under all the arguments presented against the ancient revelation, the same naive line of thought is concealed: authoritative texts canonized for me say nothing about Arungvilta-prana; therefore, it does not exist. The line of thought is at least dangerous because in that case, one would have to deny the reality not only of Arungvilta-prana but also of radio waves, elementary particles, many chemical elements, galaxies, and even, for example, the planet Uranus, because canonical texts keep absolute silence about all of this.

____________
^^1: By the way, if the Gospel does not speak directly about Arungvilta-prana, it tells in detail about a long series of cases when Christ and later the apostles used this entity. It is entirely unclear how Christian Orthodox could explain the essence of that immaterial mechanism used by the perpetrators of miraculous healings if they deny the existence of life force spread everywhere.

Thus, it is also revealed that there is a decisive need to take into account what was not taken into account during the formation of ancient, so-called classical confessions: the experience of primitive spiritual knowledge, as well as what could not have been taken into account at that time due to the course of events: the experience of the centuries-long evolution of religions on all continents, the experience of world history, and the experience of science. The material from these series of experiences teaches us to approach all dogmas and theses dynamically, to be able to understand every thesis as a link in the chain of religious-historical development and to be able to divide it into two or even three layers. The deepest layer is the foundation of the idea, containing a relative particular truth. Another layer is the specific coloring, development, and detailing of the idea to the extent that an individual, racial, or epochal aspect justifies it, for it is only such a racial or epochal makeup of the soul that made it possible for this people to perceive this idea in the first place. The outermost, third layer is the shell, aberrations, the inevitable haze of human consciousness, through which the light of revelation penetrates. Therefore, the experience of all stages of development, including polytheistic, animistic, etc., must be freed from its outer layer, from the shell, rethought and included in the worldview of the religion as a whole. Of course, the principle of such work is only vaguely outlined here, the systems of criteria require enormous development, and in general, such a revision of the "religious heritage" is a colossal task that requires the joint efforts of many people; at present, there are not even enough personnel for it, let alone the other necessary conditions. But if this task is great, the sooner at least preparatory work is started, the better. The difficulties should not be underestimated, but there is every reason to hope that, given goodwill, energy, and initiative of the leaders, the gaps and rifts that currently divide all religions will gradually be filled, and although each of the religions will preserve its uniqueness and distinctiveness, some kind of spiritual union, some kind of unification will eventually unite all the teachings of the "right hand".

It is known that many Japanese who practice Christianity remain faithful to Shintoism at the same time. This is something that devout Catholics, Protestants, and even Orthodox Christians find bothersome, as they cannot understand how it is psychologically possible, and even feel that there is something sacrilegious about it. However, this is possible without sacrilege, and it is even natural because the experience of Christianity and the experience of Shintoism differ horizontally: they are about different things. Shintoism is a national myth. It is an aspect of the world's religious revelation addressed to the Japanese people and only to them. It is an understanding of the spiritual, or rather, transphysical reality that transcends the Japanese people and only manifests itself in their history and culture. Shintoism does not provide answers to questions of a cosmic, planetary, or universal nature: about the Creator of the world, the origin of evil and suffering, or the ways of cosmic evolution. It only speaks of Japan's meta-history, its meta-culture, of the hierarchies of its people, and of the heavenly assembly of enlightened souls who ascended to the higher worlds of Shadanakar from Japan. The syncretism of the Japanese, that is, their simultaneous confession of Shintoism and Catholicism, Shintoism and Buddhism, is not a psychological paradox, but, on the contrary, the first hint of how the experiences and truths of different religions should harmoniously complement each other.

Of course, before the union between Christianity and other religions and cults of the "right hand" becomes a reality - and this is one of the historical tasks of the Rose of the World - it is necessary to achieve the reunion of the Christian churches: the preparation for such a reunion, theological, philosophical, psychological, cultural, and organizational, will be carried out by the Rose of the World with unflagging enthusiasm. Until the reunification of Christianity takes place, until the Eighth Ecumenical Council (or several consecutive councils) considers the entire volume of the old dogmatics and introduces into it a series of theses based on the spiritual experience of the last thousand years, and until they sanction with the highest authority of reunited Christianity the theses of the teachings of the Rose of the World, until then, these theses may, of course, be confessed, affirmed, and preached, but they should not be cast into closed, completed, unconditional forms recommended for confession by all Christians.

In this reunification of Christian denominations and in the further union of all religions of Light for the common concentration of all forces on the improvement of humanity and the spiritualization of nature, the Rose of the World sees its supra-religious and interreligious nature.

The religious exclusivity of its followers is not only foreign to them, it is impossible. Wisdom teaches them to cooperate with all peoples in their highest ideals.

Therefore, the structure of the Rose of the World implies a series of concentric circles. Followers of any "right-hand" religion should not be honored by those outside the universal church. Those among them who have not yet reached the consciousness of supra-religious unity occupy the outer circles.

The middle circles include less active, less creative followers of the Rose of the World, while the inner circles include those who have placed the meaning of their existence in conscious and free god-making.

Let the Christian enter the Buddhist temple with awe and reverence: for thousands of years, the peoples of the East, separated from the centers of Christianity by deserts and mountain ranges, have learned about the truth of other parts of the upper world through the wisdom of their teachers. Through the smoke of the incense, here flicker the sculptures of high lords of other worlds and great messengers who spoke about these worlds to people. The Western man has not come into contact with these worlds, so let his mind and soul be enriched with the knowledge preserved here.

Let the Muslim enter the Hindu temple with a peaceful, pure, and strict feeling: false gods do not look upon him here, but conditional images of great spirits, whom the peoples of India understood and passionately loved, and whose testimony should be accepted by other peoples with joy and trust.

And let the orthodox Shintoist not pass by the inconspicuous synagogue with contempt and indifference: here another great people, enriching humanity with the deepest values, safeguards its experience of such truths with which the spiritual world was opened to it - and to no one else.

Their truths, by which the spiritual world was revealed to them - and to no one else.

The Rose of the World can be compared to an inverted flower, whose roots are in the sky, and whose petal cup is here, among humanity, on earth. Its stem is a revelation, through which spiritual juices flow, nourishing and strengthening its petals - a fragrant choir of religions. But besides its petals, it has a core: this is its own teaching. This teaching is not a mechanical combination of the highest theses of various theosophemes of the past. In addition to a new attitude toward religious heritage, the Rose of the World implements a new attitude toward nature, history, human cultural destinies, their tasks, creativity, love, paths of cosmic ascent, and the consistent enlightenment of Shadanakar. In some cases, this attitude is new because although individual figures of the past spoke about it, it is only now being accepted and confessed by religion and the church. In other cases, the attitude of the Rose of the World is new in an absolute sense because it has never been expressed by anyone before. This new attitude arises from a new spiritual experience, without which instead of the Rose of the World, only rational and fruitless religious eclecticism would be possible.

But before we delve into the contents of this spiritual experience and the foundations of this teaching, we must first understand the paths by which souls acquire this experience and the methods by which we can facilitate or accelerate its acquisition for ourselves.

## Book II. On metahistorical and transphysical methods of cognition

### Chapter 1. Some features of the metahistorical method

The expression "religious feeling" is well-known. This expression is incorrect: there is no such thing as "religious feeling" in general, but there exists an immense world of religious feelings and experiences, endlessly diverse, often contrasting with one another, different in their emotional content, in the object of their direction, in their strength, tone, and, so to speak, their color. The breadth and variety of this world is not even suspected by those who lack their own religious experience and judge it only by the testimony of others: such testimony, in the absence of personal experience, is almost always received with distrust, prejudice, and a tendency to interpret it in accordance not with the statements of the witnesses themselves, but with the dogmatic positions of non-religious schemes.

The variety of the world of religious feelings corresponds to the variety of methods of religious cognition. To expound these methods means to write a fundamental study on the history and psychology of religions. Such a task has nothing to do with the task of this book. The task of the book includes - as one of its components - the intention to give an idea only of some methods of religious cognition, namely those which, in my opinion, have the greatest creative value at the current historical stage.

The saddest mistake would be if someone suspected the author of this book of claiming a role as one of the founders of the great project - historical, cultural, and social - of creating what is here referred to as the "Rose of the World." Everything is quite different. The Rose of the World can only appear and emerge as a result of the joint efforts of a huge number of people. I am convinced that not only in Russia, but also in many other parts of the world - primarily, it seems, in India and America - the same process is taking place: the same grandiose otherworldly reality is invading human consciousness, first that of individuals, then of hundreds, in order to later become the possession of millions. Yes, now, at this very moment, people who know nothing about each other, sometimes separated by huge distances and state borders, sometimes only by the walls of a few houses, are experiencing tremendous breakthroughs of consciousness, contemplating transphysical heights and depths, and some are striving - each according to their own abilities and character - to express or at least reflect this experience in works of words, brush, and music. I don't know how many, but apparently quite a few people are standing in this stream of revelation. And my task is to express it as I experience it - and only that.

Therefore, the discussion here will not be about scientific thinking and knowledge or even about art, but about something that requires a certain restructuring of the ideas that have dominated Russia for the last forty years.

I believe that a serious investigation by researchers who have a deep understanding of modern physiology and psychology into the vast apocalyptic literature, autobiographical accounts of spiritual authors, and some religious leaders who have had similar experiences, an unbiased study and generalization of material scattered in works of comparative religion, all of this will eventually lead to the development of a scientific methodology based on which a foundation for the epistemology of religious and, in particular, meta-historical knowledge could be laid. One can imagine the emergence of scientific-pedagogical practice aimed at mastering the mechanism of this knowledge, providing individuals who have previously perceived this process passively with ways to activate and control it, at least in part. But all of this is a matter of the future, and not a close one. For now, it is certain only that the diversity of this process depends on both the subject and object of knowledge. It is impossible to embrace the unembraceable; I can only speak here about the variant of the process that I have encountered in my own life. It will be necessary to strengthen the autobiographical element in the book, although personally, under any other circumstances, I would try to avoid this element.

At the center of attention will be three types of religious knowledge: meta-historical, transphysical, and cosmic. However, it is impossible, and not necessary, to draw a completely clear line between them.

First of all, what exactly is meant here by meta-history?

"Meta-history" exists, says Sergei Bulgakov, perhaps the only Russian thinker who has put this problem at the forefront - "meta-history is the noumenal side of the universal process that, on one of its sides, opens up to us as history". However, it seems to me that applying Kantian terminology to problems of this order is unlikely to help clarify the essence of the matter. The concepts of noumenal and phenomenal were developed by a different train of thought, driven by different philosophical needs. Objects of meta-historical experience can only be squeezed into this terminology system by the method of Procrustes. Even more unwarranted is the conflation of meta-history with any kind of philosophy of history. Philosophy of history is precisely philosophy; meta-history, on the other hand, is always mythological.

In any case, the term "meta-history" is used in this book in two meanings. Firstly, as a set of processes occurring in those layers of alterity that, being immersed in other streams of time and other types of space, sometimes shine through the process perceived by us as history. These otherworldly processes are closely linked to the historical process, largely determining it, but by no means coinciding with it and are fully revealed through the paths of the specific method of cognition that should be called meta-historical.

The second meaning of the word "meta-history" is the teaching about these processes of alterity, a teaching that is, of course, not in the scientific, but in the religious sense.

There is nothing surprising about the fact that the ability to understand these processes is conditioned by various psychological, and perhaps physiological, factors in different individuals. Obviously, we are dealing with some innate predisposition; we can no more evoke or destroy it than, for example, the innate property of musicality. However, this very ability can be suppressed or simply remain unused, like a buried talent, or finally undergo development, sometimes even extremely accelerated. A scientifically educational system, which seems possible to us in the future, would promote the development of this ability. For now, the means of positive influence on this ability have to be groped almost blindly, and noticeable development of it over a lifetime would probably not have been achieved at all if certain forces, acting against our efforts, had not taken on the enormous task of developing in us the corresponding organs of perception. However, it seems quite plausible that, in addition to innate properties and active help from Providential forces, something acquired by us ourselves is also necessary for the emergence of the process of metahistorical cognition, for example - the presence of even a modest but unconditional supply of positive historical information. For a completely ignorant person who does not experience any connection with the historical stream of events, whether he lives in the Australian desert or in the thickets of a modern giant city, the metahistorical method of cognition is closed. The role of the scientific factor in the analyzed psychological process is limited to participation in the accumulation of precisely this stock of historical information and is limited to preparation for this process. The process itself, at least the variant of it that is familiar to me, has nothing to do with scientific forms of cognition. I repeat this and emphasize it.

It consists of three successive stages.

The first stage consists of an instantaneous internal act that occurs without the subject's will and, apparently, without any preliminary preparation - although, of course, such preparation, which takes place outside of consciousness, must occur in reality. The content of this act is an instantaneous experience of immense historical time periods, which is indivisible and inexpressible in words, of the essence of great historical phenomena. The form of such an act is an excessively dynamic minute or hour saturated with boiling images when the individual feels like someone who, after a long stay in a quiet and dark room, is suddenly placed under the open sky in the midst of a storm - which is terrifying in its grandeur and power, almost blinding, and at the same time filled with a feeling of overwhelming ecstasy. The individual had no idea about such a richness of life or the possibility of such a richness before. Entire epochs and the meta-historical cosmos of these epochs with great struggling principles are synthetically grasped all at once. It would be erroneous to assume that these images necessarily have a visual form. No, the visual element is included in them, as is the sound, but they relate to these elements as the ocean relates to the hydrogen in its water. It is extremely difficult to give an idea of this experience due to the absence of any reasonably precise analogies with anything else that is better known.

This experience has a stunning effect on the entire emotional makeup. Its content surpasses everything that was previously within the circle of the individual's consciousness, and it will nourish the emotional world of the one who has experienced it for many years to come. It will become his most valuable inner asset.

This is the first stage of meta-historical understanding. It seems permissible to call it a meta-historical enlightenment.^^1

____________
^^1: However, this description should not be perceived as an attempt to pre-determine the objective significance of the described psychological phenomenon in a positive sense. This will be discussed later.

The result of enlightenment continues to reside in the depths of the soul, not as a memory, but as something alive and living. Over the years, individual images, ideas, and entire concepts gradually rise up from there into the circle of consciousness, but even more remain in the depths, and the one who has experienced it knows that no concept can ever encompass and exhaust this revealed cosmos of meta-history. These images and ideas become the object of the second stage of the process.

The second stage does not have the instantaneous character of the first: it represents a certain chain of states - a chain that permeates weeks and months and manifests almost daily. This is an inner contemplation, intense immersion, focused scrutiny - sometimes joyful, sometimes painful - into historical images, but not closed in on themselves, but perceived in their unity with the second, meta-historical reality behind them. The expression "scrutiny" is used here conditionally, and by the word "images" I mean synthetic representations that include a visual element only insofar as the observed can have a visually imaginable form. At the same time, it is extremely important that the content of such contemplation largely consists of phenomena of non-dimensional layers of materiality; it is clear that they can be perceived not by physical organs of sight and hearing, but by certain other components of our being, which are usually separated from the zone of daily consciousness as if by a deaf wall. And if the first stage of the process was characterized by the passive state of a person who became an involuntary spectator of an overwhelming spectacle, then in the second stage, to some extent, the guiding action of personal will is possible - sometimes, for example, in the choice of a particular object of contemplation. But more often, and precisely in the most productive hours, images surface involuntarily, radiating, I would say, such a mesmerizing power and revealing such a multi-layered meaning that the hours of contemplation turn into the core - labile resemblances of moments of enlightenment. With a certain creative predisposition of the subject, these images in some cases can become the source or axis, the hub of artistic creations; and as grim and severe as some of them may be, the greatness of these images is such that it is difficult to find equal pleasure in contemplating them. This second stage of the process can, I think, be called meta-historical contemplation.

The painting created in this way is similar to a canvas on which individual figures and, perhaps, their overall composition are clear, but the rest is yet to be revealed. Some figures are vague, and some spaces between them are unfilled. Some parts of the background or individual accessories are entirely absent. There arises a need to clarify the unclear connections and fill the wandering voids. The process enters the third stage, which is the most free from the influence of external and irrational factors. Therefore, it is clear that the most significant errors, incorrect interpretations, and too subjective interpretations occur precisely at this stage. The main obstacle is the inevitable distortion caused by the intervention of reason, which seems almost impossible to avoid. However, it is possible to sometimes redirect the work of reason towards the inner nature of meta-historical logic. This third stage of the process can be naturally called meta-historical comprehension.

Thus, meta-historical illumination, meta-historical contemplation, and meta-historical comprehension can be recorded as three stages of the path of cognition that is being discussed.

I would like to note the possibility of another kind of state, representing a variety of the states of the first hundred days. This is a type of illumination associated with the experience of meta-historical elements of demonic nature, some of which have enormous power and a vast sphere of influence. This state, which would be correctly called an infra-physical breakthrough of the psyche, is extremely painful and mostly saturated with a sense of peculiar horror. However, as in other cases, stages of contemplation and comprehension follow this state as well.

My books, written or currently being written on a purely poetic level, are based on personal experience of meta-historical understanding. The concept, which serves as the framework for these books, is entirely derived from this experience. Where did I get these images? Who and how implanted these ideas in me? How can I speak with such confidence? Can I give any guarantees about the authenticity of my experience? - Now, here, in one of the introductory sections of the book "The Rose of the World", I answer these questions as best I can. There is nothing attractive to me about autobiographical specifics, I try to keep them to a minimum. But this minimum includes, of course, a brief report on where, when, and under what circumstances I experienced hours of meta-historical enlightenment.

The first event of this kind, which played a huge, largely determining role in the development of my inner world, occurred in August 1921, when I was not yet fifteen years old. It happened in Moscow, at the end of the day, when I, who had already become very fond of aimlessly wandering the streets and daydreaming, stopped at a parapet in one of the parks surrounding the Cathedral of Christ the Savior and overlooking the embankment. Moscow residents still remember what a wonderful view opened up from there of the river, the Kremlin, and Zamoskvorechye with its dozens of bell towers and colorful domes. It was apparently already seven o'clock, and the church bells were ringing for evening prayer... - The event I'm talking about opened before me, or rather above me, such a turbulent, blinding, incomprehensible world, embracing the historical reality of Russia in a strange unity with something immeasurably greater than it, that for many years I was internally nourished by the images and ideas that gradually flowed into my consciousness from there. The mind could not deal with them for a very long time, trying to create new and new constructions that were supposed to harmonize the contradictory nature of these ideas and interpret these images. The process quickly moved into the stage of comprehension, almost bypassing the stage of contemplation. The constructions turned out to be erroneous, the mind could not keep up with the invading ideas, and it took more than three decades, filled with complementary and deepening experience, to correctly understand and explain the chasm that had opened up in early youth.

The second event of this kind I experienced in the spring of 1928 in the church of Pokrov in Levshino, for the first time staying after the Easter morning service for the early afternoon prayer. This service, which begins around two o'clock at night, is marked, as is known, by the reading - only once a year - of the first chapter of the Gospel of John: "In the beginning was the Word." The Gospel is intoned by all the priests and deacons participating in the service from different parts of the church, verse by verse, in different languages - both living and dead. This early afternoon prayer is one of the peaks of Orthodox - indeed Christian - and indeed world worship. If the preceding morning service can be compared to the rising of the sun, then this afternoon prayer is a true spiritual midday, fullness of light and universal joy. The internal event I am talking about was very different in content and tone from the first one: much broader, as if connected with the panorama of all humanity and with the experience of World History as a single mystical stream, it gave me through the solemn movements and sounds of the service being performed before me a sense of that highest realm, that heavenly world, in which our entire planet appears as a great Temple and where the eternal worship of enlightened humanity is continuously performed in indescribable splendor.

In February 1932, during my short-term service at one of Moscow's factories, I fell ill and acquired some experience at night, in fever, which, of course, most people will see nothing but delirium, but for me it was terrifying in its content and convincing in its authenticity. The entity to which this experience pertained, I referred to in my books and designate here with the expression "third uytsraor". The strange, completely non-Russian word "uytsraor" was not invented by me, but invaded my consciousness at that time. The very simplified meaning of this giant creature, similar perhaps to the monsters of the deep sea, but incomparably superior to them in size, I would define as a demon of a great power state. This night remained for a long time one of the most painful experiences I knew from personal experience. I believe that if we adopt the term "infra-physical breakthroughs of the psyche", it will be quite applicable to this experience.

In November 1933, I accidentally -- and I mean completely accidentally -- walked into a church in Vlasyevsky Lane. There, I stumbled upon an akathist to St. Seraphim of Sarov. As soon as I opened the entrance door, a warm wave of descending choral singing rushed into my soul. I was overcome with a feeling that is extremely difficult for me to describe, let alone express in such a formal style. An irresistible force made me kneel, even though I had not liked to participate in kneeling before: my emotional immaturity had previously led me to suspect that there was something slave-like in this movement. But now kneeling was not enough. And when my hands lay on the old, thousands of feet-worn rug, some secret door of the soul opened, and tears of incomparable ecstatic joy flowed uncontrollably. And, truth be told, I don't really care how experts in all kinds of ecstasies and admirations will name and classify what happened next. The content of these moments was a rise to Heavenly Russia, experiencing the Synod of its enlightened, otherworldly warmth of spiritual streams pouring from that focal point, which can be justly and accurately called the Heavenly Kremlin. The great spirit, who once walked on our earth in the form of St. Seraphim of Sarov, and now is one of the brightest luminaries of the Russian Synod, approached and bowed to me, covering me, like an epitrahil, with a tent of flowing rays of light and gentle warmth. For almost a year, until this church was closed, I went to the akathists to St. Seraphim every Monday and, amazingly enough, experienced this state every time, again and again, with undiminished strength.

At the beginning of 1943, I participated in the crossing of the 196th Infantry Division across the ice of Lake Ladoga and, after a two-day journey through the Karelian Isthmus, entered the besieged city of Leningrad late in the evening. During the journey through the deserted, dark city to the place where I was stationed, I experienced a state that partly resembled that youthful experience near the Savior Church in its content, but colored very differently: as if bursting through the specific atmosphere of a front-line night, it shone through it, and then absorbed it into itself, it was colored harshly and gloomily. Inside it, there was darkness and a shimmering opposition of irreconcilable principles, and their stunning scales and the gaping great demonic essence behind one of them inspired trembling horror. I saw the third uplift clearer than ever before - and only the shining from the approaching enemy - our hope, our joy, our defender, the great spirit-national leader of our homeland - saved my mind from irreparable breaking^^1.

^^1: I tried to express this experience in the poem "Leningrad Apocalypse," but the laws of art required me to separate the threads of this experience. The opposing images that appeared simultaneously had to be depicted in a chronological sequence, and a number of elements had to be added to the overall picture that, although not contradictory to this experience, were absent in reality. One such productive addition was the bombing of the Engineer Castle (which I did not witness), as well as the concussion of the hero of the poem.

Finally, something similar but completely free from metaphysical horror was experienced by me in September 1949 in Vladimir, again at night, in a small prison cell, while my only comrade slept, and several times later, in 1950-53, also at night, in a common prison cell. The experience gained on this path of knowledge was not enough for the "Rose of the World". But the very movement along this path led me to the point where I was sometimes able to consciously perceive the influence of certain Providential forces, and these hours of spiritual encounters became a more perfect form of meta-historical knowledge than the one I just described.

The relatively common and well-known experience of the etheric body leaving the physical vessel while it rests in deep sleep, and traveling through other layers of planetary space. However, returning to waking consciousness, the traveler does not retain any clear memories of what was seen. They are only stored in the deep memory, completely separated from the consciousness of the vast majority. Deep memory (anatomically, its center is located in the brain) is a repository of memories of the pre-existence of the soul, as well as its trans-physical journeys, similar to the one described. The psychological climate of some cultures and the millennia-old religious-physiological practice directed in this direction, such as in India and Buddhist countries, contributed to the fact that the barrier between deep memory and consciousness weakened. If one abandons cheap skepticism, it is impossible not to notice that it is precisely in these countries that one can often hear, even from very simple people, statements that the realm of pre-existence is not completely closed to their consciousness. In Europe, which was first educated in Christianity, which set this problem aside, and then in irreligious science, nothing contributed to the weakening of the barrier between deep memory and consciousness, except for the individual efforts of rare individuals.

I must say quite frankly that I personally did not make even these efforts, for the simple reason that I did not know how to approach it, and I had no leaders. But there was something else, for which I am probably indebted to the efforts of invisible executors of the Providential will, namely, a certain openness, as if to a narrow gap, of the door between deep memory and consciousness. However unconvincing it may sound to the vast majority, I am not going to hide the fact that weak, fragmentary, but undeniably reliable flashes from deep memory have influenced my life since childhood, intensified in youth, and finally, at the age of forty-seven, illuminated the days of my existence with a new light. This does not mean that the organ of deep memory has been fully revealed - that is still far off - but the significance of the forms emanating from there has become so palpably clear to me, and the images themselves are sometimes so distinct, that the qualitative, essential difference between them and ordinary memories, as well as between them and the work of imagination, becomes undeniable. How can I not bow with gratitude to the fate that brought me into those conditions for a whole decade, which are cursed by almost everyone who has experienced them, and which were not entirely easy for me either, but which, at the same time, served as a powerful means of opening the spiritual organs of my being? It was precisely in prison, with its isolation from the outside world, its unlimited leisure, and its one and a half thousand nights spent by me awake, lying on a bed among sleeping comrades - it was precisely in prison that a new stage of meta-historical and trans-physical cognition began for me. The hours of meta-historical enlightenment became more frequent. The long rows of nights turned into continuous contemplation and reflection. Deep memory began to send ever more distinct images into consciousness, illuminating with new meaning both the events of my personal life and the events of history and modern times. And finally, waking up in the morning after a short but deep sleep, I knew that today the dream was not filled with dreams, but with something entirely different: trans-physical wanderings.

If such wanderings are carried out through demonic layers, and without a guide, and under the influence of dark impulses of one's own soul or the treacherous summons of demonic beings, a person, upon awakening, does not remember anything distinctly but carries with them a compelling, seductive, and pleasantly eerie feeling from the journey. From this feeling, like from poisonous seeds, deeds can grow that will bind the soul to these worlds long after death. Such wanderings happened to me in my youth, and these deeds pulled me along with them, and it was not my merit that the further radiant path of my life on earth led me farther and farther away from these breakdowns into the abyss.

If, however, the descent is made with a guide - one of the brothers of the Synclita country or the Synclita of the World, if it has a providential meaning and purpose, then the traveler, upon awakening and sometimes experiencing the same compelling, tempting feeling, at the same time realizes its temptation, not only that, but in his memories, he finds the opposite of this temptation: an understanding of the ominous meaning of the existence of these worlds and their true face, not a mask. He does not try to return to these lower layers through ethical decline in the plane of his waking life, but makes the acquired experience the object of religious, philosophical, and mystical understanding or even the material of his artistic creations, which have, among other values, an indispensable warning meaning.

At the age of forty-seven, I remembered and understood some of my transphysical wanderings that I had previously made. Before that time, memories of them were of a vague, fragmentary, chaotic nature that did not form any coherent whole. New wanderings often remained in memory as vividly, reliably, and emotionally as the opening of secrets does, as no dream, even the most significant one, remains in memory.

There is an even more perfect form of such journeys through planetary space: the same exit of the etheric body, the same travels with the great leader through the layers of the ascending or descending series, but with full preservation of waking consciousness. Then, upon returning, the traveler brings back memories that are even more certain and exhaustive. This is only possible if the spiritual sense organs are already widely opened and the barriers from deep memory are forever removed. This is true spiritual vision, which of course, I have not experienced.

As far as I know (though I may be mistaken), only Dante among European writers was involved in this. Creating the "Divine Comedy" was his mission. But the full opening of his spiritual sense organs only occurred at the end of his life, when the huge work on the poem was nearing its end. He realized numerous errors, inaccuracies, the lowering of meaning, and excessive anthropomorphism of the images, but there was no time or strength left to correct them. Nevertheless, the system he presented can be accepted in its main features as a panorama of the different material layers of Roman Catholic metaculture.

I dare not even mention anything like this, but I have had the great fortune of conversations with some who have long since left us and now reside in the Synclite of Russia. I can hardly touch on the absolutely stunning experiences of their real closeness with my pen. I cannot even name their names, but the closeness of each of them was colored in an uniquely individual tone of feeling. Meetings occurred during the day, in a crowded prison cell, and I had to lie down on my cot, facing the wall, to hide the flow of tears from overwhelming happiness. The closeness of one of the great brothers caused my heart to beat harder and my soul to tremble with solemn reverence. My entire being greeted another with warm, tender love, like a precious friend who sees through my soul and loves it, offering me forgiveness and comfort. The approach of the third evoked a need to bow before him, like a mighty one who has risen incomparably higher than me, and his closeness was accompanied by a strict sense of attention and unusual acuteness. Finally, the approach of the fourth evoked a feeling of exultant joy - a worldly joy - and tears of ecstasy. I can doubt many things, approach many things in my inner life with suspicion of their authenticity, but not these encounters.

Did I see them themselves during these meetings? No. Did they talk to me? Yes. Did I hear their words? Yes and no. I heard them, but not with my physical hearing. It was as if they were speaking from the depths of my heart.

Many of their words, especially the new names of the different layers of Shadanakar and hierarchies, I repeated before them, trying to convey their sounds as closely as possible to physical speech, and asked: is this correct? Some of the names and names had to be clarified several times; there were also some for which it was not possible to find a more or less accurate reflection in our sounds. Many of these otherworldly words, spoken by the great brothers, were accompanied by light phenomena, but it was not physical light, although in some cases they can be compared to lightning flashes, in others with glowing, and in others with moonlight. Sometimes these were not even words in our sense, but rather whole chords of phonetic harmony and meaning. Such words could not be translated into our language at all, it was necessary to take one from all the meanings - one from all the harmoniously sounding syllables.

But the conversations were not in individual words, but in questions and answers, in whole phrases expressing very complex ideas. Such phrases, without being broken down into words, as if flashed, imprinting themselves on the gray sheet of my consciousness, and illuminated with an extraordinary light that which was dark and unclear for me and which my question concerned. Rather, it was not even phrases, but pure thoughts that were conveyed to me directly, apart from words.

So, the path of meta-historical insights, contemplations, and reflections was supplemented by trans-physical journeys, encounters, and conversations.

The spirit of our time will not hesitate to ask: "While what the author calls experience may be accurate for the experiencing subject, can it have greater objective significance than the 'experience' of a patient in a mental hospital? Where are the guarantees?"

But it is strange: do we approach all phenomena of spiritual life, all cultural phenomena, with a demand for guarantees? And if not all, then why specifically these? After all, we do not demand guarantees of "accuracy" from a painter or composer for their musical inspirations and painterly visions.

There are no guarantees in conveying religious and, in particular, meta-historical experience. Without any guarantees, someone whose spiritual disposition is at least partially attuned to it will believe in the experience of another; they will not believe and will demand guarantees, and if they receive guarantees, it will not matter to someone who is alien to that disposition.

Only science insists on the obligatory acceptance of its own testimonies, forgetting how often its conclusions of today have been overturned by the conclusions of tomorrow. Other areas of the human spirit are free from obligations and internally boundlessly free: art, religion, and meta-history.

However, to mix these areas together, to assume, for example, that the meta-historical form of knowledge is some kind of original and rare variety of artistic creativity, would be the most primitive mistake. They may overlap at certain stages, but a meta-historical cognitive process is possible that is completely free of elements of artistic creativity, and processes of artistic creativity that have nothing to do with meta-history are truly countless.

But even in the realm of religions, only a few varieties have truly enriched themselves with meta-historical knowledge. Interestingly, in the Russian language, the word "откровение" (revelation) is literally equivalent to the Greek "апокалипсис" (apocalypse), but the latter has firmly established itself on Russian soil. At the same time, each of the two words has a special shade of meaning. The meaning of the word "откровение" is more general: if we do not confine ourselves to narrow confessional frameworks, we must include historical cases of revelation, such as the visions and raptures of Muhammad and even the enlightenment of Gautama Buddha. Apocalypse, on the other hand, is only one type of revelation: it is not about the realms of universal harmony, the sphere of absolute fullness, not even about the circle of stellar or other cosmic hierarchies; it is about the revelations of the fate of nations, kingdoms, churches, cultures, humanity, and the hierarchies that most effectively and directly manifest themselves in these fates: the revelation of meta-history. Apocalypse is not as universal as cosmic revelation, it is hierarchically lower, it is about something closer to us. But precisely because of this, it answers the burning queries of destiny, thrown into the crucible of historical cataclysms. It fills the gap between the comprehension of universal harmony and the dissonances of historical and personal existence. As is known, only a few peoples and in a few centuries were rich in this revelation: apocalypticism arose among the Jews, apparently around the 6th century BC, captured early Christianity, and lingered longest in medieval Judaism, feeding on the burning atmosphere of its messianism.

In Christianity, particularly in the Eastern tradition, the apocalyptic form of knowledge was almost completely lost in the early Middle Ages, only to suddenly reemerge in the dim, flickering, smoldering flame of the first century of the Great Russian Schism. It would be inappropriate to delve into the complex and numerous causes of this damage, but it is impossible not to note its connection with the anti-historicism of religious consciousness and the world of religious feelings, which captures our attention as far back as the Byzantine Church Fathers and is even striking in representatives of Russian Orthodoxy, even in the greatest and most spiritually experienced individuals whose righteousness and highest spiritual experience cannot be doubted. Anti-historicism becomes almost a mandatory canon of religious thought. It is instructive to recall the unresolved conflicts between the official anti-historicism of Russian church worldview and the innate, irrational attraction to the apocalyptic form of knowledge, to metahistory, in the spiritual and creative biographies of secular Orthodox writers and thinkers: Gogol, Khomyakov, Leontiev, Dostoevsky, Vladimir Solovyov, and Sergei Bulgakov.

But the consolation is that the touch of metanarrative can be realized in a completely different way than it was discussed here. This is evidenced by the element of metahistorical experience, which can often be found under the enormous thickness of anti-historicism - whether apparent or genuine. The feeling wonderfully conveyed by Tyutchev, when the individual feels like a participant in some historical mystery, a participant in the work and struggle of great spiritual - or rather, transphysical - forces, powerfully manifested in the fateful moments of history - could Joan of Arc have accomplished her feat without this feeling? Could St. Sergius of Radonezh - despite his true anchoretic and ascetic worldview - have taken such a decisive, even guiding part in the political storms of his time? Could the most significant of popes throughout the centuries have attempted the idea of a universal hierocracy, or Loyola have created an organization consciously seeking to master the mechanism of historical development without this feeling? Could Hegel, with his mind alone, have created the "Philosophy of History," or Goethe - the second part of "Faust"? Would the self-immolation of the Old Believers have been imaginable if the icy wind of eschatological, metahistorical terror had not cooled in them every attachment to this world, which had already fallen under the power of the Antichrist, as they believed? The vague metahistorical feeling, not enlightened by contemplation and reflection, often leads to distorted concepts and chaotic actions. Do we not sense some metahistorical pathos in the pompous speeches of the leaders of the French Revolution, in the doctrines of utopian socialism, in the cult of Humanity of Auguste Comte, or in the calls for universal renewal by destroying all established order - calls that take on in the mouth of Bakunin the tone that recalls the passionate appeals of the Jewish prophets, even though the orator of the 19th century invests these appeals with a new, even opposite to the worldview of the ancient prophets, meaning? Hundreds more such questions could be asked. The inevitable answers to them will lead to two important conclusions. First, it will become clear that in the general volume of both Western and Russian culture, the subconscious layer of apocalyptic experiences can be found in an innumerable number of phenomena, even those that at first glance seem foreign to it. And secondly - the meta-historical sense, the meta-historical experience, unconscious, vague, confused, contradictory, is constantly woven into the creative process: artistic, religious, social, and even political.

Speaking about the meta-historical method of cognition, I unconsciously switched to the transphysical one: the travels and encounters that I described partly relate to the areas of transphysical cognition. After all, I have already mentioned that these phenomena cannot always be clearly classified; this would not be necessary at all if we did not want to bring some clarity to a complex and poorly researched series of issues.

Perhaps some may express surprise: why do I use the term "transphysical" so often instead of the commonly understood word "spiritual"? But the word "spiritual" in its strict sense can only be related to God and monads. The term "transphysical," on the other hand, is applied to everything that has materiality but of a different kind than ours, to all the worlds existing in spaces with a different number of coordinates and in other streams of time. I understand by transphysics (in terms of the object of cognition) the totality of such worlds regardless of the processes taking place there. Such processes related to the formation of Shadanakar constitute meta-history; those related to the formation of the Universe constitute meta-evolution; the cognition of meta-evolution is universal cognition. The term "transphysics" in terms of religious doctrine means the doctrine of the structure of Shadanakar. Objects of meta-historical cognition are connected with history and culture, those of transphysical with the nature of our layer and other layers of Shadanakar, and those of universal with the Universe. Thus, the phenomena that I called transphysical travels and encounters can be attributed, depending on their content, either to the meta-historical kind of cognition or to the transphysical or universal kind.

After this brief clarification, nothing prevents us from moving on to the consideration of the two remaining types of religious cognition - but, of course, only in those variants that are personally familiar to me.

### Chapter 2. A little about the transphysical method.

It would seem that people's attitudes towards nature are infinitely diverse, individual, and sometimes internally contradictory. However, if we trace the evolution of this relationship throughout the universal history of culture from the invention of writing to the present day, we can identify several types or, better to say, phases of it. I will allow myself here, in a very simplified way and in the most general terms, to outline three or four very important phases as they appear to me. This is not a true picture of how this relationship has changed in cultures and centuries, but rather a few rough strokes aimed more at introducing the reader to the problem than at creating a historical perspective on the issue.

The earliest phase is characterized by the fact that the cosmos seems extremely small, and Earth is the only inhabited world. However, this world, in addition to our physical layer, has a number of other layers that are also material, but their materiality is of a different nature and properties than ours; the first approximation to the transphysical reality of Shadanakar. All these layers, like ours, are devoid of development. They were created once and for all and are inhabited by good and evil beings. For these beings, humans are the center of their interests and, so to speak, the apple of discord. The human being does not perceive Nature as something outside of him/her and does not oppose himself/herself to it. Individual manifestations of Nature, of course, arouse various feelings - fear, pleasure, awe, but Nature as a whole, apparently, is almost not perceived or perceived only in a purely aesthetic sense, and even then only by some individuals who are highly gifted with artistic sensibility. Therefore, it is rare to find among the monuments of art of these epochs the lyrical poetry of nature and even less so - landscape painting. This phase is mainly associated with ancient cultures, as well as some later cultural forms of the East. In religious terms, polytheism is characteristic of the first phase.

The second phase is characterized by those monotheistic systems that either ignore Nature, showing no interest in it, or are hostile towards it. Personal growth leads to the belief that humans can improve themselves. Nature, on the other hand, shows no signs of development, it is inert and static, amoral and irrational, it is under the control of demonic forces, and the part of the human being that is united with Nature either enslaves it or is enslaved by it. This is the phase of "conquering Nature." Christian, Buddhist, and Hindu nations have gone through this phase; Judaism, as long as it coincided with its national religion, also stopped at this phase. However, Semitic sense of Nature was generally impoverished. It has long been noted how poor the authors of the biblical books and the Quran were in terms of this feeling compared to those who created the great epics of Greece and especially India. Semites paid an inevitable tribute to Nature, endowing the reproduction of the species with religious sanction, but in their spiritual philosophy and art, they tried to ignore it with ambiguous consistency. They made sculpture and portrait painting practically impossible because they were afraid of deifying humans and hated the deification of the elements. Like other elements of Semitism, this tendency to conquer Nature passed to Europe with Christianity, suppressed the natural cults of Germanic and Slavic paganism, and prevailed until the end of the Middle Ages. But the East also had to go through this phase, although it colored it in its own way. The asceticism of extreme manifestations of Brahmanism, the struggle of Buddhism for the liberation of the human self from the power of Nature - all this is too well-known to dwell on. Thus, if in the first phase Nature as a whole was almost not perceived, but was poeticized and deified in its separate manifestations, then in the second phase it was recognized as a hostile beginning, submissive to demonic forces.

The third phase is associated with the era of scientific dominance and the depletion of the world's religious feelings. Inheriting from Christianity a naturalistic principle, the person of the third phase frees it from religious meaning, refuses to overcome natural elements in one's own being, and justifies a strictly utilitarian approach to nature. Nature is an object of rational (scientific) investigation, firstly; it is a conglomeration of soulless forces that must be subdued for human needs, secondly. The physical outlook is infinitely broadened; knowledge of the structure and laws of our layer reaches dizzying depths; this is the value of the third phase. However, it is in vain to talk about the love of nature among naturalists. Intellectual love can only be experienced towards the products of the intellect: one can love an idea, thought, theory, or scientific discipline with their mind. Thus, one can love physiology, microbiology, even parasitology, but not lymph, bacteria, and fleas. Love for nature can be a phenomenon of physiological order, aesthetic order, finally - ethical and religious order. It cannot be only one kind of order: intellectual. If individual naturalists love nature, then this feeling has no connection with either their specialty or generally with the scientific methodology of the knowledge of Nature: this feeling is of a physiological or aesthetic order. However, civilized (at least Western) humanity achieved the greatest opposition to Nature not in the 20th century, as it might seem, but in the 17th, 18th, and early 19th centuries. Fashions have never been as artificial as in the era of powdered wigs. Nearby areas of Nature have never been deformed so rationally and unnaturally as in the era of the Versailles park. The aristocrats of the time of the Ludovicians cannot imagine taking a sunbath or walking barefoot, just as it is impossible to imagine a Spartan woman of the Greco-Persian wars wearing a corset and high-heeled shoes. All of this manifested an attitude towards Nature that genetically rooted in Christian asceticism but replaced spiritual snobbery with civilization snobbery, religious pride with pride of reason, and, in general, not marked with the stamp of rationality, did not experience anything except mocking contempt.

Rousseau's philosophy represents a turning point. However, it took a century and the world had to enter the era of giant cities for the longing for nature to become understandable to the majority of people. Poets of the Lake School in England, Goethe and the Romantics in Germany, Pushkin and especially Lermontov in Russia loved nature with a high aesthetic and sometimes pantheistic love. The Barbizon School of painting emerged, and by the end of the 19th century, aesthetic love had won an unshakable right to existence in culture. In the 20th century, physiological love also developed. Visual contemplation of nature became insufficient: there was a need to feel the elements tangibly and motorically, with the whole surface of the body and the movement of muscles. This need was partly met by tourism and sports, and finally, in the first half of our century, the beach, with its physiological dissolution of man in sunlight, warmth, water, play, tightly and firmly entered into everyday life. That same beach, which in the time of Ronsard or Watteau would have seemed like a shameless act of madmen, and in the Middle Ages would have been equated with the witch's sabbaths on Bald Mountain and, perhaps, the black mass. If we imagine Torquemada, suddenly transported as a spectator to the beach in Ostend or Yalta, there can be little doubt that the thought of an immediate auto-da-fé of thousands of these shameless heretics would immediately arise in the mind of this guardian of human souls.

Perhaps nothing illustrates the decreasing gap between humans and the elements over the last century as vividly as the evolution of clothing.

Coats and headwear, which were once a constant presence even on a hot summer day for the "cultured" person, are now only worn as needed for the climate. Fifty years ago, it seemed indecent to leave the house without gloves, but now they are only used in cold weather. Instead of frock coats and starched cuffs, which our grandfathers wore even in thirty-degree heat, life is now being conquered with sleeveless tops and open collars. Feet, once cramped in high boots, now appreciate the comfort of slippers and sandals. Women have been freed from the nightmare of corsets and wear short and open dresses in the summer, while long dresses survive only as evening attire. Children, whose great-grandfathers at a corresponding age solemnly walked in gymnasium jackets and with a kepi on their heads, now run barefoot, in only their shorts, kissed black by the sun. The human of the global city, who has distanced themselves from Nature like never before, yearns for her "hot embrace" and returns to her, almost unconsciously, with instinctive bodily love, but carrying the seeds of a new, more perfect relationship with Nature in the accumulated historical experience of their soul. This is the fourth phase.

So, there are four phases: pagan, ascetic, scientific-utilitarian, and instinctive-physiological.

Here's the English translation:

One can summarize as follows: by the second half of our century, two attitudes towards nature had become established in the educated and semi-educated layers of the nation belonging to the Roman Catholic, German Protestant, and Russian cultural zones, which hardly contradicted each other. One was the old utilitarian-economic-scientific attitude, completely alien to love. It focused on the use of natural resources and measured everything by the criterion of material benefit for humanity or, worse still, for some of its antagonistic parts; from this point of view, it also approves of sports, the beach, and tourism. Supporters of this attitude, out of interest in "how it works?" will calmly cut open live cats and dogs, and lurk for hares and grouse to satisfy their atavistic hunting instincts. Perhaps in the first case, love for humanity is also meant: because from the dog corpses of Mont Blanc, finally a morsel of knowledge is extracted, such as conditioned reflexes; this enlightens the thirsty mind and moves medicine forward. But there is not even a shadow of love for nature here. Moreover, such an attitude towards nature is immoral because no interests of living beings other than humans are taken into account, and because the entire nature is viewed as a milk cow. Fortunately, this attitude is beginning to soften - a newer one: unconsciously-selfish-physiological love for nature, sometimes complicated by aesthetics. But this development has not yet led to the realization that it is possible and necessary to enrich this relationship with ethical and religious meaning, while maintaining old shades of love for nature, except of course for the amoral-utility attitude towards it. Not pantheistic, when a person only vaguely senses the presence of some impersonal, evenly distributed divine power in nature - no. This has already been, and primitive animism is proof that the pantheistic feeling of civilized people is nothing more than the transformation of the oldest experience of arungvility-prana. No! What we have here is something else. What we have here is an incomparably more moral and conscious, clearer, more developed and sophisticated, more joyful, more active attitude. It can only be based on that experience when a person directly feels the richest and most diverse worlds of elementals through nature. She feels - that is, she engages in communication, understanding more and more the possibilities of a happy and creative friendship with them, the beauty of our duty before them, and the bitter, ancient guilt we carry.

Truth be told, a vague sense of guilt towards Nature, particularly towards animals, began to take effect. Societies for the protection of animals emerged, love for them was encouraged even in school pedagogy, and the protection of greenery was taken on by such a renowned source of love as the state. Unfortunately, in doing so, it was only based on the consideration of economic benefit. As for the protection of animals, benefactors received a harsh lesson from natural scientists: after heated discussions, vivisection systematically took its place in science as one of the leading methods. Justifying themselves with the benefit for humanity, this shame of humanity firmly established itself in universities, laboratories, and even in the very middle school that teaches children to love cats and dogs.

What would be the attitude towards Nature from the worldview that could form the basis of the teaching of the Rose of the World?

The question is very broad; however, it is easy, I think, to conclude what the main characteristic of this relationship will be. After all, the perception of the Rose of the World is characterized primarily by the feeling of transparency of the physical layer, the experience of the layers of transphysics shining through it, a passionate love for this experience, and its careful cultivation. This feeling covers the sphere of culture and history - and is reflected in the meta-historical teaching; it turns to the Sun, Moon, and the starry sky - and becomes the basis of the teaching of the universal, that is, the meta-evolutionary; it encompasses the earthly nature - and finds its expression in the teaching of the elementals. The teaching of the elementals, in turn, turns out to be a branch of a more general teaching about the structure of Shadanakar - the teaching of transphysicality.

No matter how much ancient beliefs about elementals (spirits of the elements in the broadest sense) were muddied by the side effects introduced by the limitations of human imagination and understanding, no matter how much aberrations distorted the images of natural deities in the pantheons of polytheistic religions, the truth lies at the very foundation of these beliefs.

However, of course, we must comprehend and revere the worlds of elementals in a completely different way than it was possible for ancient peoples. The experience of subsequent stages has enriched us, expanded our knowledge, and sharpened mystical thought.

The main differences between our belief in elementals and the belief of the ancients are as follows. The ancients anthropomorphized their ideas about elemental deities; we no longer feel the need to give elementals a human-like image. The ancients viewed these worlds as something forever given and unchanging; we are aware of their evolution, although it is not similar to the evolution of our organic world, and we will strive to understand its paths.

The ancients could experience a connection with individual layers of elementals, but they indistinctly distinguished them from each other, and they did not even have a guess about the ways of the monads' development. In fact, they did not have a clear idea of the plurality of these layers. For us, the plurality and interconnection of these layers and the paths of development of the monads living there become the object of transphysical knowledge.

The ancients were unable to depict a general picture of the planetary cosmos; we much more clearly differentiate each layer and include it with all its specific features in the overall panorama of Shadanakar.

The ancients could not reconcile their belief in these worlds with the belief in the One; for us, there is no contradiction between these two beliefs.

And it should be added that the ancients saw their spiritual obligations towards elementals in appeasing and praising them - and that's it; we will strive to establish our connection with them by being ready to participate in their games and creativity, by attracting their benevolent participation in our lives - the possible ways to achieve this will be shown in the relevant chapters - and, finally, in our own assistance to the bright elementals and in working towards the enlightenment of the dark ones.

This attitude towards Nature combines pagan joy of life, monotheistic spirituality, and the breadth of knowledge of the scientific era, embodying all these elements into a higher unity through personal spiritual experience of the emerging religion's outcome.

There is a widespread misconception that any religious worldview is hostile to life, replacing all the values of our world with the values of other worlds. Such a generalization is no more valid than, for example, the claim that painting art takes one away from the world, based on the fact that this was partly true in the Middle Ages. The creed of a certain phase of religion may be hostile to life, but only in its extreme manifestations. The same worldview I am talking about does not take one away from the world but teaches to love it with passionate and selfless love. It does not oppose "other worlds" to this world but perceives them all as a magnificent whole, like a necklace on the chest of God. Do we like a crystal lamp less because it is transparent? Will we love our world less because other worlds shine through it? For a person who feels this way, this life is good, and death can be not an enemy but a kind guide if a life well-lived on Earth determines the transition to other worlds that are no less, but even more rich and beautiful.

But how is this permeating worldview achieved by a human being? Does it come independently of our will, like a lucky gift of fate, or can it be consciously cultivated in ourselves and in whole generations?

As long as the combined efforts of many people are not directed towards such cultivation, the joy of a permeating worldview remains, indeed, a mercy of God, and we almost do not expend any effort to obtain it. Only through the long labor of our invisible heart friends, the carriers of the Providential will, do the organs of such perception open up in someone, and more often, they only partially open to a narrow slit. But even such partial openness is enough to start the permeation of the physical world and to make the one who is blessed by it resemble a blind person who can suddenly see.

It is hardly possible to initiate this process arbitrarily, whether in oneself or in others, at least not now. However, we can work in this direction so that in each of us or our children, this labor goes towards the work of providential forces, so that in the psycho-physical layers, a tunnel seems to break through simultaneously from both sides: us and our heart's friends.

The colossal task of such pedagogy can only be predicted as one of the tasks of a future cultural era. There is still a huge preliminary work needed to study and systematize experience. I will elaborate on this in more detail in one of the last parts of the book. For now, I will only provide a few necessary pieces of information about two or three possible variations of this methodology. These and many other variations, not mentioned here, can, of course, be combined and assist each other.

There is one preliminary condition without which no efforts in this direction would lead to anything. This is a person's readiness to achieve the merging of that crystalline vessel, which we call Nature. Therefore, this process is accessible only to those who allow for the possibility of the existence of elemental worlds (without this, one can wish for the merging of the physical layer, but only, on the contrary, so that nothing comes of it, in order to triumph over my scientific skepticism). Or for children, if trust in the elements and love for Nature are strengthened from an early age by elders. Naturally, those who deny the existence of these worlds will not spend time and effort on such experiments. And even if, as an experiment, they decided to make some efforts, they would not achieve anything because their own mistrust would constantly spread to the results obtained, and they would attribute these results to self-hypnosis or something similar. Taking a step forward is taking a step back. Stuck in place.

So, if the necessary internal condition is present, it is necessary to take care of creating the necessary external conditions. It is easy to guess that we are talking about such periods (one and a half to two months a year) when a modern person, freed from work for the sake of their livelihood, can afford to be alone in nature. It seems to me that the conditions are more favorable in the summer, because it is precisely in the summer, with the high position of the sun, the development of vegetation, and the exposure of the earth's surface and water spaces, that the activity of the elements is multiplied many times over by the participation of new and new layers of them. Not to mention the fact that city dwellers usually go on vacation in the summer, that is, they have the opportunity to communicate with nature for at least a month. Although, it must be said directly, a month is not enough to make much progress, and attempting such efforts in two-week vacations is completely useless. I should also note that for some of us, winter nature is individually closer, and in such cases, of course, one should take this predisposition into account.

Perhaps someone is expecting precise instructions from me, like getting up at a certain time, going to bed at a certain time, adhering to a certain daily routine. I would prefer to avoid such trivial recommendations. What is the task? To enter deeper into nature, into the life of the elements, and to do so not as a destroyer or a curious experimenter, but as a son returning home after many years of wandering in a foreign land. To solve such a task, what is natural and useful for one individual may not be so for another. I would only like to share what conditions have personally helped me.

Choosing a beautiful and, of course, sparsely populated place as a "base" for this time, it was necessary, first of all, to avoid cluttering the soul and mind with petty worldly concerns. It was necessary to weaken ties with the big city, use the radio less frequently, and try to do without newspapers as much as possible, unless, of course, the world was in a state of extreme unrest. It was necessary to simplify one's life, make clothes as light as possible, and forget about the existence of shoes altogether. Bathing two or three times a day in a river, lake, or sea, finding a place where you could be alone with nature for this time. Read books that promote peaceful, friendly moods and sometimes help your thoughts immerse themselves in the depths of nature; scientific literature cannot be useful in such days, as it sets a completely different tone: it further leads one away from the exact sciences and technology. It is better to read good poetry, some classics of literature: Turgenev, Dickens, Erckmann-Chatrian, Tagore (but, of course, not such writers as Stendhal, Zola, Swift or Shchedrin). It is good to reread classic children's literature at this time, such as "Tom Sawyer" or "Children of Captain Grant," and literature about children. And frequent communication, games, and conversations with children at this time can only help. Perhaps I will scare some off with one instruction, but unfortunately, it is absolutely firm: to minimize meat and fish consumption and to refrain from abundant wine consumption. And - an absolutely unconditional requirement: that there be no hunting or fishing whatsoever.

In such an atmosphere, journeys began: it's hard to call them "walks" or "excursions." These were whole-day escapes, from dawn to dusk, or for three or four days with overnight stays in the woods, wandering along country roads and field paths, through meadows, forestry, villages, farms, slow river crossings, chance encounters, and casual conversations, with overnight stays - by a campfire by the river, in a clearing, in a haystack, or somewhere on a rural hayloft. I actively avoided proximity to cars, technical conversations, and reading similar literature, except occasionally using mechanical transport. Then, I would return to my secluded "base," rest for a few days, listen to the crowing of roosters, rustling of leaves, and voices of children and hosts, read peaceful, deep, and frequent books, and set off again on such wandering. This lifestyle may sometimes cause confusion or teasing; understanding is not expected, and people occupied with rural work may even see such a strange person as an idle wanderer. Most peasants, for now, only know how to consider their own work as essential. This should not be disturbing. You must be able to disregard other people's opinions if you feel you are right. But all of these are instructions on the external. You can roam the woods and fields all summer to exhaustion, but return with nothing. External conditions must be supplemented with some mental and emotional efforts. What are they?

In gradually getting used to perceiving the noise of the forest ocean, the swaying of grass, the flow of clouds and rivers, all the voices and movements of the visible world as living, deeply meaningful, and friendly to it, the feeling that invariably reigns over the change of other thoughts and feelings will intensify, as if, leaning backwards, you lower your head lower and lower into the flickering, softly-lit, rocking depth - eternal, loving, and native. The feeling of clear joy, wise tranquility will absorb the slightest splash of fuss; it is good on such days to lie, without counting time, on the riverbank and aimlessly watch the cool water sparkling in the sun. Or, lying somewhere in the midst of an old pine forest, listening to the organ-like sound of the treetops and the tapping of the woodpecker. You have to trust that the poetry of the Liurna is already rejoicing in you and will speak to your body as soon as it descends into their flowing flesh; that the poetry of the Fal'tory or Arashamfa is already singing you songs of rustling leaves, buzzing bees, and warm air currents. When you return home at sunset through the flood meadows smelling of freshly cut hay, climbing up the warm air of hills and descending into cool valleys, and the quiet fog begins to flood everything except the tops of the haystacks, it's good to take off your shirt and let the hot body be caressed by this fog, which is created by those who weave it over the sleepy meadows. There could be hundreds more of such moments - from sunbathing on the sand to picking berries - semi-action, semi-contemplation, but those who embark on this easy and light path will guess them without guidance. After all, such a lifestyle is possible not only in Central Russia but also in the natural landscape of any other country, from Norway to Ethiopia, from Portugal to the Philippines and Argentina. Accordingly, only details will change, but they can also change within the same landscape according to personal inclinations. The main thing is to create this lightness and light within oneself and repeat similar periods, if possible, every year.

"What absurdity," some will think. "As if we do not have exhaustive data on the origin of fogs, winds, dew, and the mechanics of rain, rivers, and vegetation. And such fairy tales are presented with a serious face in the middle of the 20th century! No wonder the author hints that it is easier for him to explain to children: a mature person should not listen to such tales.

These absolutists of the scientific method of cognition are mistaken: there is no slightest contradiction to science here. I emphasize: to science, objective and serious, not to the philosophical doctrine of materialism.

After all, if there were some reasonable microscopic creature studying my body and everything entering it, it would have a basis for saying, at the moment when I moved my hand, that this mass of matter consisting of such-and-such molecules jerked because some of its parts contracted - the muscles. And they contracted because such-and-such a reaction occurred in the motor centers, and the reaction was caused by such-and-such causes of a chemical nature. That's it! Clear as day. And, of course, such an interpreter would be outraged if anyone dared to suggest that the "mass" moved because it was the desire of its owner, a free, conscious desire, and that the muscles, nerves, chemical processes, and so on were only a transmission mechanism of his will.

Physiology studies this mechanism. This does not prevent the existence of psychology - the science of that consciousness that uses this mechanism.

Meteorology, aerodynamics, hydrology, and a number of other sciences study the elements of nature as mechanisms. This should not and will not prevent the emergence over time of a doctrine of elementals - those consciousnesses that use these mechanisms."

Personally, everything started for me on a hot summer day in 1929 near the town of Tripolye in Ukraine. Happily tired from a long walk through open fields and hills with windmills, where there was a vast view of the bright blue arms of the Dnieper River and the sandy islands between them, I climbed to the crest of another hill and suddenly I was literally blinded: before me, motionless under the waterfall of sunlight, there stretched an immense sea of sunflowers. At that same moment, I felt as though an invisible sea of exultant, living happiness was quivering above this splendor. I stepped to the edge of the field and, with a pounding heart, pressed two rough sunflowers against both my cheeks. I looked ahead at these thousands of earthly suns, almost suffocating with love for them and for those whose joy I felt above this field. I felt something strange: I felt as though these invisible beings were joyfully and proudly leading me, as a dear guest, almost to their own amazing celebration, reminiscent of a mystery and a feast. I cautiously took two steps into the thick of the plants and, closing my eyes, listened to their touch, their barely audible ringing rustle, and the divine warmth everywhere. That's how it started. True, I remember experiences of this kind related to earlier years, of childhood and adolescence, but they were not yet so gripping then. However, both before and after that moment, not every year, but sometimes several times in one summer, there were moments of strange, intoxicating joy among nature. They mainly occurred when hundreds of miles had been left behind, walking, and when I unexpectedly found myself in unfamiliar places marked by lush and riotous vegetation. Completely overwhelmed with delight and trembling, I pushed my way through wild thickets, sun-soaked swamps, and whipping bushes, and finally threw myself into the grass to feel it all over my body. The main thing was that during those moments, I distinctly felt how the invisible beings whose existence is mysteriously linked to this vegetation, water, and soil loved me and flowed through me. In the following years, I spent most of my summers in the area of the Bryansk forests, and a lot happened to me there, the memory of which brings joy to my life. But I especially love to remember my encounters with the elementals of Liurna - those whom I then mentally called the souls of rivers.

Once I went on a solo journey through the forests of Bryansk for a week. There was a drought, and the forest fires had left a haze of bluish fibers, with white, slowly shifting smoke rising above the pine groves. For many hours, I had to trudge along a hot, sandy road without encountering any sources of water. The oppressive heat, like that of a greenhouse, caused a tiresome thirst. I had a detailed map of the area with me, and I knew that I would soon come across a small stream, so small that it was not even marked on the map. And indeed, the character of the forest began to change, with the pines giving way to maples and alders. Suddenly, the scorching road, which burned my feet, slid downwards, and ahead I saw the green meadow, and, rounding a pile of trees, I caught sight of the long-awaited stream: the road crossed it ford. What a pearl of the universe, what a delightful child of God laughed at me! A few steps wide, completely covered by the low-hanging branches of old willows and alders, it flowed as if through green caves, playing with myriad sunbeams and murmuring barely audibly.

Throwing my heavy backpack onto the grass and hastily shedding my clothes, I waded into the water up to my chest. And when my hot body plunged into this cool moisture, and the sway of shadows and sunlight quivered on my shoulders and face, I felt that some invisible entity, woven from who knows what, enveloped my soul with such sinless joy, with such laughing cheerfulness, as if it had loved me for a long time and had long waited for me. It was all like the finest soul of this river, all flowing, all quivering, all caressing, all consisting of coolness and light, carefree laughter and tenderness, joy and love. And when, after a long stay of my body in its body, and my soul in its soul, I lay down, closing my eyes, on the shore under the shade of spreading trees, I felt that my heart was so refreshed, so cleansed, so pure, so blissful, as it could have been in the early days of creation, at the dawn of time. And I understood that what had happened to me was not just an ordinary swim, but a real washing in the highest sense of the word.

Perhaps someone would say that they too lived in the forests and swam in the rivers, and wandered through the woods and fields, and stood on the lek of a capercaillie, experiencing a sense of unity with nature, but yet they did not feel anything resembling stihii. If a hunter were to say this, there would be no cause for surprise: stihii are seen by nature destroyers as enemies and polluters, and there is no surer way to make their closeness impossible than to bring a hunting rifle into the woods. If, however, this is said by someone who is not a hunter, let him recall with care the weeks of his life spent in nature, and he will discover his own violations of the conditions I warned about from the very beginning.

Of course, the duration of these stages of knowledge cannot be determined in advance: the time frame depends on many objective and personal circumstances. But sooner or later, the first day will come: suddenly you will feel all of Nature as if it were the first day of creation, and the earth will revel in its heavenly beauty. This can happen at night by a fire, or during the day in a rye field, in the evening on warm porch steps, or in the morning on a dewy meadow, but the content of this hour will be the same everywhere: a dizzying joy of the first cosmic insight. No, this does not yet mean that inner vision has opened up: you will not yet see anything other than the familiar landscape, but you will experience its multi-layered and spiritually saturated essence with your entire being. For those who have passed through this first insight, stihii will become even more accessible; they will increasingly hear the everyday closeness of these wonderful beings with some unnamed abilities of the soul. But the essence of the "first insight" is already in something higher, which I have not been able to find another name for besides the old word "universal". This type of state has been illuminated by many authors in specialized literature. William James calls it a breakthrough of cosmic consciousness. Apparently, it can have very different shades in different people, but the experience of cosmic harmony remains its essence. The method I have described in this chapter is capable of bringing this moment closer to some extent, but one should not hope that such joys will become frequent visitors to the home of our soul. On the other hand, this state can envelop the soul without any conscious preparation: for example, Rabindranath Tagore describes such a case in his "Reminiscences".

It can easily happen that a person who has experienced a sense of universal harmony in nature will think that this is what I am talking about. Oh no. The breakthrough of cosmic consciousness is an event of colossal subjective significance, which can be very limited in the life of one person. It comes suddenly. This is not a mood, not pleasure, not happiness, it is even more than that. The stunning effect will not be its own, but rather the memory of it; itself is filled with such bliss that it is more correct to speak in connection with it not about shock, but about enlightenment.

This state consists of the fact that the Universe is not just the Earth, but the Universe itself opens up in its highest plane, in that divine spirituality that permeates and encompasses it, removing all painful questions about suffering, struggle, and evil.

In my life, this occurred on the night of the full moon on July 29, 1931, in the same Bryansk forests, on the bank of the small river Nerussa. Usually, I try to be alone in nature, but this time it so happened that I took part in a small group excursion. There were several of us - teenagers and young people, including a budding artist. Each had a knapsack with supplies, and the artist also had a travel album for sketches. No one was wearing anything except a shirt and pants, and some even took off their shirts. We walked silently and quickly, like the way African natives walk on animal trails, not hunters, not scouts, not seekers of useful minerals, but simply friends who wanted to spend the night by the fire on the famous Nerussa glades.

The vast pine forest, like the sea, was replaced by a black forest, as always in the Bryansk forests along the river valleys. There were ancient oaks, maples, and ashes that surprised with their slimness and height, as well as birches resembling palms with crowns at dizzying heights; at the very water's edge, the round tents of kind-hearted willows shone, hanging over the backwaters. The forest approached the river with loving caution: with individual groups, clearings, and meadows. There were no villages or forestry... The emptiness was only disturbed by our barely noticeable path, left by the mowers, and by the rounded cones of haystacks that stood out in some places among the clearings, waiting for winter, when they will be taken to Chukhraji or Neporen by sleigh.

We reached the clearing in the evening hours of a hot, cloudless day. After a long swim, we collected firewood and, having made a fire two meters away from the quietly flowing river and sheltered by the shade of three old willows, we prepared a simple dinner. It was getting dark. From behind the oaks emerged a low July moon, completely full. Little by little, the conversations and stories quieted down, and one by one my companions fell asleep around the crackling fire, while I remained awake, swaying a wide branch to protect myself from the mosquitoes.

And when the moon entered the circle of my vision, silently moving behind the intricately narrow leaves of the spreading willow branches, those hours began that remain among the most beautiful of my life. Breathing quietly, lying flat on a pile of hay, I heard how Nerussa flowed not behind me, a few steps away, but as if through my own soul. This was the first extraordinary experience. Triumphantly and silently, everything that was on earth and everything that could be in heaven flowed into the stream that flowed through me, and everything I could think of or imagine was encompassed in a jubilant unity. These ancient forests and transparent rivers, people sleeping by fires, and other people - nations of nearby and faraway lands, morning cities and noisy streets, temples with sacred images, seas that incessantly sway, and steppes with swaying grass - truly everything was in me that night, and I was in everything. I lay with my eyes closed. And beautiful, not at all like what we usually see, white stars, large and blooming, also floated with the world river, like white water lilies. Although the sun was not visible, it seemed as if it, too, flowed somewhere close to my circle of vision. But it was not with its radiance, but with a different light, never before seen by me, that all of this was permeated - everything that flowed through me and at the same time rocked me like a child in a cradle, with an all-soothing love.

Trying to express feelings like this, you see more clearly than ever the poverty of language. How many times have I tried, through poetry and prose, to convey to others what happened to me that night. And I know that any attempt, including this one, will never make another person understand the true meaning of this event in my life, nor its scope, nor its depth.

Later, I tried with all my might to relive that experience. I recreated all the external conditions under which it happened in 1931. Many times in subsequent years, I slept in the exact same place, on the same kind of nights. It was all in vain. It only came back to me so suddenly, twenty years later, not on a moonlit night on a forest river, but in a prison cell.

Oh, this is just the beginning. This is not the enlightenment after which a person becomes, as it were, different, new - enlightened in the highest sense in which this word is understood by the great peoples of the East. That enlightenment is the most sacred and mysterious: it is the revelation of spiritual eyes.

There is no greater happiness on Earth than the full opening of internal vision, hearing, and deep memory. The happiness of a deaf and blind person who suddenly experiences the opening of physical vision and hearing in mature years is only a dim shadow.

I can only repeat, so to speak, what I have heard. There is a wonderful page in Edwin Arnold's poem "The Light of Asia," which describes the state that made one seeker, now known to all humanity as Gautama Buddha.

Here is the description.

It refers to Buddha's entry into the state of "abhijna" - a broad insight "into spheres that have no names, into countless systems of worlds and suns moving with astonishing regularity, myriad after myriad ... where each luminary is an independent whole and at the same time a part of the whole - one of the silvery islands in the sapphire sea, rising in endless aspiration for change. He saw the Lords of Light who hold the worlds with invisible bonds, and themselves meekly move around more powerful luminaries, moving from star to star and casting constant radiance of life from eternally changing centers to the very limits of space. He saw all this in clear images, all cycles and epicycles, the whole series of kalpas and mahakalpas^^1 - to the limit of time that no one can grasp with their mind. Sakual upon sakual^^2, he penetrated into the depth and height and saw beyond all spheres, all forms, all luminaries, every source of movement. That immutable and silently acting Great One, according to Whom darkness must develop into light, death into life, emptiness into fullness, formlessness into form, good into something better, something better into perfection; this unspeakable Great One is stronger than the gods themselves: It is immutable, inexpressible, and supreme. This is the creative, destructive, and recreating power, directing everything to good, beauty, and truth."

What do you say to this? To hope, even in the most secret corner of the soul, that someday such an hour will come upon you too, would not be pride, but simple childishness. And yet, the comfort in knowing that every human monad, without exception, sooner or later, even after almost infinite time, may reach this state, perhaps in a completely different, non-human form, in another world, surpass it, and leave it behind.

And our task is to share with others the best that we have. My best is what I experienced on the paths of transphysical and meta-historical knowledge. This book is written about that. In the last two chapters, I showed how I was able to reach the most important milestones on my inner journey. All further writing will be an exposition of what was understood on this path about God, other worlds, and humanity. I will try not to return to the question of how it was understood; it is time to talk about what was understood.

### Chapter 3. Original Concept

#### Multilayeredness

Our physical layer, which is conceptually equivalent to the astronomical Universe, is characterized, as is known, by having three coordinates in Space and one coordinate in Time, in which it exists. In the terminology of the Rose of the World, this physical layer is called Enrof.

In the arena of modern science and philosophy, the debate over the infinity or finiteness of Enrof in space, its eternity or temporal limitations, and whether Enrof encompasses the entire universe, and whether all forms of existence are exhausted by its forms, is still ongoing.

The discovery of the concept of antimatter, the emergence of physically material particles from physical emptiness, and even their artificial extraction from it, which had hitherto existed in the world of negative energy, as well as the experimental confirmation of the theory indicating that the physical emptiness of Enrof is filled with an ocean of particles of another materiality - all these facts are milestones on the path that slow-moving science follows from the classical materialism to those which are very different from them, and from the positions of the old idealistic philosophy. It is very likely that the confusion that supporters of materialistic philosophy introduce into this problem, claiming that all its opponents only repeat the old ideas of idealism, is one of the tactics in the last battle that materialistic consciousness gives before retreating, as they say, to the brakes, surrendering one of their positions after another and insisting at the same time that this was precisely what the classics of materialism had foreseen and long proclaimed. In particular, it will be very interesting to see what maneuvers this philosophy will resort to in the near future when it will have to introduce the concept of antimatter into the circle of its concepts under the pressure of facts.

Primacy of matter over consciousness, the fundamental comprehensibility of the entire universe and at the same time its infinity and eternity - these naive theses of materialism, developed in past stages of science, can still be held in circulation only through strained tensions, and most importantly - thanks to the intervention of forces related not so much to philosophy as to the police system. However, many of the theses of classical religions do not stand up to the scrutiny of modern science to the same extent. On the other hand, the new knowledge, meta-historical and trans-physical, while not covering the field of scientific knowledge, essentially does not contradict science in anything, and in some questions anticipates its conclusions.

The concept of the multi-layeredness of the Universe is at the heart of the concept of the Rose of the World. Under each layer is understood a material world, the materiality of which is different from others either by the number of spatial or temporal coordinates. Next to us, for example, there exist adjacent layers, the Space of which is measured by the same three coordinates, but the Time of which has not one, as we have, but several dimensions. This means that in such layers Time flows in several parallel streams of different rates. An event in such a layer occurs synchronously in all its temporal dimensions, but the center of the event is in this or two of them. It is certainly not easy to imagine this. The inhabitants of such a layer, although they act primarily in one or two temporal dimensions, exist in all of them and are aware of them all. This synchronicity of being gives a special sense of the fullness of life, unknown to us. Slightly ahead of the course of the exposition, I will add now that a large number of temporal coordinates in combination with a minimum (one, two) number of spatial ones becomes for the inhabitants of such layers, on the contrary, a source of suffering. This is similar to the awareness of the limitation of one's means, with a burning sense of powerless anger, with a memory of tempting opportunities that the subject is unable to take advantage of. A similar state in Enrof some of us would call "biting elbows" or the torment of Tantalus.

With rare exceptions, such as Enrof, the number of temporal dimensions exceeds, by far, the number of spatial dimensions. In Shadanakar, there appear to be no layers with more than six spatial dimensions. However, in the higher layers of these worlds, the number of temporal dimensions reaches a huge figure - two hundred and thirty-six.

It would be wrong to assume that the specific features of Enrof apply to other layers, as if all barriers separating one layer from another are necessarily as impermeable as those separating Enrof from layers of other dimensions. There are barriers that restrict access to a single layer and are even less penetrable, isolating it more densely from the rest. However, there are very few of them. There are many more groups of layers where transition from one layer to another requires the being only special internal conditions and not death or the most difficult material transformation, as with us. There are also those where transition to neighboring layers requires no more effort than, say, moving from one earthly state of Enrof to another. Several such layers make up a system. I am used to mentally calling each such system of layers or series of worlds an Indian term sakuala. However, there are also single layers, like Enrof.

Layers and entire sakualas differ from each other in the nature of the extent of their space. Not all of them have the cosmic extent that Enrof has. As difficult as it may be to imagine, the space of many of them fades at the boundaries of the solar system. Others are even more local: they are, as it were, confined within the limits of our planet. There are even many that are not associated with the planet as a whole, but only with some of its physical layers or sections. There is nothing resembling the sky in these layers, of course.

Being connected to each other by common meta-historical processes, and possessing, for the most part, a pair of opposing spiritual poles, all layers of each celestial body constitute a vast, closely interacting system. I have already mentioned that such systems are called bramfaturas. The total number of layers in some of them is limited to a few, while others have several hundred. In addition to Shadanakar, whose total number of layers is now 242, there are now bramfaturas of the Sun, Jupiter, Saturn, Uranus, Neptune, the Moon, and some of the large planets' satellites in the solar system. The bramfatura of Venus is in its infancy. The other planets and satellites are as dead in their other layers as they are in Enrof. These are the ruins of the extinct bramfaturas, abandoned by all monads, or never having been bramfaturas at all.
Multilayered material systems, to some extent similar to bramfaturas but incomparably more colossal, encompass some star groups, for example, most of the stars of Orion or the double system with many planets, the Antares stars: even more colossal are the systems of galaxies and the entire Universe. These are macro-bramfaturas. It is known that there are macro-bramfaturas with a huge number of different material layers - up to eight thousand. There is nothing resembling the extreme material rarity, the so-called "void" of Enrof, in macro-bramfaturas.

It is easy to understand that the macrocosms are beyond the reach of even the greatest human souls currently inhabiting Enrof. Without any concrete information, only distant premonitions can be directly gleaned about them. Such information sometimes reaches us from the high spirits of Shadanakar, immeasurably greater than us, through the intermediaries of invisible friends of our hearts. But even such messages are extremely difficult for our perception. For example, it was almost impossible for me to understand the strange and mournful news that there is a material layer in the macrocosms of our galaxy where there is space but no time - something like a hole in time, but with its own movement. This is the suffering of great demons, the kingdom of dark eternity, but not in the sense of endless time, but in the sense of the absence of any time. Such eternity^^1 is not absolute, because time can arise there, and this is one of the tasks of the huge cycles of cosmic formation. This is because only the emergence of time will make it possible to free the great sufferers trapped there.

____________
^^1: I would like to note in passing that the difference between the two meanings of the word "eternity" is still very little understood by our philosophical thought.

Molecules and some types of atoms are part of tiny systems - microcosms, some of which have an incredibly short existence in time. However, these are quite complex worlds, and it should not be overlooked that elementary particles are living beings, and some of them have free will and are quite rational. But communication with them, and even more so personal penetration into microcosms, is practically impossible. There is currently no being in any of the layers of Shadanakar capable of this - it still exceeds even the power of the Planetary Logos. Only in the macrocosms of the Galaxy do spirits of such unimaginable power and greatness act that they are able to simultaneously descend into a multitude of microcosms: for this, such a spirit must, while maintaining its unity, simultaneously embody itself in millions of these tiniest worlds, manifesting itself in each of them with complete completeness, albeit in infinitely small units of time.

I am always talking about, in one way or another, material layers because there are no spiritual layers as such. The difference between spirit and matter is more of a stage than a principle, although spirit is created only by God, emanating from Him, while materiality is created by monads.

In its primary state, the spirit, not clothed in any covers that we could call material, represents a substance that we can only compare to the finest energy in the order of a first approximation. Only God and the monads are spiritual - an innumerable multitude of divine and god-created higher Is, indivisible spiritual units that differ from each other by the degree of their innate potential scale, the inexhaustible variety of their material coverings, and the path of their lives. A highly elevated monad can be in many places in the universe at once, but it is not omnipresent. But the Spirit of God is truly omnipresent - He is even present where there are no monads, such as in the ruins of Bramfatura abandoned by all monads. Nothing can exist without Him, not even what we call dead physical matter. And if the Spirit of God were to abandon it, it would cease to exist - not in the sense of transitioning to another form of matter or energy, but completely.

#### The origin of evil. - World laws. - Karma.

If the myth of the rebellion and fall of Lucifer is considered in relation to the spiritual history of Shadanakar, it loses its meaning. There have never been any events in the meta-history of our planet that could be reflected in the events of this myth. Something else happened once, a long time ago, about which memories, although very distorted, have been preserved in some other myths, for example - in the tale of the rebellion of the Titans. However, it is necessary to talk about this in more detail in another context.

As for the legends associated with the rebellion and fall of Lucifer, these events occurred once in the universal plane, on scales exceeding all categories of our minds, in the macrocosm that encompasses the universe. What happened, when translated by ancient seers into the plane of epochal human concepts, was cast into this myth. Epochal concepts have died out, our ideas have expanded immeasurably, and if we now want to grasp the immortal and true seed of the idea in this myth, we must disregard all epochal elements introduced into it and focus only on one central fact it asserts.

Naturally, even the wisest consciousness of those times was so far removed from current ideas about the size and structure of the Universe that the understanding of the cosmic, which seeped into their consciousness thanks to the efforts of invisible friends of their hearts, was crushed and compressed into the narrow confines of their empirical experience, their strong but unenriched and unrefined minds. However, it is no easier for those who are now trying to express in human concepts and words even a reverberation of the cosmic mystery of the rebellion of the so-called Deneb. Such an attempt would consist of two stages: first, searching for those concepts in the ocean of our ideas that are closer than others to reflecting this transcendent reality, and second, searching for word combinations in the ocean of our language that are capable of reflecting these elusive concepts in turn. But such work is connected with the organic growth of the personality and its cosmic experience. It cannot be forced by one's own whim. I feel that I am only at the beginning of this work. Therefore, I cannot say anything about universal events of this magnitude, except for the naked statement of a fact that once occurred: in the immemorial depths of time, a certain spirit, one of the greatest, called by us Lucifer or Deneb, expressing the freedom of choice that is inherently inherent in every monad, departed from his Creator for the sake of creating another universe according to his own plan. Many other monads, large and small, joined him. They began to create worlds within this one. They tried to create worlds, but these worlds were fragile and collapsed because, in rebelling, the apostate monads rejected love—the only unifying, cementing principle. The providential plan of the Universe leads many monads to the highest unity. As they ascend the steps of existence, the forms of their unions are perfected, and love for God and each other brings them closer and closer together. And when each of them is immersed in the Sun of the World and co-creates with Him, the most perfect unity is realized: merging with God without losing their unique selves.

The universal plan of Lucifer is opposite. Each of the monads that adhere to him is only his temporary ally and potential victim. Each demonic monad, from the greatest to the smallest, nurtures a dream - to become the ruler of the universe. Pride suggests to it that it is potentially stronger than everyone else - it is precisely it. It is guided by a kind of "categorical imperative," expressed to some extent by the formula: I am and there is non-I; all non-I must become me, in other words, everything and everyone must be absorbed by this one, absolutely self-affirming I. God gives Himself; the anti-divine element strives to absorb everything into itself. That is why it is primarily a vampire and a tyrant, and that is why the tyrannical tendency is not only inherent in any demonic self, but is an integral part of it.

Therefore, demonic monads unite temporarily with each other, but essentially they are not rivals for life, but for death. With the capture of local power by their group, this contradiction is soon revealed, mutual struggle begins, and the strongest wins.

The tragedy for demons in the course of space struggle is also due to the fact that the Lord creates new and new monads, while demons are incapable of creating even one, and the balance of power is continuously increasing not in their favor. No more new apostasies are committed and will never be committed again, there are absolute guarantees of this, and I deeply regret that the exceptional difficulty of this problem does not allow me to find the necessary set of concepts to present it in a somewhat reasonable way. In any case, all demonic monads are of very ancient origin, all of them are ancient participants in the great rebellion. True, not apostasies, but something externally similar: highly conscious beings, sometimes even a whole group of them, temporarily oppose themselves to the Providence's will. But this godless choice is made not by the monad itself, but by the lower Self, the limited consciousness of the soul. Therefore, its godless activity takes place not in the spiritual world, but in the material worlds subject to the law of retribution, which is subject to the will of the demons themselves. Thus, this rebellion is already doomed, and the one who committed it embarks on a long path of redemption. Gradually, in the course of the struggle, the demons themselves began to understand the futility of their attempts to create their own universe. While continuing to create separate worlds and making incredible efforts to strengthen their existence, they also set themselves another goal: to seize the worlds that are already existing or are currently being created by the Providence's forces. The goal is not the destruction of the worlds, but their seizure, but the destruction of the worlds is an objective consequence of such seizure. Deprived of the unifying principle of love and co-creation, cemented only by the contradictory principle of violence, worlds cannot exist for any significant length of time. There are galaxies that are collapsing. And when astronomical observations of extragalactic nebulae cover a longer period than they do now, the processes of these global catastrophes will be revealed to the eye of science. There are perished and perishing planets: Mars, Mercury, Pluto - the ruins of Bramfatura; all monads of Light were expelled from these systems, which fell under the demonic domination, after which the final catastrophe followed, and the demonic hordes were left homeless, wandering in the world space in search of a new object of invasion.

But there are brafmaturas and whole galaxies that the forces of the uprising could not invade. Within our galaxy, there is a system completely freed from demonic elements, Orion - a brafmatura of extraordinary power of spiritual Light. The same person who contemplates the great Andromeda nebula in a reflector will see another galaxy firsthand, which has never known demonic invasions. This is a world that rises from beginning to end through stages of increasing bliss. Among the millions of galaxies in the universe, there are many such worlds, but unfortunately, our galaxy is not among them. The forces of the Uprising, long ago expelled from the brafmaturas of the universe, lead an incessant, tireless struggle in the worlds of our galaxy, acquiring millions of forms to fight against the forces of Light; the arena of the struggle was also Shadanakar.

It became such an arena even in those distant times when the Earth in Enrofe was a semi-molten sphere, and the other layers of Shadanakar, which were still counted by single-digit numbers, were only created by the great hierarchies of brafmaturas. There was no law of devouring there: there, in the worlds of beings now known to us under the general name of angels, the principle of love and friendship of all prevailed. There was no law of death: each one passed from layer to layer through material transformation, free from suffering and not excluding the possibility of return. In these worlds, which then had only three dimensions of space and were therefore almost as dense as Enrof, there was no law of retribution, but mistakes were corrected with the help of higher powers. The glimmers of memories of this, rising from the treasuries of the deep memory into the consciousness of ancient sages, but reduced and simplified by their consciousness, led to the crystallization of the legend of the lost paradise. In reality, it was not a paradise, but a beautiful dawn, and it did not shine over the earthly Enrof, which was still devoid of organic life, but over the world now called Olirna, which shone then and remained in the memory of those few human monads who did not come to Shadanakar later, like most of them, but began their journey in it in times more ancient than antiquity, and not in Enrof, but in the angelic Olirna. This fellowship of proto-angels can be called, in a sense, the first humanity of Shadanakar.

Great demon, one of the followers of Lucifer, invaded Shadanakar with armies of lesser demons. His name is Gagtungur. It was a long and persistent struggle; it ended in his partial victory. He was unable to drive the forces of Light out of Bramfatura, but he managed to create several demonic layers and turn them into impregnable citadels. He managed to interfere with the process of the emergence and development of life on earthly Enrof and put his mark on the animal kingdom. Planetary laws, through which the forces of Light began to create organic life on Enrof, were unrecognizably distorted. It is false and blasphemous to attribute laws of mutual consumption, retribution, and death to the deity. "God is Light and in Him there is no darkness."

From God comes salvation only. From Him comes joy only. From Him comes grace only. And if the laws of the world strike us with their cruelty, it is because the voice of God in our soul rises up against the work of the Great Tormentor. The mutual struggle of demonic monads, the victory of the strongest, not the one who is more right, and the overthrow of the defeated into the abyss of torment - this law of Luciferian forces is reflected in the face of the organic world of Enrof, expressed here in the law of "struggle for existence". Every creature's suffering, every pain and torment it endures gives off radiation - here in Enrof, and there in the afterlife. Every feeling, every agitation of its spiritual nature cannot but give corresponding radiation. Radiation of anger, hatred, greed, and lust of animals and humans penetrate the demonic layers, replenishing the loss of life force among different classes and groups of their inhabitants. But these radiations are barely sufficient to replenish the loss of strength precisely in individual demonic communities. But the radiation of suffering and pain - it is called gavvah - is capable of saturating giant crowds of demons of almost all species and ranks. Essentially, gavvah is their food. Laying his paw on the laws of Shadanakar, Gagtungur distorted them to generate and multiply suffering. He made them burdensome, cruel, and intolerable. He prevented the establishment of the law of transform in Enrof; as the resultant of both warring forces, death arose and became the law. He hindered the principle of universal friendship; as the resultant of both forces, mutual consumption arose and became the law of life. And finally, the demonic forces interfered in the life of other layers of Shadanakar - those through which the path of beings who have ever been incarnated in earthly Enrof passed: these layers were turned into worlds of retribution, where torturers reign, feeding on the sufferings of the tormented. Among the various types of gavvah, the one associated with the flow of physical blood is of particular importance. When the blood of humans and animals flows out of the body, in the first minutes of this process, it emits a burning radiation of special power. Therefore, some classes of demons are interested not so much in the death of living beings in Enrof or in the afterlife suffering of their souls but precisely in bloodshed. No bloodshed in history has occurred or occurs without our unconscious suggestion of these otherworldly bloodsuckers.  And bloody sacrifices in some ancient cults were terrible not only in their cruelty, but also in that they nourished not the gods, of course, but precisely these demons.

To replenish the Light’s strength with the Planetary Logos, the first and greatest Monad of Shadanakar, a new layer was created and a new humanity was born. Enrof was left to the animal kingdom, while the new layer was populated by Titans, resembling us in appearance but enormous and magnificent. In a world resembling Enrof, but still dim, their luminous figures moved against a blue-gray, leaden sky, over the slopes and curves of desert mountains, perfecting them. The humanity of the Titans numbered a few thousand. They were without gender, and the birth of new ones was not linked to the union of two elders. But Gagtungur managed to incite their rebellion against Providence. Their idea was that they were the seed and nucleus of a new world beginning, the third, opposed to both God and demons. They thirsted for the absolute freedom of their egos but loathed the cruelty and malice of the demons. The rebellion ended with Gagtungur's forces using the law of retribution to plunge the souls of the Titans into deep torments. Their torture lasted for over a million years until, with the help of Providential forces, they managed to break free. Now most of them follow their path among humanity, standing out against the common background with the scale of their personality and a special somber, though not dark, coloration. Their creativity is marked by a vague memory of the struggle against the gods, as if scorched by ancient fire, and impresses with its power. Their spirits are distinct from the demonic Monads with their impulse towards the Light, contempt for the base, and thirst for divine love^^1.

____________
^^1: Among the figures of world culture, I could name several such names: Aeschylus, Dante, Leonardo, Michelangelo, Goethe, Beethoven, Wagner, Ibsen, Lermontov, Leo Tolstoy.

In the last millennia before Christ, Gagtungur's power was so great that in the afterlife layers of many meta-cultures of humanity, retribution lost its temporary nature. The way out of torment was firmly closed for the suffering, and hope was taken away from them.

This law of retribution, the iron law of moral causes and effects, the effects of which can manifest themselves in current life but are fully manifested in the afterlife and even in subsequent incarnations, can be called karma in Indian terminology. Karma is the same resultant of two opposite wills as the law of death and the law of struggle for existence. If the demonic forces did not encounter constant obstacles from their enemies, the laws would be even heavier, because the demonic purpose of laws is to generate the gavvahs and paralyze the manifestations of fallen souls of Light subject to them. The laws have another side, their purifying value. This is the remnant of the oldest bright grandlaws who pacified beautiful hierarchies; the goal of these hierarchies and all the bright forces of Shadankar is to soften and enlighten the laws; the goal of the demonic forces is to make them even heavier.

The purpose of Providence is to save all victims. The purpose of Gagtungur is to turn everyone into victims. The divine-humanity of the next world period will be a voluntary unity of all in love. The devil-humanity, apparently, will not be avoided at the end of the current period, and will be an absolute tyranny of one.

The cosmos is a field of becoming monads. Anticosmos is a universal union of opponents and a gathering of injured bright monads captured by demons in worlds over which they rule. These captives have been deprived of their most sacred attribute: freedom of choice.

The universe of Gagatungur is not bothered by the incomparability of its scale with the scale of Lucifer. Like all demonic monads, it understands its smallness only as a stage. Blind faith in its boundless growth and victory is inseparable from its ego. Any of these monads, no matter how miniature it may be at present and whatever subordinate position it may occupy in the hierarchy of the rebellious, believes in its impending macro-galactic triumph. Therefore, any of them, including Gagatungur, is a tyrant not only in principle and not only at the moment, but at every stage to the extent that the power achieved at this stage allows.

Tyranny causes such an abundant secretion of hawwah (an Arabic word for a type of energy associated with demonic power) like no other principle of leadership. The absorption of hawwah increases the reserve of demonic power. If a demon began to replenish the loss of its strength by infusion of other psychic emissions - joy, love, self-sacrifice, religious awe, enthusiasm, happiness - this would transform its nature, and it would cease to be a demon. But that is precisely what it does not want. Only tyranny, and only tyranny can tame the centrifugal forces inside the subordinate demonic sets. And that is why acts of apostasy and reverse uprising of individual demonic monads against Gagatungur occur occasionally in meta-history (and reflectively - in history).

Such rebellions, supported by the forces of Light, cannot be, because any such monad is potentially such a planetary demon. If it were stronger than Gagatungur, it would become an even greater torturer than he. However, it should not be forgotten that cases of the uprising of individual demonic monads are not so rare, not against Gagatungur as such, but against the demonic world order in general. Such rebellions are nothing more than demonic monads turning to the Light, and it is clear that they are then given all-round assistance by the Providential forces.

Despite the satanic wisdom of Gagatungur's global designs, these designs are fragile precisely because of the reasons mentioned, since the chances of taming all the demonic monads in the world, and in the future Lucifer himself, for a planetary demon are vanishingly small.

Despite all the satanic wisdom of the world plans of Gagtungur, these plans are precarious precisely because of the reasons mentioned. The chances of subduing all the demonic monads of the world, and in the future even Lucifer himself, for a planetary demon are disappearingly small. But the insatiable desire for universal domination constitutes the only source of understandable joys for him: he experiences such joys every time the slightest private victory seems to him a step closer to the ultimate goal. And these victories consist in enslaving other monads or their souls: demonic ones - as semi-allies, semi-slaves, light ones - as prisoners and objects of torment. As far as Gagtungur can imagine the cosmic future, he portrays himself as a kind of sun around which countless monads revolve in concentric circles, falling into it one after another and being absorbed - and gradually the whole Universe comes to this state of rotation around him, plunging, world after world, into a monstrously swollen hypermonad. The demonic mind is powerless to imagine further. Even the smaller of these monads are unable to draw even such an apotheosis. Unwaveringly believing in their ultimate victory over the Universe, they concentrate their will and thought on closer, more easily imaginable stages.

#### On the Question of Free Will

There is a certain prejudice, a particular mindset, that is common among many people today, as it has been carefully instilled into the consciousness of entire nations over the course of four decades. It is a way of thinking that leads the thinker to a conclusion that eventually becomes an axiom, a dogma: that religion takes away a person's freedom, requires blind obedience to higher powers, and places them completely under their control. And since these powers are mere phantoms, in reality dependence on all too real human authorities who seek to exploit the ignorance of the masses is strengthened. This is what "religious slavery" entails, from which humanity is liberated by science and materialistic philosophy.

To dispute this argument is to write a treatise with the aim of refuting the foundations of materialistic philosophy. Such treatises have already been written, and if they are still not well known in Russia, it is due not so much to philosophy as to politics.

As for the assertion that every religion demands submission to higher powers, there is no doubt that some religious doctrines do indeed preach predestination and the actual absence of free will in humans. This is a fact, and I am the least inclined to defend any form of religion indiscriminately. However, it is no more legitimate to generalize this trait to all religions in general than it is to claim, for example, that world literature is inherently reactionary and to justify this by citing individual reactionary writers and schools.

I would like to immediately clarify the injustice of such an accusation against the concept of the Rose of the World. First of all, I would like to express my confusion: no science or philosophy^^1, including materialistic ones, disputes the fact of human will's dependence on a multitude of material causes.

____________
^^1: Apart from subjective idealism.

It is precisely materialistic philosophy that insists on the complete dependence of the will on economic factors. And yet, no one is outraged by this diminishing of human agency in the face of natural and historical necessity. No one cries out against the enslavement of human beings to the law of gravity, the law of conservation of matter, the laws of evolution, economic development, and so on. Everyone understands that within these laws there is still sufficient room for the manifestation of our will.

However, the true concept of will does not add any new, additional factors to the list of factors that determine our will. It is not a matter of their number, but of their interpretation. That boundless and infinitely diverse realm that is united by the expression "higher powers" affects our will not so much by means of supernatural intrusions, but rather with the help of those very series of laws of nature, evolution, and so on, which we have just agreed to consider as objective facts. These series of facts largely determine our consciousness, and not only our consciousness, but also our subconscious and superconscious. Hence the emergence of those voices of conscience, duty, instinct, and so on, which we hear within ourselves and which visibly determine our behavior. This is the mechanism of the connection between "higher powers" and our will.

True, there are sometimes phenomena that subjectively may seem like violations of the laws of nature by "higher powers." These are called miracles. But where such phenomena really occur, and are not aberrations, there is no violation of natural laws by the "arbitrariness" of higher powers, but rather the manifestation of these powers through a series of other laws that are still unclear to us.

What often appears to us as a monolithic, simple, indivisible engine of our actions, for example, conscience, is in fact a very complex result of different series. In essence, conscience is the voice of our monad. But its access to the sphere of our consciousness is conditioned by the influence of other series: external circumstances, for example, some event that served as a push for this voice of the monad to be heard by us - this is the manifestation of Providence, the action of the forces of Providential nature.

Thus, a person's choice is predetermined by three series of forces. Providential forces that use the laws of nature and history as their instruments, gradually enlightening them; demonic forces that use the same laws and increasingly burden them; and the will of our own monad, presented to our consciousness through the voices of our heart and mind with the help of Providential forces.

Therefore, whether we consider the laws of nature and history as mechanical, soulless necessities or as tools of various living, personal, immaterial, or spiritual entities, the degree of our freedom will not decrease or increase. From the perspective of the Rose of the World concept, the degree of human choice and freedom is no less than that of materialism, but the factors that determine it are interpreted differently and more clearly articulated. And if the limitation of our freedom by completely impersonal and soulless laws of nature does not offend the materialist, then how can the limitation of our freedom by the will of Providential forces humiliate us? We can only be offended by the limitation of our freedom by the will of demonic forces; yes, it is offensive, but these are the very forces, our archenemies, the subjugation, transformation, and enlightenment of which is our entire goal. And we will stop experiencing this offense only when we make ourselves impervious to their influence. The evolution of world life leads ranks of beings from the minimal degree of freedom in the simplest forms (the voice of the Monad hardly reaches the rudimentary consciousness of a microbe, and its behavior is mainly determined by demonic forces acting through the laws of nature, as their transmission mechanism). Higher animals are already much freer than microbes, and the amplitude of their voluntary actions is much wider; in humans, it increases incomparably. Critics of religion as such point out that it requires renunciation of personal will, requires submission of our will to the deity. And they are right in relation to some religions of the past. But the Rose of the World is not a religious teaching of the past. It is a religious and socio-ethical teaching of the future. The Rose of the World does not require any "submission" to the will of God, because only what is done voluntarily by a person is valuable, not by coercion. The demand for slavish submission to the will of the deity will not be heard from the sanctuaries of the religion of the future. From there will emanate the call for universal love and free deification.

The Lord is an unchanging and ineffable supreme aspiration, a spirit-creating power that acts in all souls, never ceasing even in the depths of demonic monads, guiding worlds and worlds, from microcosms to super-galaxies, towards something more perfect than good and higher than bliss. The higher the level of each self, the more fully its will coincides with the creative will of the Lord. And when it, having started its cosmic path from the simplest forms of living matter, passes through the stages of human demiurge, planet and star demiurge, and galaxy demiurge, it will, through the Son of God, be immersed in the Father, and its will will fully coincide with the will of the Father, its power with the power of the Father, its image with the image of the Father, and its creativity with the creativity of the Father.

Theurgy is the bright creativity of all monads of the ascending stream of the Universe, from humans, poets, and enlightened animals to the demiurges of galaxies, unimaginably giant beings. That is why the word "demiurge" is so often used here, which was hardly used in ancient religions. Demiurges are all those who create for the glory of God, out of love for the world and its First Creator.

He is absolutely good. "He is omnipotent," added the old theology. But if He is omnipotent, He is responsible for the evil and suffering in the world. Therefore, He is not good. It seems impossible to break out of this circle of contradiction.

But the Lord creates from Himself. All monads that flow from His depth have the properties of this depth, including absolute freedom. Thus, divine creativity itself limits the Creator, defining His power by the line beyond which lie the freedoms and powers of His creations. But freedom is freedom precisely because it includes the possibility of different choices. And in the being of many monads, it was determined by their negative choice, their affirmation only of themselves and their apostasy from God. Hence what we call the evil of the world, hence suffering, hence cruel laws, and hence the fact that this evil and suffering can be overcome. The laws protect the world from turning into chaos. The demons themselves are forced to reckon with them, so that the worlds do not disintegrate into dust. Therefore, they do not overthrow the laws, but they burden them. The laws are blind. And they can be enlightened not in a moment, not by a miracle, not by external intervention of the Deity, but by a long cosmic path of overcoming the evil will of apostate monads.

God's all-embracing love and inexhaustible creativity are merged into one. All living things, including humans, approach God through three divine qualities inherent in them: freedom, love, and theurgy. Theurgy is the goal, love is the way, freedom is the condition.

Demoniacal monads are free, like all others, but their love is deeply harmful. It is directed exclusively inward: the demon loves only himself. And therefore, since the entire mighty stock of love residing in his spirit is concentrated on this one, the demon loves himself with such great force that no human can love himself.

The ability to create cannot be lost by demonic monads. But theurgy causes nothing but extreme hostility in them. Every demon creates only for himself and in his own name.

A person's creativity becomes God-creation from the moment and to the extent that their irresistible creative impulse is directed by the effort of their will and faith not towards achieving selfish goals such as glory, pleasure, material success, or serving cruel and base doctrines, but towards serving God with love.

The three words - freedom, love, and God-creation - define the attitude of the Rose of the World towards art, science, education, marriage, family, nature, and even neglected elements of life such as its improvement and beauty by all religions.

#### Being and Consciousness

The discussions of centuries-old dispute about the primacy of consciousness or being have brought us to a new perspective. Idealistic schools formulated the idea that "consciousness determines being". In the subsequent secular phase of culture, this formula was turned inside out, but its material remained intact. However, the material consisted of the opposition of two terms, and therefore the new formula inherited the primitivism of its predecessor.

The question is more complex than these formulas suggest. And yet, it is simpler than the cumbersome structures of propositions and conclusions that were piled up in the 18th and 19th centuries in order to extract such a modest result.

"Being determines consciousness" ... "Consciousness determines being" ... Whose being? Whose consciousness? Of an individual person? Of humanity? Of the world? Of living, conscious matter? How confused and vague it all is.

The consciousness of an individual person (for simplicity, we will only talk about humans) is determined not by someone else's consciousness or by being in general, but by a sum of factors. Namely:

1. their own physical being;
2. the being of their natural and cultural environment;
3. the consciousnesses of the multitude of people who live and have lived, for these consciousnesses largely 4. determined the cultural environment in which the individual lives and which affects their being and consciousness;
4. the consciousness of a large number of other beings who have influenced the natural environment and transformed it;
5. the being and consciousness of peacekeeping hierarchies;
6. the superconscious, but individual content that is inherent in the monad of the given person;
7. the being-consciousness of the One, in which being and consciousness are one, not different, opposing categories.

If the question is not about an individual person with their being and consciousness, but about the Universe, or more precisely, about the emergence of consciousness in the organic nature of any worlds, then it is clear that since the Universe is determined by the One, this opposition of being and consciousness is lifted for the reason just mentioned. And since the Universe is determined by the creativity of the god-created monads, the question of some moment of the appearance of consciousness in it after a period of unconsciousness loses its meaning. For if there were no god-created monads with their consciousness and being, then no matter, neither organic nor inorganic, could have arisen.

One could only jokingly make fun of the primitiveness of the classical formulas if one of them, becoming a philosophical dogma of political despotism, had not been responsible for countless misfortunes, clogging the airways of thought like a cork.

Another of the classic formulas, equally erroneous, is nonetheless less dangerous precisely because it is more spiritual. But this does not absolve the old religions with their philosophers of guilt: to spend so many centuries on scholastic musings and not take a single step closer to the question of the primacy of being or consciousness.

#### The non-material structure of a human

Among the numerous layers of Shadanakar, there is a multidimensional world where human monads reside - indivisible and immortal spiritual units, the higher self of humans. Created by God and only by God, and some (few) mysteriously born by Him, they enter Shadanakar, cloaked in the finest matter - which would be more correctly called energy: it is a substance that permeates all of Shadanakar; each individual spirit, entering our Brahmfatura, inevitably becomes clothed in it.

The world in which our monads reside is called Iroln.

The creative work leading to the enlightenment of the Universe is the task of each monad, except for demonic ones; among humans, there are no demonic monads. Human monads carry out this work in the lower worlds subject to their enlightening creativity, creating material domains for themselves there and through these domains, influencing the environment of the corresponding layers.

First and foremost, the monad creates a shield of materiality from five-dimensional spaces, then an astral body from the materiality of four-dimensional spaces.

Both of these cloudings are often merged in our understanding under the word "soul." The shell is the material receptacle of the Monad with all its divine properties and its nearest instrument. Not the Monad itself, remaining in the five-dimensional Irhólene, but the shell itself is the "I" that begins its journey through the lower layers. The shell is created by the Monad itself, while in the creation of the astral body, the great element, Mother Earth, takes part. She participates in the creation of the astral bodies of all beings of Shadanakar - humans, angels, demons, animals, elementals, demons, and even the great hierarchies when they descend into the layers where the astral body is necessary. This body is the highest tool of the shell. It concentrates the abilities of spiritual sight, hearing, smell, deep memory, ability to fly, ability to communicate with synclites, demons, elementals, angels, the ability to sense cosmic panoramas and perspectives.

Next, Mother Earth, impregnated by the Spirit of the Sun, creates for the incarnating Monad an etheric body without which no life is possible in the worlds of three and four dimensions. And when the shell with all its clouds, including the etheric, leaves in Enrof the most external, short-lived, last of its vessels - the physical body, only the corpse remains in Enrof. The physical body is created for us by the angelic hierarchies - they create the matter itself - and by the great elemental of humanity - Lilith - who shapes the chain of the race out of this three-dimensional materiality. The impact of the Monad itself in this act through the shell lies in the fact that it gives individuality to this link in the race.

Thus the process of descent ends; the process of ascent begins. The physical body can be taken by the Monad once or, again and again, many times. The etheric, however, is created anew only if the carrier, falling under the law of retribution, was forced to make a path through the circles of great sufferings. And in the ascending path, the etheric body accompanies the carrier through all the worlds of Enlightenment up to the Zatomi - the abodes of the enlightened humanity, the heavenly cities of metaculture. It consists of vital substance, not universal, but different in all three-dimensional and four-dimensional worlds. Remembering the most ancient revelation of humanity, it would be fair to call it arungvílta-prana.

The astral body accompanies the carrier up to a certain point, including the Sakuala of High Duty, and only the enlightened Shellt remains above, fully merged with the Monad into unity. Then the Monad leaves Irulan and, clothed in an extremely subtle Shell, ascends the stairs to the highest worlds of Shadanakar.

In the subsequent parts of the book, we will discuss all of these layers, and many of them will be described as much as possible. But in more detail I am unfortunately unable to shed light on the questions about the interaction of different layers of the monad, their functions, and their structure.

#### Metacultures

The structure of Shadanakar, which we will soon have to address in its colossal complexity, will remain incomprehensible at its core if we do not first understand what a superethnic group, metaculture, and transmyth are.
The term "superethnic group" refers to a collection of nations united by a common, jointly created culture, or a separate nation whose culture was created by them alone and has achieved a high degree of individuality and brilliance.

It is understood that there are no completely isolated cultures, as they are interconnected, but overall, each culture is quite distinctive, and despite the influence it exerts on others, it remains the achievement of only one superethnic group, its creator.

The concept of a super-people could have been left out of the current concept if it did not have, in addition to historical significance, also a meta-historical significance. And its meta-historical significance lies in the fact that the uniqueness of the super-people is not limited to the cultural sphere in Enrof, but is also evident in many other immaterial layers of both ascending and descending orders, since some sections of these layers are affected only by one particular super-people. It should not be forgotten that a super-people refers not only to the individuals who currently belong to it, not only to our contemporaries, but also to many of those who belonged to it before, even at the dawn of its history, and later, in their post-death state, acted and continue to act in the transphysical layers associated with this super-people. A ladder of layers rises above humanity, common to all super-peoples, but above each of them these layers change their color, their physiognomy, their content; there are even layers that exist only above one super-people. The same is true of the demonic worlds of the descending order, which exist as if under super-peoples. Thus, a significant part of Shadanakar consists of separate multilayered segments; the Enrof layer in each of these segments is occupied only by one super-people and its culture. These multilayered segments of Shadanakar are called metacultures.

Each super-people has its own myth. This myth is created not only in the childhood period of its history, but throughout its existence. As the traditional use of the word "myth" does not coincide with the meaning that is invested in it here, it is necessary to carefully explain what concept I am investing in this word. When we speak of a strictly coordinated system of ideologically saturated images embodying some comprehensive international doctrine and finding its expression in traditions and cults, theosophemes and philosophemes, literary monuments and in the visual arts, and finally in the code of morality, we are talking about the myths of the great international religions. There are four such myths: Hindu, Buddhist, Christian, and Islamic.

When we talk about a strictly coordinated system of ideologically saturated images that determine the attitude towards Enrof, towards transphysical and spiritual measurements from the perspective of a particular super-people, about a system that has taken shape into a particular religion and played a significant role in the history of that super-people but almost did not spread beyond its borders, we are talking about the national religious myths of individual super-peoples. Such are the Egyptian, ancient Iranian, Jewish, ancient Germanic, Gallic, Aztec, Inca, Japanese, and some others.

When we mean a world of images that are just as ideologically saturated and possibly related, although not so closely, to the ideas of religious and moral order but have not developed into a coherent system and reflect a series of common moral, transphysical, meta-historical, or universal truths in connection with the givenness and obligation of this culture, we have before us the general myths of super-peoples. These include the myths of the southwestern Roman Catholic super-people, the northwestern German Protestant super-people, and the Russian super-people^^1.

____________
^^1: In some cultures, such as in Greco-Roman or Babylonian-Assyrian-Canaanite, the development of myths has already moved beyond the "general" stage, but has not yet formed a system strict enough for us to classify the Olympic and Babylonian myths as part of the group of national-religious myths of super-ethnic groups.

Finally, the last, fourth group is the general national myths, which are the myths of individual nationalities that are part of the super-people but create their own particular, very local variant in addition to the general super-national myth, which does not shine through any strict system or religion. Examples could include pagan myths of Slavic tribes, Finnish tribes, Turkic tribes, as well as myths of some isolated and backward tribes of India. In essence, myths of nationalities are found in many ethnic formations in their embryonic state, but they rarely acquire a strongly defined physiognomy.

We will not apply the word "myth" to any other phenomena in the history of culture. Thus, the last three groups of myths are specific to individual cultures. The first group, however - the myths of international religions - is mystically connected (with the exception of one) to the layers of Shadanakar that are already above its segmental divisions, called metacultures.

It seems to me that the concept of national-religious myths is easily understood. As for the common myths of super-peoples, for clarity, a couple of additional definitions should be given.

The inductive definition is as follows: the common myth of a super-people is the sum of its representations of the transphysical cosmos, of the participation in it of a given culture and of each individual who enters this culture of I^^1 - representations that are developed by this culture, taking the form of a cycle of religious-philosophical ideas, a cycle of artistic images, a cycle of socio-ethical concepts, a cycle of state-political attitudes, and finally, a cycle of common national norms that are realized in ritual, in everyday life, and in custom.

____________
^^1: At the same time, the very concept of "given culture" may not be understood more clearly than it was, for example, by the Greco-Romans, with their opposition of themselves to the rest of humanity as barbarians.

The deductive definition is as follows: the common myth of a super-people is the realization by the super-people, through its most creative representatives, of some second reality, overhanging it, into which it enters as part of its being and in which the guidance of its formation and the roots of its destiny are hidden - a realization that is clouded by extraneous admixtures arising from unordered human nature. This second reality, which serves as an object of transphysical and meta-historical, artistic and philosophical comprehension, can be conventionally denoted by the term "transmyth."

Naturally, the degree of difference between a myth and a transmyth can be quite varied. The limitations of those who perceived transmyths through intuition, dreams, artistic inspiration, religious contemplation, meta-historical enlightenment; the national, epochal, class, and personal characteristics of these consciousnesses and the subconscious realm of their beings that actively participate in this process; the impossibility of finding exact analogies in words or three-dimensional art images to express the reality of immeasurable worlds - can all lead to countless aberrations, to cluttering the myth with a mass of random, inaccurate, anthropomorphic, primitive, even simply unsuccessful elements. But myth is dynamic, it moves in time, develops, changes faces, and its later phases, as a rule, are closer to the transmyth, because over the centuries, the perceiving consciousnesses themselves have become more refined, richer, more perceptive, and broader.

But at the same time, the transmyth itself is evolving. The transcendental reality is full of turbulent motion, there can be no talk of statics. Just as the fortified cities of the Merovingian era differ from modern-day Paris, so do the landscapes, structures, and all the content of transmyths differ in the era of their emergence and at the end of their meta-historical development.

But at all stages of the development of the supra-national transmyth, alongside the Enrofan people who comprehend it, there are two other realities, two other layers, two poles of the metacultural sphere. Other layers surround and exist between them, but each of them emerged later or underwent radical changes; some disappeared. Only three domains are immutable and long-lasting: in Enrof, the supra-national realm; in the hyperdimensional space above it, the abode of its enlightened souls, the sacred cities, the celestial realm of metaculture; and at the bottom, in the descending worlds, the antipole of this celestial realm, the citadel built in the worlds connected with the deep strata of the planet's physical body. This is the focal point of the demonic forces of this metaculture. The celestial realms and everything within them are called "zatomises", while the underground citadels are called "shrastars". Typically, these two poles are more brightly and clearly reflected in myths, particularly the zatomises. The images of shrastars are not always in a finished form. The zatomises, however, the abodes of the synclites of metacultures, can be found in the myths of all supra-national peoples, both religious and secular. Such is the Eanna of the Babylonians: the ziggurat in the city of Erech was, according to the Sumerians and Akkadians, a likeness of the mountain of the gods, the celestial Eanna, and later a similar meaning was discerned by the Babylonians in the main cult building of their great city - the seven-tiered temple of Esagila. Such is the Olympus of the Greeks and Romans. Such is the Sumeru (Meru) of the Indians - the Indian Olympus, on the slopes of which shine the celestial cities of the gods of Hinduism. Such are the images of Heaven - Eden in the metacultures of Byzantine and Roman Catholicism, Jannat in Arab-Muslim culture, Shang-Chi in Chinese culture, Monsalvat in Northwest culture, and Kitezh in Russian metaculture.

Through the swirling clouds of art, beliefs, mythologies, and social structures, as we try to discern the heavenly realm of the Northwest metaculture, we must not forget for a moment that super-peoples, as long as they exist in Enrof, never complete the creation of their myths. Forms of expression change: new human groups emerge as expressers onto the historical stage; from anonymous folklore creators and ritualists, the task of mythmaking passes to thinkers and artists, whose names are lifted by waves of popular love, but the myth lives on. It lives on, deepening, filling with new content, revealing new meanings in old symbols, and introducing new symbols - in accordance with a higher stage of the general cultural development of the perceivers - firstly, and in accordance with the living meta-historical development of the trans-myth - secondly.

The heavenly realm of the Northwest culture appears to us in the image of Monsalvat, an eternally radiant mountain peak, where righteous knights from century to century guard in a cup the blood of the Incarnate Logos, collected by Joseph of Arimathea at the crucifixion and handed over to the wanderer Titurel, the founder of Monsalvat. At a distance from Monsalvat stands the ghostly castle created by the sorcerer Klingsor: the focal point of the apostate forces that relentlessly seek to crush the power of the Brotherhood - the keepers of the highest sanctuary and mystery. These are the two poles of the general myth of the Northwest super-people, from nameless creators of ancient Celtic legends, through Wolfram von Eschenbach to Richard Wagner. The assumption that the revelation of this image is complete in Wagner's Parsifal is by no means indisputable, but perhaps premature. The trans-myth of Monsalvat is growing, becoming increasingly grandiose. Let us hope that thinkers and poets will still emerge from the depths of the Northwest peoples, to whom meta-historical illumination will allow them to comprehend and depict the heavenly realm of Monsalvat as it is today.

It is easy to understand that the majority of even the largest human forms of the Northwest myth are not directly related and cannot be directly related to the image of Monsalvat. To expect an inevitable direct connection would mean to reveal a narrow and formal approach and even a complete misunderstanding of what a common super-national, rather than religious-national myth is.

In the end, any human image created by a great writer, artist, composer, who lives in the consciousness and subconsciousness of millions and becomes the inner property of anyone who creatively perceives that image, is a mythical image. Kriemhild and Ophelia, Macbeth and Brandt, Esther of Rembrandt and Margarita of Goethe, Egmont and Mr. Pickwick, Jean Christoph and Jolyon Forsyte are all equally mythical, just like Lohengrin and Parsifal. But what is the connection between artistic images, as well as philosophical and social ideas of Northwestern culture, and the poles of the Northwestern myth - Montsalvat and the castle of Klingsor?

The poles of any super-ethnic myth are surrounded by a multitude of circles, whole worlds of images, the connection of which with the center does not depend on their plot, but on internal affinity, on the possibility for us to think these images and understand them through meta-historical contemplation in the center of the myth or next to it.

Faust, of course, is not Merlin: Byron's Cain is not Klingsor: Peer Gynt is not Amfortas, and to compare Hauptmann's Emmanuel Quint to Parsifal at first seems strange. The image of Kundry, so significant in the center of the myth, probably has no equivalent parallel on its periphery. On the other hand, we will not find any prototypes of Hamlet and Lear, Margarita or Solveig in the center of the Northwestern myth. But their gaze is directed there; a reddish reflection can be seen on their clothes - either of the Grail or of the magical fires of Klingsor. These colossal figures, rising at different levels of artistic realism, at different stages of mystical enlightenment, resemble sculptures guarding the ascent along the steps of the ladder to the sanctuary where the highest secret of the Northwestern peoples resides - the sanctuary that sends spiritual waves of Providence and favor to countries covered by thickening darkness.

Do we only see reflections of the radiance from this holy shrine or from the radiance of another pole of the same myth, the devilish castle of Klingsor, only in legends about the Knights of the Round Table or only in the mysteries of Bayreuth? If Monsalvat ceases to be a simple poetic image for us, one among others, and becomes endowed with its true significance, the significance of the highest reality, we will see its reflection in Gothic abbeys and Baroque ensembles, in the paintings of Ruysdael and Dürer, in the landscapes of the Rhine and the Danube, of Bohemia and Brittany, in the rose windows behind church altars, and in the austere cult of Lutheranism. This reflection will become clear to us even in the godless, soulless palace parks of the Sun King, and in the outlines of cities rising from the ocean like entire Pamirs of skyscrapers. We will see it in the poetry of the romantics and in the works of great playwrights, in Freemasonry and Jacobinism, in the systems of Fichte and Hegel, even in the doctrines of Saint-Simon and Fourier. A special work would be required to indicate that the power of modern science, the miracles of technology, as well as the ideas of socialism, even communism, on the one hand, and Nazism on the other, are encompassed by the sphere of the myth of Monsalvat and the castle of Klingsor. Nothing, no scientific discoveries of our day, including mastery of atomic energy, takes Northwestern humanity beyond the limits outlined by the prophetic symbolism of this myth. It is believed that whoever reads this book will understand these as yet undiscovered interconnections. - Chapter 3. The Original Concept. I spoke of one of the metacultures with its myth and transmyth only to help understand the idea of the heavenly lands of humanity residing in the enlightened layers on the peaks of metacultures and to reflect on their antipodes - the strongholds of apostate principles actively creating their anti-cosmos and struggling against the forces of Light in all supra-nationalities of Enrof, in all layers, in all metacultural zones.

But the ladder of Shadanakar's layers does not end where the segments of metacultures end: beyond, there are five-dimensional and six-dimensional worlds, which also received their vague reflection in the myths and religions of humanity. In this sense, the name "transmyth" is also applicable to many of these layers. But in a narrower and higher sense, the word "transmyth" applies to a special Sakuala: a system of worlds with five dimensions of space and a huge number of temporal coordinates; these are five grand, as if glowing from within with solar radiance, beautiful and transparent pyramids, immovably towering above Enrof. Not only Enrof, but also the celestial realms of metacultures seem deeply below from there, in the darkness. These worlds are the highest aspects of three (not four!) great international religions and two religions that have almost not broken their national isolation due to a number of historical reasons, but carrying both the reflection of their own depths and this incomparably higher Sakuala. About this Sakuala, more will be said in one of the following parts.

I want to make a preliminary remark on this matter. I think that many who read this book have a sense of incomprehension: why are all the new words and names that denote the countries of the transphysical world and the layers of Shadanakar, even the names of almost all hierarchies, non-Russian? And this is because Russian metaculture is one of the youngest: when its Synclite began to emerge, everything was already named by others. Often, in these words, one can hear sounds reminiscent of Sanskrit, Latin, Greek, Hebrew, and Arabic languages, and sometimes even more ancient languages that no philologist knows yet. Naturally, I do not know them either; only by these individual words, I judge their strange phonetic physiognomy.

Now, it seems to me, everything has been said that would make the subsequent parts of the book somewhat understandable. Before us are four parts, almost entirely dedicated to describing the structure of Shadanakar - a kind of transphysical geography. Only by forming an understanding of the arena and the participants of the meta-historical mystery, even if only an approximate one, can we move on to the parts that are dedicated to the meta-historical processes themselves, especially the meta-history of Russia and its culture, and also the meta-history of modern times. This is related to the tasks and specific program of the Rose of the World, to the presentation of the historical paths on which it is possible to achieve bloodless unification of humanity into a single organism, universal abundance, the upbringing of generations of refined character, the transformation of the planet into a garden, and the transformation of a world government into a brotherhood. From here, a bridge will be thrown to the last chapters: to some distant historical predictions, to the problem of concluding cataclysms of world history, and to the inevitable, though catastrophic, transition of Enrof to another higher materiality, to another layer of being. The last pages are dedicated to cosmic perspectives that are revealed during this process.

## Book III. The Structure of Shadanakar. The Worlds of the Ascending Series.

### Chapter 1. Sakuala of Enlightenment.

I don't know where or when I will die this time, but I know where and when I died for the last time before being born in 1906 for a life in Russia. Of course, this knowledge is of no general significance and may only interest those who are able to trust my testimony and feel a karmic connection with my destiny. But my knowledge of some of the stages of the path between my penultimate existence and the current one, in terms of its objective interest, is broader, and I can and should tell about the most significant of what I have gradually remembered.

However, it is better to say not "I have managed to remember," but "I have been helped to remember." I have occasionally met people who possessed such openness of deep memory, but none of them dared to talk about it with almost anyone, and nobody even had a vague idea of ​​trying to record these memories in writing. The reason for this was the belief that such confessions could only cause ridicule and natural emotional modesty, which resists exposing to the judgment of strangers what is intimate, inviolable, and at the same time unprovable.

For a very long time, I looked at the matter in the same way, and even now I undertake this attempt without the slightest pleasure. But since decisively everything that I describe in this book has an equally unproven source, I no longer see any reason to remain silent specifically about breakthroughs of deep memory. I either should not have started the book at all, or since I have started, I should talk about everything, despite my fears. Moreover, my hope is strengthened that readers who do not trust me have already been weeded out after the first few chapters, and only people predisposed to benevolence will continue to follow my narrative.

My last death occurred about three hundred years ago in a country that leads another very ancient and powerful metaculture. Throughout my current life, from childhood on, I have been tormented by nostalgia for this old homeland; perhaps it burns so deeply because I lived not one, but two very intense lives in that country. However, when I left Enroth three hundred years ago, for the first time in my entire journey through Shadankar, I was free from the necessity of atoning for posthumous descents into the depths of the layers where the suffering untangle karmic knots they tied in life, sometimes for centuries, even millennia. For the first time, I managed to untie the knots in Enroth, paying for my youthful mistakes and failures with long-lasting torment and bitter losses. And for the first time, I died with a light soul, although according to the religious beliefs of that country, I should have expected a truly terrible afterlife. But I already knew that I had redeemed myself from the caste exclusion and forty years of life among the pariahs. Death was easy and full of hope.

It was a tangible hope that does not deceive. I still cannot remember the first few hours or even days of my new existence. But I do remember a few locations of that new layer in which I existed for a long time afterward.

This layer, shared by all metacultures, was very diverse, though. In the ancient, tropical, huge metaculture that embraced my earthly life twice, it was similar to the nature of Enroth but softer, without the extremes of its cruelty and magnificence, without the violent tropical rains and the destructive dryness of deserts. I remember how white tower-like clouds of extraordinary strength and grandeur stood almost motionless above the horizon, rising to the middle of the sky: nights and days changed, and the giant radiant towers remained almost the same. But the sky itself was not blue or turquoise but deep green. And the sun was more beautiful there than with us: it played with different colors, slowly and smoothly changing them, and I cannot explain why the color of the source of light did not determine the colors of what it illuminated: the landscape remained almost the same, dominated by green, white, and golden colors.

There were rivers and lakes; there was an ocean, although I never got to see it: once or twice I was only on the sea coast. There were mountains, forests, and open spaces, reminiscent of a steppe. But the vegetation in these zones was almost transparent and as light as the forests in the northern countries of Enroth in late spring when they are just starting to dress in a leafy covering. The ridges of the mountains and even the soil seemed just as light and semi-transparent: as if all of this was the ethereal substance of those elements whose physical substance we know so well in Enroth.

However, this layer was unknown to birds, fish, or animals: only humans remained its inhabitants. And by humans, I mean not the kind that we are in Enroth, but the kind that death makes us in the first of the worlds of Enlightenment. Finally, I could see for myself that the solace we draw from old religions with thoughts of reunions with loved ones is not a legend or deception, provided that what we have done in life has not carried us into the sorrowful layers of atonement. Some of my loved ones met me, and the joy of being with them became the content of whole periods of my life in that layer.

It is very ancient, once inhabited by angelic proto-humans, and it is called Olyrn: this musical word seems to me a fortunate discovery by those who gave it its name. Communication with loved ones contained no murkiness, bitterness, petty concerns, or misunderstanding that mar it here: it was ideal communication, partly through speech, but more often in silence, which here is only familiar in communication with a few with whom we are connected by particularly deep love, and in particularly deep moments.

We were completely liberated from the need for existence that had such immense importance in Enroth. The need for housing was eliminated by the mildness of the climate. It seems that in Olyrn and some other metacultures this is not entirely the case, but I don't remember the details exactly. Delicious vegetation provided food, and springs and streams served as drinks, with different tastes as far as I can remember. Clothing, or rather, that beautiful, living, misty, glowing substance that we try to replace with wool, silk, or linen products in Enroth, was produced by our own bodies: by that ethereal body of ours that we hardly ever recognize on ourselves here, but which becomes just as obvious and just as important for us in the afterlife as the physical body is. And in the worlds of Enlightenment, as well as in Enroth, life without it is impossible.

And yet the first period in Olyrne was poisoned by the sadness of those left behind in Enrof. Children and grandchildren, friends and my old wife, the most precious creature to me, for whom I broke the caste law and became untouchable, remained there. Cutting off contact with them nourished a constant anxiety about their fate. Soon, I learned to see their vague shapes wandering along Enrof's thorny paths. And after a while, I would meet my wife again, just as young as she used to be but even more beautiful. Her journey in Enrof would end a few years after mine, and now the joy of our reunion was not tainted by anything.

New perception organs opened up one after the other: not the vision and hearing organs that fully coincide with the corresponding organs of the physical body in the etheric body - no! These vision and hearing organs were functioning from the first minutes of my stay in Olyrne, and it was through them that I perceived Olyrne. But what we call spiritual vision, spiritual hearing, and deep memory; what the greatest sages in Enrof strive to unfold; what is only revealed there by the few among the many millions; what unfolds gradually for everyone in Olyrne. Spiritual vision and hearing overcome obstacles between many layers. I perceived the lives of those left behind on Earth precisely through them - still indistinctly, but I perceived.

I enjoyed the enlightened nature - such visual beauty I had never seen in Enrof - but it was strange: there was something lacking in this nature, and soon I realized what it was: the diversity of life. I sadly remembered the singing and chirping of birds, the buzzing of insects, the flicker of fish, the beautiful forms, and the unconscious wisdom of higher animals. Only here did it become clear to me how much the animal world means to us, to our communication with nature. However, those who knew more than me gave hope that the ancient, vague dream of humanity about the existence of layers where animals appear enlightened and highly intelligent - not a dream, but a presentiment of truth: such layers exist, and over time, I will enter them.

Later, quite recently, I was reminded of certain zones that exist in the Olirns of all metacultures. They spoke of areas resembling hilly steppes, where those who were too closed in on themselves in Enrof, whose karmic knots were untied but whose souls were too narrow and constricted, would stay for a while. Now, among the transparent, quiet hills, under the magnificent sky, nothing prevents them from repairing this damage by taking in the rays and voices of the cosmos and expanding the boundaries of their expanding selves. They also spoke of zones in Olirna resembling mountainous countries, where those who were able to believe - or rather, to feel the afterlife with certainty - worked on themselves only in the afterlife. From there, they contemplated the mountain peaks, not as we see them, but in spiritual glory. The powerful spirits that rule there pour streams of their strength into those who contemplate them. And the abilities of the soul, paralyzed by disbelief, are revealed there, in the days and years of direct contemplation of the multi-layeredness of the universe and the solemn greatness of other worlds. But I don't remember how clearly, perhaps because I was only a guest there, and the source of this information does not inspire me with absolute confidence that the information is not simplified for my understanding, and therefore not distorted.

In addition to communicating with people and enjoying nature, time was spent working on my body: I had to prepare it for transformation, because the path from Olirna to the higher worlds does not lie through death, but through transformation. And I understood that the verses of the Gospel, which tell of the ascension of Jesus Christ, hint at something similar. The resurrection from the dead changed the nature of His physical body, and during the ascension from Olirna, it was transformed again together with the etheric. For me, like everyone else, only the etheric body was to be transformed; a transformation similar to what the apostles once saw with their sight, penetrating Olirna, but not yet reaching the worlds above. How else could the evangelists express the Savior's transition from Olirna there, except by calling it His ascension to heaven? And I, brought up in strict Brahmanism, began to understand how strange the Christian myth, full of bottomless truth, was for me.

And the image of the great traitor, which I had previously only regarded as a legend, became a reality for me: I learned that he is now here, amidst the seas of Olyrnia, in deep seclusion, on a deserted island. His path through suffering lasted more than sixteen centuries. Burdened by the weight of a karma that was incomparable in its heaviness, in the deepest of them all, which had never before or since seen a single human being, he was lifted from there by the One Who had been betrayed on earth, but only after the Betrayed One had achieved such incredible spiritual power in his post-death state, which was necessary for this and which no one had previously attained in Shadanakar. Raised by the forces of Light up and up through the steps of purgatory, having atoned for his betrayal, he finally reached Olyrnia. Still not interacting with its inhabitants, he prepares on the island for further ascension. I saw this island from afar: it is harsh, with a pile of strange rocks inside, the peaks of which are all tilted in one direction. The peaks are sharp, the color of the rocks is very dark, almost black in some places. But no one sees Judas in Olyrnia: they only see the glow of his prayers over the island at night. In the future, when the kingdom of the one commonly referred to as the Antichrist comes in Enroth, Judas, having received a great mission from the Betrayed One, will be born again on earth and, having fulfilled it, will meet a martyr's end at the hand of the prince of Darkness.

But I could not explain the exact efforts that led to my own transformation or what was actually happening to my body at that moment. Now I can only recall what was before my eyes: a multitude of people, perhaps hundreds, who came to accompany me on the high path. Achieving transformation for anyone living in Olyr is always a joy for others; the event is surrounded by a solemn, bright, and happy atmosphere. Obviously, the event occurred during the day, on a raised area like a hill and, like everything in Indian Olyr, under the open sky. I remember how the rows of faces turned gradually mistier and seemed to move away from me, or rather, apparently, I myself moved away from them, rising above the ground. In the distance, on the horizon, I saw a semi-transparent mountain range, as if made of chrysolite, which suddenly began to emit amazing radiance. Shimmering rainbows crossed each other across the sky, and wonderful celestial bodies of different colors appeared in the zenith, and the magnificent sun could not eclipse them. I remember the feeling of overwhelming beauty, incomparable joy, and amazement. When my gaze dropped, I saw that the crowds that had accompanied me were no longer there, and the entire landscape had been completely transformed, and I understood that the moment of my transition to a higher level had already passed.

I had been warned that I would not stay in this layer for very long, because everyone who passes through it does so in a few hours, but during these hours, the entire layer, called Fayr, would be filled with rejoicing for me, who had achieved it. This is a great holiday, destined for every ascending soul, not only human, but also for the souls of other monads of Shadanakar, ascending through the stages of Enlightenment, even the higher animals. In a sense, Fayr is a threshold of the path: after it, reincarnations can still occur in Enrof, but only with a specific mission.

Subsequently, falls, rebellion, and even deeply conscious and severe betrayal of God are not excluded, but blind failure is no longer possible, and the paralysis of spiritual understanding, which manifested itself in various epochs of Enrof in the psyche of those living there, changing its varieties, shades, and names, is forever excluded from the list of possibilities, especially in our era, although not exhaustively, it is determined as materialism.

If you try to find even a remote analogy to what you see in Fayr among familiar phenomena for everyone, you cannot stop at anything other than festive illumination. It goes without saying that the most magnificent of Enrof's illuminations are no more than a few of our lamps compared to the constellation Orion in comparison to Fayr.

I have seen many beings in their doubly and triply enlightened forms: they came here from higher layers, driven by the feeling of joy. The feeling of joy is inherent in the enlightened ones to an incomparably greater extent and strength than in us; every soul that has reached Fayr generates this exultant feeling in millions of those who have passed it before.

How to convey the state that engulfed me when I saw the multitudes of enlightened ones exulting because I, insignificant me, had reached this world? Not gratitude, not joyful embarrassment, not even shock—rather, it was like that blissful excitement when mortals in Enrof give in to uncontrollable and silent tears.

I do not remember the minutes and forms of transition to the next layer. The breathtaking experience of Fayr caused a deep exhaustion and as if softening of all the soul's tissues. And all I can now reconstruct from the experience of the next stage of ascent boils down to one state, but one that lasted very long, perhaps for years.

Radiant peace. Isn't that a contradictory phrase, one might think? With an abundance of light, we associate the idea of activity, not rest, of movement, not peace. But that's us, in Enrof.

It's not like that everywhere. And even the word "luchezarny" is not as precise as one would like it to be. Because the radiance of Nertisa is radiant and at the same time inexplicably soft; it combines the enchanting tenderness of our full moon nights with the shining lightness of high spring skies. As if lulled by something more tender than the quietest music, I dissolved into a happy doze, feeling like a child, after many months full of insults, sufferings, and undeserved bitterness, rocked on maternal knees. Feminine tenderness was permeating everything, even the air, but it was emanating with particular warmth from those who surrounded me, as if caring for the sick and tired with inexhaustible love. They were the ones who had risen to even higher layers before me and descended from there to Nertisa to create tenderness, love, and happiness for those like me.

Nertis is a country of great relaxation. Without any effort on my part, imperceptibly and subtly, only as a result of the efforts of my friends' hearts, my ethereal body slowly changed here, becoming lighter, imbued with spirit, and more obedient to my desires. It becomes like our body in the heavenly countries of metaculture, precisely in Nertis. And if someone close to me who remained in Enrof could see me, they would understand that it is me. They would perceive an indescribable resemblance between my new appearance and the one they knew, but they would be deeply moved by the otherworldly radiance of my transformation.

What has remained of the old me? My facial features? Yes, but now they shone with eternal, unearthly youth. My bodily organs? Yes, but two delicately blue flowers shone on my temples - these were organs of spiritual hearing. My forehead seemed adorned with a magical, sparkling gem - an organ of spiritual vision. The organ of deep memory located in the brain remained invisible. Likewise, the changes taking place in the internal organs of the body were also invisible because everything previously adapted to the tasks of nourishment and reproduction had been abolished or fundamentally changed to suit new tasks. Nourishment became similar to the act of breathing, and the replenishment of life force was achieved through the assimilation of the bright emanations of the stichials. However, reproduction, as we understand it, does not exist in any of the ascending worlds. There is something else, and I will talk about it when I get to the chapter on Heavenly Russia.

After a long time, I began to feel everything that was coming, a joyful increase in strength, as if the unfolding of mysterious and long-awaited wings. Don't understand me too literally: I'm not talking about the appearance of something resembling the wings of flying creatures of Enroth, but about the unfolding of the ability for unimpeded movement in all directions of four-dimensional space. It was still just a possibility - immobility still rested me, but the possibility of flight was turning from an undefined dream into an obvious one, opening up a perspective before me. My heart friends let me know that my stay in Nertis was coming to an end. It seemed to me that something like a cradle, where I rested, was slowly swaying up and down, and each takeoff seemed higher than the previous one. This movement created anticipation of even greater happiness, into which I must now enter. And I realized that I was already in another layer - in Gotimna, the last of the worlds of the Sakuala Enlightenment. They were like colossal flowers, the size of which did not deprive them of amazing tenderness, and between them, there were bottomless heights and the valleys of nine colors. About two of them, lying beyond our spectrum, I can only say that the impression produced by one of them is closest to that which the heavenly blue produces on us, and the impression of the other remotely resembles the impression that gold produces here.

The huge flowers of Gotimna, forming whole forests, lean and straighten, sway and rock, sounding in unimaginable rhythms, and their swaying is like the quietest music, never tiring and peaceful, like the sound of earthly forests, but full of inexhaustible meaning, warm love, and involvement in each of those who live there. With ease and calmness, unattainable for any creature in Enroth, we moved as if floating in any of the four directions of space between these singing flowers, or lingered, talking to them, because their language became understandable to us, and they understood us. Here, on the celestial blue glades or under the presentation of huge, quietly flickering golden petals, those who descend into Gotimna from the beyond visited us to prepare us, younger brothers, for the next stages of the journey.

The Garden of High Courts is called Gothimna, because it is here that the destinies of souls are predetermined for a long time. Before me appeared a crossroads: it is presented to everyone who has ascended to this level. Once chosen here, it could not be changed for many centuries in any of the many worlds preselected here. I was free to choose one of two options: either the ascent to Heavenly India, the end of the path of reincarnations forever, replaced by the path of ascending transformations through other immaterial layers; or one or even several existences in Enrof, but no longer as a result of unbound karma - it was untied - but as a means to carry out certain tasks entrusted only to me and freely accepted by me. And although the word "mission" in Russian sounds bookish and devoid of poetry, I will continue to use it to denote such special tasks assigned to individual souls to carry out in Enrof. The weight of responsibility for the one who took on the mission increases many times over, since the mission is always associated not only with the fate of its bearer, but also with the fate of many souls, both during life and after death, and sometimes with the fate of entire peoples and all of humanity. Those who voluntarily or because of weakness betray their mission will face retribution and redemption in the deepest and most terrible layers. This does not mean that those who have passed through the Garden of Enlightenment are immune to falls, betrayals, and ethical lapses on earth. Only a blind lapse based on ignorance of the existence of God is impossible; but that which slumbers at the bottom of the soul under the rays of Nertis and Gothimna can awaken in the darkness of Enrof's nights and lead the bearer of the mission astray or downward. If these falls do not affect the beings of his mission, Providential forces will lift him out of any abyss so that the mission can still be carried out. Before me opened the possibility of descending back into the boundaries of another metaculture, hitherto unknown and alien to me, still very young but with a great future. Something troubled, turbulent, and gloomy emanated from this huge, layered mass, vaguely perceived by me from afar. However, the task I had accepted had to do with the great task that went far beyond this metaculture and was obliged to encompass the world in the distant future. Already, thousands of souls were being prepared to participate in this task. And I chose this opportunity. I now understood that I had taken on such a burden that could no longer be cast off.

And from Gothimna India, I was transported to Gothimna Russia: there was where my preparation for carrying out the mission, accepted from above by my Self, was supposed to end. But falls, acts of rebellion and betrayal are possible even after bright lives, because then what has been dormant in the soul can awaken in the sunlight. There were such falls on my path already after Gothimna. However, this will have to be shed light on in some other chapters of the book. Now it's time to talk about zatomises, the heavenly lands of metaculture. But if I could speak of the sakual of Enlightenment as something experienced based on what I was able to remember, then the sakual of zatomises can only be stored in memory by rare fragmentary images, captured much later, during my transphysical travels, which took place in a state of sleep from here, from Enrof Russia. These vague images were supplemented by another invaluable source of knowledge - transphysical meetings and conversations. The autobiographical method is not applicable to presenting this material. And the following chapters will unfortunately be protocol and dry, similar to the chapter on the initial concept.

### Chapter 2. Zatomises

The peaks of metacultures, called zatomises, to some extent coincide with the geographical contours of the corresponding cultural zones of Enroth. The space of all zatomis is four-dimensional, but each of them is characterized by its own unique number of temporal coordinates. The materiality of this sakuala is created by one of the angelic hierarchies - the Dominions; the zatomis themselves are slowly constructed by the joint efforts of hierarchies, heroes, geniuses, righteous ones, and the widest masses capable of creativity, while the super-people who have advanced them continue their formation in history - and later, when their historical path is completed and millions of their immortal monads continue their ascent from one height of world knowledge and creativity to another.

The founder of each zatomis is one of the great human spirits. The panorama of these layers very remotely resembles our nature. Perhaps the elements of the earthly landscape closest to the landscape of the zatomis are the sky with clouds. Our oceans and seas correspond to zones of as if bright vapors, easily penetrable and shining: these are the souls of the sea elementals; their souls correspond to the rivers of Enroth, formations of indescribable beauty, which cannot even be hinted at in words as "shining mists." The vegetation is little like ours: these are the souls of elementals, which will be discussed later. For now, it seems to me enough to say that the souls of some elementals are located in the zatomis in the intervals between incarnations.

The change of day in these layers proceeds in exactly the same way as with us, being determined by the same rotation of the planet around its axis. The weather changes within the limits of pleasant and beautiful.

Higher humanity - synclites of metaculture - is our hope, our joy, support, and hope. Righteous ones, some lineagers and heroes enter here almost immediately after death in Enrof, quickly passing through the worlds of Enlightenment. About the overwhelming majority of such souls, no history will tell us: they passed in the depths of the people, leaving no trace in chronicles or legends - only in the memory of those who knew them or heard about them from living witnesses. These are the unnoticed heroes of our life; to think otherwise, that is, to imagine the synclites of metaculture as some kind of gathering of "celebrities", would mean proving that our moral-mystical mind is still sound asleep.

Others, especially carriers of special gifts, even those who fell into the depths of purgatory after death, rise from there by the power of the Light, shortening the terms of their redemptive purification, and enter the synclite. Not only other artistic geniuses but also more lineagers and heroes, and righteous ones - all of them have untied their karmic knots in Enrof, redeemed the burden of their guilt, and death was for them the wide-open gates of Zatomis.

For others, death caught them unprepared for higher stages, still burdened. Such ones have to first pass through a series of steps in the upper purgatories - upper in relation to the terrifying circles of magma and the earth's core, but lower in relation to us. Many thousands of such souls, finally reaching Gothimna, choose not new descents into Enrof but labor and great struggle in the brotherhoods of Zatomis.

The third group did not burden their souls with any falls in Enrof; on the contrary, but their horizons, the volume of their knowledge, and their sense of the cosmic, although grown after Olyrnia, are still not great enough. The path from Olyrnia meant for them the beginning of wandering, sometimes - long, even lasting centuries until they become capable of embracing the tasks and wisdom of the synclite. Thus, between the last death in Enrof and entry into the synclite, such souls do not redeem themselves but only expand and enrich themselves.

The path of reincarnation is not a universal law. However, the majority of monads still follow this path. They have already experienced a number of births in other nations of Enroth, in other meta-cultures, even in other millennia and on other ends of the earth, and before the human cycle, many of them passed through their path in other kingdoms of Shadanakar; their shells may have even towered over beings of the plant and animal kingdoms. Some knew incarnations in ancient times as titans, among primordial angels or daimons. The memory of this garland of births is stored in their deep memory; the volume of spiritual personality of such monads is particularly great, the abyss of memories is particularly deep, and their future wisdom is characterized by a special breadth. The carriers of the highest gift of artistic genius, which is dedicated to several chapters in another part of this book, all had a similar garland of incarnations behind them. And on the contrary: the righteous of the Christian meta-cultures, in contrast to the righteous of some Eastern meta-cultures, know, for the most part, another path of ascent: a path that leads to Enroth only once, but in travels through other layers, revealing before their eyes such heights of the world that the memory of it burns in their souls like a star, and its rays unravel all the darkness in their hearts during their only life in Enroth.

The activity of the Synclites is incredibly diverse and broad, and in many ways incomprehensible to us. I could point out three aspects of it: help - creativity - struggle.

Help - for everyone who has not yet reached Zatmisy. The angels of darkness, the masters of purgatory, would not release their victims for centuries and centuries if it were not for the uninterrupted efforts of the Synclites. The magmas and terrifying worlds of the earth's core would keep the sufferers until the third world period (only the first one is now coming to an end). The inhabitants of Enroth would be surrounded by an almost impenetrable armor of spiritual darkness if it were not for the Synclites.

But this work, freeing some, easing others, protecting third, enriching fourth, enlightening fifth, is only one aspect. The other side is the creation of autonomous values whose significance is enduring. However, for us, contemplation of the creations of the Synclites, let alone understanding them, is possible only to a minimal extent. The transmission of their meaning with the help of our concepts is completely excluded.

A third aspect of the activities of the Synclites is somewhat clearer - their struggle against demonic forces. One could say that they fight these forces physically, but of course, their weapons have no points of contact with Enroth's weapons. Their weaponry is diverse; it depends on their mastery of their own being and who it is directed against. However, its general principle is characterized by the concentration of volitional radiations that paralyze the enemy. Death in battle is impossible for the Synclite brothers. Another possibility is lengthy captivity in the depths of demonic fortresses in case of defeat.

The landscapes of Zatomis are complicated by some equivalent of cities, very few of which resemble our own, especially since there are no dwellings there in the strict sense of the word. The purpose of these structures is entirely special; they are primarily places of communication between the Synclite brothers and other worlds and the spirits of other hierarchies. Buildings where they engage in their highest forms of communication with the monads of elementals are called sheralthals. Nevertheless, in the architecture of Zatomis, one can discern styles that are familiar to us, but as if erected on incomparably higher levels. This is the result of parallel processes that are not easy to understand. It is difficult - but necessary - to understand.

The thing is, the beautiful architectural structures of Enroth, saturated with the radiations of many human psyches, acquire a soul, or rather an astral body, and such astral bodies reside in Zatomis. However, there are also structures in Zatomis that have no counterpart in Enroth, for example - the same sheralthals. There are also those that were grasped, understood by the creators of Enroth, and marked by them for embodiment on Earth, but history has put an insurmountable obstacle to this.

Brothers of the Synclites can descend into the worlds of the descending series all the way down to the magma, and ascend to very high levels, which are referred to as the Higher Aspects of the Transmuted Worlds of Religions. In each zatomis, the transformed language of the corresponding Enrof country prevails, which is not only a sound language, but also a light language. It is not at all strange to apply our concept of a vocabulary "fund" to these languages; it should be noted that this fund is very different from ours, accordingly having an incomparably richer stock of concepts. Along with these meta-culture languages, there is also a common language for all: the names of levels, beings, and hierarchies - from there. The speed and ease of learning different languages here cannot be compared to the corresponding process in Enrof: it happens effortlessly, naturally. The common language of the zatomis is commonly referred to as the language of the Synclite World, but this is not entirely accurate: the Synclite World, which is far ahead, knows such forms of communication that have nothing to do with any sound languages. However, descending from the heights into the zatomis of meta-cultures, the brothers of the Synclite World directed the creation of a unified language for the zatomis, and it is only for this reason that the conditional name of this language is associated with their name. In addition to the Synclites, other beings also inhabit the zatomis: the future angels. These are the most wonderful creations of God, and if we remember our legends of sirens and alkonosts, we will come closer to the idea of those whose presence adorns life in the zatomis of Byzantium and Russia: the idea of beings predetermined to become "solar archangels". In other zatomis, other beings also dwell, no less beautiful. So, I have come to a list of the zatomis. There are nineteen of them. Maif is the oldest of the zatomis, a heavenly country and a Synclite of the Atlantic meta-culture, which existed in Enrof approximately from the twelfth to the ninth millennium BC.

Atlantis was located on an archipelago of islands, the largest and most important of which in terms of size resembled Sicily. It was inhabited by a red race. It was a slaveholding society, initially consisting of several small states, later united into a despotism. Their worldview was polytheistic with a large layer of magic. The pantheon and cult were overshadowed by demonolatry. Of the cultures we know well, Atlantis would be closest to Egypt and partly to the Aztecs, but darker and heavier. Architecture, sculpture, and dance dominated the arts. The civilization cannot be called high, although the Atlanteans, using the presence of a chain of small islands between Atlantis and America, maintained a connection with this continent, from where they originated. Later they managed to reach West Africa, and the legend of Atlantis eventually reached Egypt through the ancient Sudanese civilization, which is now unknown, but traces of which can still be found in the future. The ethical beliefs of the Atlanteans were dominated by the images of merciless and greedy deities, and in the cult, ritual cannibalism played a significant role. In the late period, semi-esoteric religious movements of a bright nature emerged. But in general, the picture was quite bleak due to the great activity of demonic elements.

The main island and its surrounding smaller ones perished from a series of seismic catastrophes. Small groups of residents were saved in America, one in Africa, where they dissolved into the Negro population of Sudan. Now, Maif, existing for about fifteen thousand years over a certain zone of the Atlantic Ocean, has reached enormous power of Light.

Linat - the zatomis of the so-called Gondwana, if one understands by this name not that ancient continent that existed in the Indian Ocean long before humans, but a metaculture with centers in Java, Sumatra, Southern Indostan, and some cities that now lie at the bottom of the sea. The time of the existence of the Gondwanan culture was six or more thousand years before Christ.

This was a group of states - trading oligarchies based on slave ownership, and the highly developed navigation of Gondwana drew the coastal regions of the Indochinese Peninsula, Ceylon, and many islands of Indonesia into commercial and cultural exchange. Polytheism and, primarily, the same three arts prevailed; dance evolved into mystery theater. However, the bloodthirstiness and religious-demonic cruelty of the Atlanteans of Gondwana were unfamiliar. It was a sensual, sanguine, life-greedy people, richly endowed artistically, with a highly tense sexual sphere of life. The mystique of gender permeated both the cult and everyday life, reaching its peak of true splendor in the era of prosperity; neither Atlantis nor even Babylon and Egypt knew such luxury. The Gondwana race can, I think, be called proto-Malay. In any case, their brown skin tightly covered their broad cheekbones and full lips, their elongated eyes were slightly slanted, their figures were slender and muscular, with broad shoulders, a thin waist, and very strong calf muscles. The people were beautiful with the passionate beauty of the south.
Thousands of years later, in the same zone, the Indo-Malaysian culture emerged, repeating some of its predecessors, but much more spiritualized.

The emblematic image of Linat:
A woman in purple and a man in green, embracing each other by the shoulders, on a golden background, under the red lower half of the sun disk.

The purple color here signifies the merging of blue - the power of the world's femininity, which was first lowered with such force in the Gondwanan metaculture during the entire existence of humanity - with red, which symbolizes elementality, but not in the sense of the natural elements, but in the sense of extraordinary activity of some elemental beings connected with humanity. Green denotes the same power of activity of natural elemental beings. Gold is the hieratic background indicating a developed spiritual reality standing behind this superethnic group.

Ialu (whose name seems to be Athyam as well) is from the Ancient Egyptian metaculture. This culture, which completely overshadowed Atlantis with its scale and grandeur, created a huge synod and dazzling Ialu during its historical existence. However, the demonic forces managed to achieve a serious victory in the fourteenth century BC, when Providential forces made the first step towards enlightening the consciousness of the people by the reality of the One God through the great prophet and reformer Akhenaten. If Akhenaten's reform had succeeded and found worthy successors and continuers, the mission of Christ would have been accomplished several centuries earlier, not on the Jordan, but in the Nile Valley.

I would like to note that the Egyptian belief in the Heavenly Nile had a basis in the experience of the highest reality. The magnificent river flowing through Ialu - the mythical land of the Blessed, that is, through the Ialu of the metaculture - is multilayered: it is both the great spiritualized elemental of the earthly Nile and the Cathedral Ideal Soul of the Egyptian people.

Eanna is a zatomis of the ancient Babylonian-Assyrian-Canaanite metaculture, which apparently arose in the fourth millennium BCE. The seven-tiered temple observatories, which became the peaks and centers of the great cities of Mesopotamia, repeated in Enrof as reflections, the grand celestial city constructed by the synclite of this zatomis. However, the ziggurats in the cities of Babylon and the corporation of the high priestly hierarchy, while receiving the radiations of bright cosmic forces at these mystical observatories, were not protected from also accepting extremely active radiations from the galactic anti-Cosmos, the center of which coincides with the system of the star Antares in Enrof. This increasingly clouded the already ambiguous religion, infused a subtle poison into the nature of those who received it, and burdened their emotional composition with a weight of doubt and denial.

The Babylonian metaculture was the first in which Gagtunguru succeeded in achieving the embodiment of the powerful demonic creature, Wuicraor, in the underground four-dimensional layer adjacent to the Babylonian Shrastra, whose descendants played and continue to play a tremendous and extremely destructive role in the meta-history of humanity. To a significant extent, it was Wuicraor who was responsible for the overall spiritual damage that was observed in this culture in Enrof. And although the goddess of the underworld, Ereshkigal, was eventually overcome by the bright Astarte, who descended into the transphysical torments of Babylon in a burst of sacrificial love, pessimistic, almost nihilistic despair prevailed over the ideas of the afterlife of human souls, except for kings and priests: an intuitive understanding of the paralyzing power of demonic forces.

Shang-Chi is a zatomis of Chinese metaculture that has existed in Enroth from the second millennium BCE to the present day. Its significant growth began in the centuries before Christ when Confucianism created a long-lasting moral code and way of life that contributed to the improvement of the nation's ethical level. However, there was a low ceiling for the free development of the higher aspects of the soul. Gradually, the Confucian law became not only a means of ascent but also a hindrance, leading to the fact that the volume and strength of the Chinese metaculture, despite its antiquity, are not as great as one might expect. The spread of Buddhism spread a different metaculture across geographic China, coexisting with Shan-Ti and absorbing many more enlightened souls than the national Chinese metaculture did in recent centuries.

Sumera (or Meru) - I do not know which of these names is more correct.

The metaculture of the Indian metaculture is the most powerful of all the metacultures of Shadanakar. According to ancient mythology, the peak of Mount Sumera was crowned with the city of Brahma, and the slopes housed cities of other deities of Hinduism, but Heavenly India was not limited to their number and included several large areas of land divided by seas. Now, Heavenly India towers over the Enroth geographical zone, which is much wider than the boundaries of the Indian state. For four thousand years, the spiritual activity of exceptionally gifted people in religious terms in India has led to the fact that two metacultures separated from it, becoming independent systems of strata, and the Heavenly India itself was replenished with such a huge number of enlightened souls that in the 20th century, its syncretism outweighed the entire power of demonic elements. India turned out to be the only culture of Enroth, steadily developing along the path of high ethics. Even earlier, the power of the Indian syncretism prevented the creation by the forces of Gagtowngra, as they did in other metacultures, of strata of hopeless torment. Before Christ, this metaculture remained the only one with purgatories and did not reach its lower extremity to magma.

The mayor has two great centers: over the Himalayas and over the Nilgiri mountains in central India, as well as many smaller ones. In addition, the Indian synclite of Enroth has a strong point of support in the form of a certain fluid collective of people who epically move along a certain geographical curve: before the Second World War, it was located in the Pamirs, now it is in South India.

The landscape of Heavenly India is similar to that of Heavenly Russia, but the nature is more luxurious, reflecting the tropical character of Enroth's corresponding countries and the long duration of this zatomis. The Heavenly Ganges flows through the entire zatomis, and for Indian metaculture, it has the same double meaning as the Heavenly Nile for the Egyptians.

Zervan is the zatomis of ancient Iranian (Mazdean) metaculture. The insufficient clarity of the idea of monotheism in this, however, very elevated and pure religion did not allow the creation of a soil that was necessary for the mission of Christ to be carried out in Iran. The subsequent attempt of Iranian metaculture to make up for this failure by creating a new international religion - Manichaeism - ended in a secondary failure because the demonic involution gained access to the creative consciousness of its founders. By the time of the Muslim conquest, Iranian culture had exhausted its progressive movement. In the following centuries, the only point of support for it in Enroth was the Parsi community in India. Naturally, the number of those entering Zervan through the Worlds of Enlightenment now is extremely small, and Zervan itself has almost detached from the geographical zones of Enroth.

Olympus is the zatomis of ancient Greco-Roman metaculture.

This name refers to the center of Zatomis, the greatest city of the enlightened ones, truly associated with the geographic region of Mount Olympus and the entire heavenly country of Greco-Roman metaculture. In the historical era of Greece and Rome, it was the dwelling and arena of activity for those non-human hierarchies that were reflected in the images of the Greco-Roman pantheon. Over the millennia after Christ, this Zatomis gradually became the dwelling place of the synod. The hierarchies that once resided there have made a huge ascent over the centuries and now reside and act in incomparably higher worlds. At the same time, however, they oversee Olympus and actively envelop it in the synod.
Apollo is the name of the demiurge of Greco-Roman metaculture. Athena Pallada is the name of the Cathedral Ideal Soul of this super race.

Nikhord is the Zatomis of Jewish metaculture, the lower, only lower layer of the synod of Israel.

The founder of Nihord was the great human spirit Abraham. The ancient teachers of Judaism were involved with the demiurge of this super-race, but the purity of this involvement was hindered by the influence of the elemental forces associated with the "genius of the place" of Mount Sinai and then with the Jewish Uicraor. Nevertheless, the Most High should be seen as the essence of the biblical books. The monotheization was necessary for all humanity, like a soil without which Christ's task could not be fulfilled in Enroth. The introduction of the idea of monotheism into the consciousness of the people was achieved at the cost of a colossal strain on the forces that exhausted Nihord for a long time. Hence, the struggle with demonic forces is not always victorious, and the tragic nature of Jewish history. In the century that ended with the life and death of Jesus, this geographically small area was the arena of the most intense struggle between the forces of Gagtungre and the Divine forces. More on this will be said elsewhere. The resurrection of Christ was greeted in Nihord with great rejoicing: the attitude of the Jewish synod to the Planetary Logos is the same as in other zatomises - nothing else can be. But those who enter Nihord are waiting for the discovery of the truth of Christ, which they did not understand on earth - a stunning discovery that many cannot comprehend for a long time. The destruction of Jerusalem and the Jewish kingdom was reflected in Nihord by sorrow, but with an understanding of the logic of what had happened: with an aggressive but weak Jewish Uicraor, nothing else could happen after it entered into irreconcilable struggle with the demiurge of the super-race during the years of Christ's preaching on earth. After the final defeat of the Jews under Hadrian, there were no more Jewish Uicraors. But behind the Uicraor stood another, more terrible demonic hierarchy - the offspring of Gagtungre, the true opponent of the demiurge; he continued to influence Judaism even in the era of dispersion. Medieval Judaism continued to be formed under the influence of two polar influences: this demon and Nihord. Now Nihord is replenished with a very small number of new brothers who enter, however, precisely through Judaism into the worlds of Enlightenment. The restoration of the State of Israel in the 20th century has nothing to do with Nihord; the restored temple is a theatrical performance, nothing more.

No new Israeli Uitzraor has emerged, but a similar role is played by one of the beings that will be mentioned in the chapter on egregores; it is subjected to the strongest influence from the main breeding ground of demonic forces.

Geographically, Nihord is still associated with the region of Palestine.

Paradise is a conventional name for the Byzantine metaculture beyond. Like the other Christian metacultures beyond, it is one of the staircases leading from different sides to the extremely high world called Heavenly Jerusalem: it is nothing but the Highest Aspect of the Christian Transmyth; the question about it will be illuminated a little later.
Paradise is an ancient, powerful layer that exists partly over Russia. Its founder was the great human spirit who was John the Baptist in Enrofe.

The victory of Jesus Christ, although only partially realized, aroused enormous excitement in the demonic worlds. In particular, their efforts were directed to prevent the transformation of the sufferings of the Byzantine metaculture into temporary purgatories. These efforts were successful, but ultimately, the Byzantine culture in Enrofe fell victim to them. The absence of purgatories and the inevitable descent of sinners into hopeless torments of magma and the Core caused that stable feeling of horror before the slightest sin, which was characteristic of the most gifted spiritual people of Byzantium; to a significant extent, it led to the extreme asceticism.
The Slavic peoples are metahistorically located in the intermediate area between the Byzantine, Russian, Roman Catholic, and Muslim metacultures. Their synclites are in Paradise.

Eden is a symbolic name for the zatomis of the Roman Catholic metaculture, which is one of the stairs leading to the Heavenly Jerusalem. Several peoples of different ethnic origins belong to this metaculture, including Poles, Hungarians, Czechs, Irish, and Croats.

The founder of Eden is a great spiritual leader who was once an apostle Peter in Enroth. The emblematic image is the same as that of Paradise, but the predominant color is blue. Blue represents the greater permeation of Catholicism with the principles of World Femininity.

Montsalvat is the zatomis of the metaculture of European Northwest, American North, as well as Australia and some parts of Africa, the most geographically extensive and segmented of all the zatomises. The founder of Montsalvat is the great spiritual leader Titurrel, who was associated with Christ long before the Savior was incarnated in Palestine. Like Loengrin and Parsifal, he is not a legendary hero, but a real person who once existed in Enroth (although not in Palestine).

The Grail contains the etheric blood of Christ shed by Him on Golgotha. The differentiation of the layers of Eden and Montsalvat is mainly based on national and cultural differences between Romance and Germanic peoples. However, the religious or secular nature of human activity has added many corrections to the afterlife destinies of Western Europeans, especially since Montsalvat arose several centuries later than Eden.

France is in an intermediate position, and its tragedy is that it has no synclite of its own. Some of the ascending monads rose from France in their afterlife to Eden, while others rose to Montsalvat.

The Monsalvat Center, previously connected to the Alpine system, moved far to the East in the late Middle Ages and is now connected to the Pamirs (the reasons for this are very complex). But there are many other smaller metacities shining over Europe and America. Some of them tower over physically small but spiritually powerful Enroth centers like Heidelberg, Cambridge, and Weimar.

Junfleia is a subset of the Ethiopian metaculture, which existed for two thousand years in extremely unfavorable historical and geographic conditions, like an island of Christianity between two hostile oceans - Islam and primitive paganism of the Negro tribes. This metaculture was unable to realize even one-tenth of its potential. Now there is a painful meta-historical process going on - Junfleia is moving to another sakuala: the sakuala of metacultures tragically unfinished in Enroth. With an exceptionally fortunate combination of historical circumstances, this process can still be reversed.

Symbolic image:
A white round building in billowing veils. Meaning: the building is a subset, the veils are thin and delicate materialities.

Giannet is a subset of Muslim metaculture. Unlike other world religions, Islam lacks the highest aspect of transmyth, meaning that in the extremely high sakuals of the highest transmyths of world religions, there is no world specifically connected with Islam. This has led to the poverty of Muslim mythology and the lack of independence of most of its developed transphysical images and plots, primarily drawn from Judaism and Christianity. Representing in many ways a regression in relation to Christianity, Islam nevertheless gives the soul the opportunity for upward movement, promotes the influx of spiritual forces into life, and over the period of its historical existence has created a not so powerful, but still very bright subset and shining synclite.

Sukhavati is the "Western Pure Land of Amitabha Buddha," a subculture associated with Northern Buddhism, specifically Mahayana. It dominates over Tibet and Mongolia, and coexists with Shangri-La and the Japanese national subculture of Nikisaka in Japan and China. Sukhavati separated from its parent Indian subculture in the 9th century, when the centers of Buddhism definitively shifted from India to Tibet and China. It particularly flourished three to four centuries later when the brilliant Himalayan subculture began to decline prematurely and the leading role was established in the Tibetan-Chinese centers of Buddhism. Sukhavati subculture is one of the most populous and powerful. It is one of two stairs to the high world of the "Highest Aspect of Buddhist Transmifa," which is called Nirvana and which we will talk about later. Emblematic image: Dawn over lotuses. Aireng-Dalyang is a subculture of the little-known Indo-Malayan subculture in Russia. Separating from the Indian subculture around the 5th century, it covered the Brahman-Buddhist kingdoms of Java, Indochinese peninsula, and Ceylon. It was historically expressed in the empire of Sailendra, which united this territory, but was later sharply weakened by the separation of Java, which fell to Islam, and in the late 19th century by the predatory demons of Europe. Now it still thrives in Indochinese kingdoms, but a favorable historical climate could bring about its new flowering. Emblematic image: Laughing children in the garden of the temple palace. Heavenly Russia - more will be said about this subculture than others in a few lines below.

This is about the Negroid metaculture. Unfortunately, I know almost nothing about it, not even its name. What is known is that it is young and very weak.

After the collapse of Sudanese culture with its religion, which allowed for the degradation of spirituality not only among the elites but even among the masses of Negro peoples in Equatorial Africa, the Negroes lost the opportunity for ascending afterlife for a long time. It began to open up to them only a few centuries ago in connection with the fact that some tribes reached the stage where vague polytheistic systems became available to accommodate the first manifestations of spirituality. Even more so, ascending afterlife was opened to Negro peoples with the spread — unfortunately, weak — of Islam and Christianity. The meta-historical significance was also in the fact of the formation of Liberia, which created a small but firmly protected center of Christian spirituality in Equatorial Africa. The Negro zatomis is also associated with the Negro population of America. Representatives of the white race ascend to this zatomis only as a rare exception. Harriet Beecher Stowe, for example, having reached Monsalvat, withdrew from there to the Negro zatomis, where her activities had great significance for a long time, and her position was partly similar to that of a queen, partly similar to that of the head of the priesthood.

Orange color is the intersection of solar gold with the alost of those elementals that are associated not with the kingdoms of nature, but with humanity.

The last of the great zatomis is in a state of creation. This is Arimoya, the future zatomis of universal metaculture, associated with the emergence and dominance of the forthcoming Interreligious Rose of the World. The materiality of Arimoya, like that of other zatomis, is created by one of the angelic hierarchies — Dominions; the great human spirit, who was last incarnated on earth as Zoroaster, is leading the creation of what I will tentatively call the "great design".

Emblematic image:

A white multi-towered cathedral, with a central main tower, colonnades, and stairs, surrounded by a row of huge stringed instruments resembling golden lyres. Meaning: towers are the zatomis of humanity, the central tower is Arimoya; colonnades are the worlds of demons, angels, elementals, enlightened animals; lyres are all the peoples of the globe.

Heavenly Russia. Emblematic image: a multi-dome pink and white city on a high bank above a blue river channel. Like the other zatomises, Heavenly Russia, or Holy Russia, is connected to the geography of the three-dimensional layer, roughly coinciding with the outlines of our country. Some of our cities correspond to its great centers; between them are regions of enlightened beauty of nature. The largest of the centers is the Heavenly Kremlin, towering over Moscow. Its sanctuaries sparkle with unearthly gold and unearthly whiteness. And high in the clouds of the meta-Petersburg, there rises a grand white statue of a galloping rider. This is not someone's personal image, but an emblem expressing the direction of the meta-historical path. Smaller centers are scattered throughout the zatomis, including the meta-cultural peaks of other nations that, together with the Russians, form a single super-people. Here reside synclites of Ukraine, Georgia, Armenia; and now a synclite of the people of Bolarus is beginning to join this zatomis along with their heavenly cities. The total number of inhabitants of Heavenly Russia is unknown to me, but I know that about half a million enlightened beings are now in the Heavenly Kremlin. The Demiurge Yarosvet manifests himself in the sky and air of this world as if a transparent ocean of power passed from one firmament to another and filled hearts. This power is concentrated in the temples of the Demiurge, his image is outlined, his voice becomes clear, and communication arises between him and the enlightened ones - communication that gives them strength and higher wisdom. Another hierarchy, similar to the Demiurge, is also manifested - the great spirits of the national leaders of separate nations that are part of our meta-culture. Among them are those that are more ancient than the fall: the Narrow Path was denied as such. Muhammad, dying, denied the existence of the Ideal Cathedral Soul of the Russian people, and her sisters - the cathedral souls of other peoples - are still not here: captured in the blocks of statism, in the citadels of the great-power demon, Uicraora, in the underground world of Russian anti-humanity, they reach Heavenly Russia only with distant sounds, weakened reflections.

The glowing seas of aether are the souls of elementals, shining with colors that are unimaginable to us. They wash around structures that could remotely be likened to the vastness of azure and white mountains. The Russian church sings about this world when it accompanies the newly deceased on their journey to the irrevocable path, so that the Lord may rest them in a "bright place, a luxurious place, a peaceful place, where there is neither sorrow nor sighing, but infinite life."

Newcomers arrive in Heavenly Russia in special sanctuaries, having the appearance of not infants, but already children. The condition of the newcomers is similar to that of childhood, but the change in age is replaced by an increase in enlightenment and spiritual power. There is no conception or birth. Receivers, not parents, prepare the necessary conditions for the enlightened soul ascending here from Gotimna. In the forms of some of the brothers of the synclite, one could guess features familiar to us from the time of their life in Enroth. Now these features are radiant, dazzling; they shine with spiritual glory, thin and light. Their clothing glows by the transformed body itself. They can move in all four directions of space without prohibition; it remotely resembles the flight of birds, but surpasses it in lightness, freedom, and speed. There are no wings. The perception of the enlightened is accessible to many layers: descending - purgatories, magma, the terrible Gasharva; ascending - the worlds of Enlightenment, the circles of angels, demons and elementals, the worlds of involutions of other Bramfatur, the worlds of the Higher Aspects of World Transmutes. They enter dark shrouds - the worlds of anti-humanity, the inhabitants of which see them but are powerless to kill them; they also enter our Enroth, but people can only perceive them with spiritual sight.

The love between a man and a woman in Enroth that is worthy of being called great continues here, freed from all burdens, grown and deepened. Some have physical intimacy, but it is completely detached from the task of continuing the race and has nothing in common with physical intimacy in Enroth. Many organs of the body have completely changed their structure, purpose, and meaning here, including organs related to the intake and absorption of food, because the process of restoring vitality here is similar to breathing. The increase in spirituality gradually leads the enlightened individual to the next great transformation of the body, which leads to higher worlds, to the Heavenly Jerusalem and even higher - up to the World Synclite and the Elite of Shadanakar.

There is nothing in Zatomi that resembles our technology; it has been replaced by something that is extremely difficult to understand. However, it can be noted that the principle is not in the creation of mechanical devices made of foreign matter, but in the development of the diverse abilities of one's own being. Only that which is somewhat comparable to our spatial arts is created here from foreign matter.

Everywhere in Zatomi, there are shining souls of the churches that existed or were supposed to be built by us. Many temples have, however, purposes that are difficult for us to understand. There are sanctuaries for communicating with angels, the Synclite of the World, demons, and supreme hierarchies. Several great temples are designed for meetings with Jesus Christ, who occasionally comes here, taking on a visible, human-like form, and others are for meetings with the Mother of God. Now, the greatest temple is being built there; it is intended to become the abode of that Great Feminine Spirit, who will take on astral and etheric flesh from the marriage of the Russian Demiurge with the Ideal Cathedral Soul of Russia. Since childhood, I have been accustomed to calling this temple the Temple of the Sun of the World, but this name is incorrect. It is properly attributed to another even more grandiose structure, the one planned to be created in Arimoy. The temple being built in the Heavenly Kremlin is called the abode of Zventy-Sventana, and later I will explain what this name means. This great Feminine Entity has now become one of the highest beings in Shadanakar. In Enrof, she will never take on flesh, but she will be born in Heavenly Russia, assuming a human-like form - not our queen or goddess, but rather light, grace, and divine beauty.

The ladder of wonderful, translucent worlds rises from the altar in the Temple of Femininity, in the temples of Christ, in the temples of the Demiurge Yarosvet. The ladder rises to the Heavenly Jerusalem and finally to the threshold of the World Savior.

At times, great human spirits are born in Heavenly Russia - those who have completed their journey in Shadanakar, reaching its highest worlds and now co-create with the Planetary Logos. For the sake of helping those below, they leave the Elite of Shadanakar and, carrying out missions that even the highest mystical human intelligence is incapable of comprehending, descend here to the lower worlds. They take on the same enlightened bodies as their synclite brothers, but surpass them immeasurably in the speed of their entry into the fullness of spiritual power and the scope of their Self. Their paths in the lower worlds resemble those of geniuses among the rest of humanity, but synclites are forewarned of their births and await them with joy and exultation.

Those who were geniuses and messengers on Earth continue their creativity here in the lower worlds after redemption, enlightenment, and transformation. The bliss of the gamayuns and sirin birds themselves grows as they witness the epic deeds that great souls, who last walked the earth in the forms of Derzhavin and Pushkin, Lermontov and Gogol, Tolstoy and Dostoevsky, Rublev and Surikov, Glinka and Mussorgsky, Kazakov and Bazhenov, create there. Glowing waves of unimaginable sounds soar in places as if from the heart of the celestial mountains: they establish the soul in a state of such spiritual bliss that an earthly heart would burst from it, and, rising and changing, like praising clouds, descend in love and the quietest joy.

The great architect, who once undertook to build the Temple of Body, Soul, and Spirit in Moscow on the Vorobyovy Hills, experiencing the collapse of his plan, exile, oblivion, and poverty, now creates the highest in the Heavenly Kremlin: the inner precincts in the abode of Zventy-Sventana.

However, among the enlightened of Heavenly Russia, only a negligible minority is known to us, familiar with the history of our homeland. The names of the others will tell nothing to our memory.

In the monasteries of Kievan and Muscovite Rus', as well as in later religious communities, lived quiet souls who, though not recognized as saints, quietly and humbly contributed to the religious creativity and spiritual work of the cathedrals. Throughout the ages, there were wanderers, seekers, storytellers, and musicians who created untold tales and spiritual songs, legends, and stories about the heroes of their time and their ideals. Skilled artisans of carvings, icons, and building magnificent wooden churches and painted houses, passionate masons, carpenters, potters, weavers, jewelers, and scribes, all worked in workshops, monasteries, and under the open sky, creating works of joy, creativity, and love for life that brought happiness to generations. Where are these creators now, and what can they create if not the eternal values of Holy Rus'?

Throughout Russian history, thousands of peasants, both serfs and freemen, lived simple and pure lives, tending to their crops and reaping their harvest with reverence and gratitude to Mother Earth, dying believing and forgiving all. In all these epochs, thousands of mothers carried their cross, raising people worthy of the name "human," and devoted their lives to this calling. Is this not one of the highest forms of creativity?

When schools began to be built, hundreds of people left their familiar circles and ways of life and descended into the depths of rural areas, among the unenlightened, where there was no one to exchange words with, all for the sake of educating the uneducated.

And what of the doctors who worked alone in whole districts? What of the hero-doctors during epidemics? What of the revolutionaries who were not driven by fanaticism, hatred, and a thirst for power, but by a living love for people and grief at the sight of the people's sorrows? And what of those priests who, given the gifts of God, lived a clear and pure life and nurtured the best of what was in the hearts of the people?

There is no way to enumerate all the paths on earth that a wanderer may take to eventually reach the synod. The question is only about time and the stages that still need to be overcome on the way to this goal. The goal is not fully manifested in a person's consciousness, but it is known by their immortal monad and draws them towards it.

Oh, it is in vain to imagine Heavenly Rus as endless, uniformly strict services and prayers. There are spiritual delights there of which we have no idea; there are jokes and laughter, and even games, especially among their children. I could name several figures of Russian culture and history who entered Heavenly Russia in the last forty years.

Let those who want to laugh at this message do so. And I am used to being considered crazy. So, here are the names of some of those who did not experience a descending after-death and immediately entered the synchlet through the worlds of Enlightenment: Leskov, Rimsky-Korsakov, Klyuchevsky, Gumilev, Voloshin, Rachmaninoff, Anna Pavlova, Sergei Bulgakov, Ioann Kronstadt, Patriarch Tikhon, Tsarevich Alexei Nikolaevich, several creators and thousands of heroes who died at the hands of Stalin. Very few of those who entered the synchlet after a short stay in the upper purgatories: Fet, L. Andreev, Alexander Blok, Shalyapin, Alexander II, Konstantin Romanov, Academician Pavlov.

From the number of the enlightened who ascended to Heavenly Russia to a special height, I know several names: Pushkin, Lermontov, Gogol, Leo Tolstoy, Alexei Konst. Tolstoy, Dostoevsky, Aksakovs, Vitberg, Kutuzov, the little-known and early deceased engraver of the XVIII century, Chemezov.

Of those who approached closest to the great transformation leading to Heavenly Jerusalem and the Synchlet of the World, the following names are of the present time: Lermontov, Vladimir Solovyov, Emperor Ioann VI, as well as two spirits whose names surprised me but were firmly pronounced twice: Shevchenko and Pavel Florensky.

Throughout the existence of Russian purgatory, several dozen people have ascended through it to the Synchlet of the World, of which I know the following names: Vladimir the Saint, Yaroslav the Wise, Anthony and Theodosius of the Caves, chronicler Nestor, warrior Sergei - author of "The Tale of Igor's Campaign," Alexander Nevsky, Sergei Radonezhsky, Andrei Rublev, Nil Sorsky, Lomonosov, Alexander the Blessed, Ambrose of Optina, Seraphim of Sarov.

Sight that breaks the shackles of our space discerns, in the distance beyond the sphere of Russian metaculture, the celestial lands of other metacultures, which are just as radiant and full of unique character.

Preparation in love and understanding for the creation of the celestial land of all humanity, the sacred Arimoya, is the bond that connects the synclites and cities of metacultures. The greatest of humanity's children, having completed their creations in their sacred cities, go beyond the metacultural boundaries. Rising to the Synclite of the World from different sides, they finally meet long before they reach it. The world of their meeting is the Gridrutva, the white palace where they create the common plan for humanity's ascent. Further ascent brings them to layers where their wisdom and power surpass those of the demiurges. The highest providential plan, which we can sometimes discern throughout history behind the demiurges' private plans, is a reflection of their creative work. This is the Synclite of the World. It is co-created, in all the clarity of spiritual consciousness, by the Planetary Logos.

Arimoya has only recently begun to be created in four-dimensional worlds, and its historical reflection on Earth will be the meaning and purpose of the coming century. For this reason, the descent of the forces of the Prisnodevi-Mother from transcosmic spheres to higher layers of Shadanakar was accomplished - forces concentrated in one divine monad. For this reason, an unprecedented temple is being built in Heavenly Russia to receive Her, whose birth in four-dimensional worlds is the goal and meaning of the forthcoming marriage of the Russian Demiurge and the Cathedral Soul. Historically, the transformation of the statehood of all peoples into the brotherhood of all will begin through the realization of this great Feminine Spirit in the Rose of the World. All synclites of metacultures help and will continue to help the Russian synclite, and the Synclite of the World will receive from them and continue their work to complete it with universal theanthropy.

However, in addition to the great zatomis counted by the number 19, there is another sakuala of zatomis in Shadanakar: these are the zatomis of metacultures tragically unfinished in Enroth. If it becomes clear that the providential forces of this metaculture cannot withstand the pressure of demonic elements, its zatomis is moved to a layer of this sakuala. Its cultural, and sometimes state formations in Enroth gradually dissolve into the common human environment, its witzraor perish, its underground shrastries languish in painful existence, gradually degenerating; but zatomis continues its development, and synclit continues to create and strengthen its creativity. The souls of such a metaculture, not yet reaching the level at which zatomis becomes open to them, can pass stages of necessary improvement outside Enroth or undergo incarnations in other metacultures and countries, but eventually reach their own zatomis. There are also cases when the cultural-historical basis in Enroth still continues, gradually declining, its existence, and zatomis maintains an active connection and assistance to it. In such cases, it is still possible, under favorable conditions, for zatomis to return to its previous sakuala, and the super-people to historical life. Something similar is happening now with Zhunfleya, which I have already mentioned. I must briefly list the fifteen zatomis of this second sakuala.

Nambata is the zatomis of the Ancient Sudanese metaculture, which developed very slowly in extremely unfavorable conditions, or rather languished in the Niger valley, in the region of Lake Chad and in Cordofan from the ninth to the fifth millennium BC. It perished from centrifugal forces that exhausted it with endless civil wars. The first attempt in the history of mankind to cement antagonistic and ethnographically diverse nationalities with a common international religion (of course, polytheistic) failed due to the strong demonic influence through the very ambivalent pantheon of the same religion. Archaeological remains of this culture can still be found.

Cent-Tin was part of the Proto-Mongoloid meta-culture, not in an ethnographic sense, but in a territorial sense. Its people belonged to the yellow race, but anthropologically and spiritually were closer to the people of Gondwana than to later Mongolia. They inhabited Northern China and the Amur region in the 4th-3rd millennium BC and transitioned from a nomadic to a sedentary way of life. Small cities had already emerged.
The beginning of this culture was remarkable. The leading hierarchy was not a demiurge of the super-people, but a mighty demonic entity that had to turn to and was already turning towards the Light. It was destroyed by Gagtungar, and the super-people were crushed by hordes that swept in from Central Asia.

Pre-Valmiki is part of the Dravidian meta-culture, determined by this term loosely, as it included peoples of various ethnic origins, including those close to the Sumerians. Late formations of this meta-culture include the cities of Mohenjo-Daro and Harappa. The catastrophe (in the early 2nd millennium BC) was the result of both internal reasons (which are unclear to me) and external reasons: the invasion of Aryans.

It is possible not to dwell on the fact that this culture perished in Enrofe, as the influence of demonic elements was very strong in it.^^1 Emblematic image: A stone statue of a sitting puma.

Bon is a zatomi of the ancient Tibetan culture, destroyed by Buddhism, but whose elements have organically entered into Mahayana culture. Emblematic image: Red and blue lightning crossing over an orange tent of a king. Meaning: Blue lightning - Buddhism with its spirituality, red - pre-Buddhist, heavily poisoned by demonism, Tibetan religion. The tent represents royal power, which eventually perishes as a result of the intersection of these two forces.

Gauripur is a zatomi of the small Himalayan metaculture that separated from India too early, but had immense potential. It was here that the brightest centers of Buddhism were once kindled; here, in the womb of this teaching, the meta-historical processes flowed that created a religion in the full sense of the word, that is, a doctrine that is not only moral but also trans-physical and spiritual. The moral side of Buddhism rose in the Himalayas to a level that is familiar only to the purest examples of Christianity. The Himalayan metaculture perished under pressure from demons on two sides: the Turkic witzraors from the north and west and the witzraors of the Great Mughal Empire from the south. Now this metaculture is completely dying out in Nepal. Emblematic image: A crowned mountain peak under the constellation of Orion.

Yunkif is a zatomi of the Mongolian metaculture, which immediately became the prey of an extraordinarily powerful witzraor. The catastrophe occurred in the thirteenth century. Emblematic image: A wavy line of hills, and above it, a battle between two flocks, white and red.

Yiru is a zatomis of the Ancient Australian metaculture that existed for two thousand years in complete isolation from the rest of humanity in Central Australia. The society evolved into a slave-owning formation. The metaculture perished due to the extraordinary activity of demonic styhials - spirits of the deserts and impenetrable thickets. For many centuries, two religions - "right-hand and left-hand" - fought in the culture: polytheistic and demonic. The latter sacrificed humans to those angry styhials that destroyed the metaculture. In the end, this religion prevailed, and the struggle against the desert and bushes was declared a sin. The culture in Enrof died out due to internal drying up. Painting was the most developed art form. It resembled to some extent the Cretan style but was more interesting and vivid. The remnants of the civilization that will be discovered will not allow to reconstruct the picture due to their insignificance.

Nikisaka is the zatomis of the Japanese metaculture, heavily wounded twice: by Buddhism and Europeanization, and unable to fulfill its potential. Shintoism essentially worships Nikisaka as a Japanese syncretism; the goddess Amaterasu, in the correct understanding of this image, is nothing other than the nation of Japan. The process of moving Nikisaka to the tragically unfinished sakualu in the Enroth metaculture is happening now. The Rose of the World can significantly help strengthen this zatomis: its return is still entirely possible.

### Chapter 3. The Middle Layers of Shadanakar

Before attempting to draw a panorama of the demonic sakuals, which hold such colossal significance for the transphysics and meta-history of Shadanakar, as well as the sakuals of elementaley, some of which are closely related to demonic beginnings, it is advisable to give an idea of several ascending sakuals, as if following the sakuals of zatomis. These sakuals are very diverse, but together they make up the middle layers of Shadanakar.

Naturally, the higher the layers are located hierarchically, the more difficult they are to understand, the fewer analogies with Enroth can be found in their landscapes, in the appearance and form of the beings that inhabit them, and in the content of their lives. Nine-tenths of what is seen or perceived remains incomprehensible, and in most cases, one has to limit oneself to protocol messages about elementary facts, without trying to uncover their regularities or their profound meaning.

Therefore, this chapter promises the reader almost nothing except for a dry list of several sakuals and the layers they make up.

I remember, for example, that in the mysticism of Judaism, the concept of "egregores" is featured. However, it is difficult for me to judge how accurately this term coincides with the content that is invested in it here, at least because of my more than superficial acquaintance with Jewish theosophems. In any case, here egregores are understood as immaterial formations that arise from certain psychic emissions of humanity over large collectives. Egregores are devoid of spiritual monads, but possess temporarily concentrated volitional charge and an equivalent of consciousness. Every state has its own egregore, even Luxembourg. These beings are mostly static and non-aggressive. In the struggle between the demonic and Providence forces of Shadanakar, most egregores do not participate, although there are some that are affiliated with the demonic state.

With the disintegration of egregores, their consciousness equivalents also disappear, dissipating in space. This is not experienced by them as suffering.

Since we can speak about the landscape of these layers, yellowish swirling spaces are characteristic of the Sakuala egregores, in which the egregores appear somewhat denser than the surrounding environment. The seven layers that make up this Sakuala can be listed in the following sequence:

Zativ - the egregores of the initial tribes that die out along with the dissolution of the tribe into a nation or with its physical destruction. Here are also the egregores of the oldest cultural and state formations of humanity, now scattered in space.

Zhag - the region of state egregores. In addition, the egregores of some large contemporary socio-political formations, such as the Indian National Congress party, are located here.

Foraun - the egregores of churches. They are formed from those dark etheric emanations of the human multitude associated with churches, which are introduced by anyone whose soul has not reached righteousness, mixing with their religious states: from worldly thoughts, material interests, acquisition, passionate states - generally from what the fathers of the church called "worldly care." These egregores often become a big obstacle, a burden on the ascending path of churches. Over time, there will be an egregore of the Rose of the World in Foraun: this is inevitable, since the interreligious church of the future will be composed not only of saints, but also of hundreds of millions of people at different stages of the path.

Udgrog - the egregores of anti-church, mass militant parties of the new era.

The layer whose name is unknown to me is inhabited by egregores generated by the psychic activity of the demonic population of shrastri. Similarly, I do not know the name of the layer belonging to the egregores arising from the psychic activity of the world of demons - the same second, brighter humanity, which will be discussed in a few words on the page below.

The last of the egregorial layers is called Cebumr. It is still empty. Over time, there will be an egregore of the impending anti-church here, in which the demonic quasi-religion of worshiping Gagtung will be realized - the core and basis of the impending (at the end of the first eon) devil-humanity.

In a sakual composed of three to four spatial layers with a huge number of temporal coordinates, there lives another, higher humanity of Shadanakar. Unfortunately, my knowledge of it is extremely limited. Many questions that arise when thinking about it remain a wide gap in my broken panorama of Shadanakar. This humanity is called Daimons. It follows a path of development similar to ours, but its beginning was much earlier and more successful. Apparently, the determining factor in this was that the mission of Jesus Christ, which was cut short by the efforts of Gagtung in Enrof and marked only by partial victory, was completely accomplished in the world of Daimons. Chronologically, this happened much earlier than when Christ became incarnate in the form of Jesus. His victory in the world of Daimons removed the heaviest obstacles piled up by Gagtung on their ascending path, and by now, these beings have far surpassed us. The times and sacrifices of their development were reduced by many times. There have been no phenomena of social disharmony among them for a long time, and their forces are directed towards spiritual and aesthetic perfection and towards helping other layers, in particular, the humanity of Enrof.

Daimons are winged beings, partly resembling angels in appearance, but different from them, among many other things, by the presence of two sexes. The main layer of their existence, corresponding to our Enrof, is called Jeram. The nature, similar to ours, has been brought there to a level of high artistic and aesthetic perfection, and the machine civilization is spiritualized by inner wisdom about the powers and layers of Shadanakar and the development of higher abilities in their own being. Daimons know all the essential things about the humanity of Enrof.

Since the completion of Christ's task in Jeram, Daimons have been freed from postmortem descents into demonic worlds of retribution. And the multi-layered sakual of purgatory, which is experimentally known but forgotten by most of us, is replaced for them by a single layer named Urm, where some of them undergo purifying purification in the afterlife. A parallel to our humanity is formed for them by Kartiala, the world of enlightened Daimons, their heavenly country. From there, the ascent to the sakual of High Duty and, finally, to the Synclite of the World is revealed.

Among the many tasks facing the daimons of Kartyala in relation to other worlds of Shadanakar, one is their active participation in the struggle against uitzraors and anti-humanity shrastras; another is their inspiring, creatively guiding influence on the creators of our artistic culture. Testimony to genuine transphysical facts, rather than poetic techniques, are the appeals of some poets to their inspirers - daimons, and of others - to their muses. I do not know if there were nine sisters of Apollo in the Olympus of that time - it is quite possible - but it is beyond doubt that daimons of a feminine nature, muses, or of a masculine nature - Socratic daimons in the narrow sense of the word - contributed to the revelation of the creative depths in the personalities of our artists and thinkers. Only materialistic blindness can make one pass by countless testimonies of this fact from our poets, writers, musicians, philosophers, starting with Socrates and even earlier, and ending with Gogol and Alexander Blok. Most inspiring daimons, having fulfilled their task, depart from those they inspired. Sometimes there is a duality - a phenomenon that is extremely rare and very difficult to explain. There are also cases where human shelters incorporate one embodiment in the world of daimons into their garland. Such an embodiment is given to them in order to consolidate the bright achievements of the soul.

But in the sakuala of daimons, there is also another race, smaller in number, lagging behind in their development and somehow protected by them. The history of their appearance in these worlds is not entirely clear to me; it seems that these are the same daimons that once went astray in ancient times, lost their wings and compensate for the damage inflicted upon themselves on the road of a peculiar redemption. These wingless creatures are almost indistinguishable from humans. Here I come to a fact that will inevitably provoke denial and even indignation in almost every reader of this book. But if we cannot discard words from a song, we cannot discard thoughts from this book. So, those creatures about which I spoke as a lower race of daimons can partly be defined as the archetypes of some heroes of the world literature and art of Enroth. Sometimes, the intuition of the Enroth artists, inherent only to geniuses, perceives in Jheram, contemplates any of these creatures and leads to the creation of its reflection in human art. This reflection becomes like a magical crystal that concentrates the emanations of people that arise during hours of creative perception. These emanations, rising to Jheram, give the archetype the strength to develop. If such a reflection is not created, the development slows down, and in some cases, the archetype may even have to leave the sakuala of daimons and start a slow path in Enroth. Most of the painted and sculpted portraits created in our world are devoid of archetypes: they are portraits of people, no more. But works like, for example, the Mona Lisa, in addition to their human prototype, are precisely associated with the archetypes from Jheram, apprehended by the genius intuition. Hence the extraordinary significance of these masterpieces and their power of influence. It is regrettable that the Mona Lisa was created by Leonardo in such a way that the archetype was lowered, and the portrait included some elements from Duggur - one of the worlds of demonic elementals, as a result of which the archetype suffered a fall from Jheram to Urm because this layer plays the role of purgatory not only for daimons but also for archetypes. Raised by Leonardo, with his posthumous works, Pra-Mona Lisa is now in one of the layers of High Duty. The Venus de Milo is already in Synclite Mira, as the soul of a Greek woman who served as a model for the sculptor in Enroth for this statue, after the historical end of Greco-Roman culture in Enroth, rose through Olympus and precisely to Kartialu Diamonds, where it reunited with its metaprotoform and ascended the staircase to the highest levels. The same will happen in due time with all souls of similar metaportraits.

The situation with works of painting in the genres of mythology, psychology, history, and everyday life is even more complex and diverse. Surikov's Boyarynya Morozova had a metaportrait in Zhérama, as did some of the minor characters in this canvas, and thanks to the artist's creation, it was elevated to Kartialu. At the same time, Surikov is now creating a dazzling version of this painting in the Heavenly Kremlin. Repin's depiction of the murder of Ivan the Terrible's son tied a knot that Repin has not yet untied; he has to untie it in Drukkarg, a stronghold of anti-humanism in Russia that stands in opposition to the Heavenly Kremlin, where Ivan the Terrible is currently a prisoner and a slave.

The situation with Vrubel's "Demon Downcast" is even worse; it is a striking, unique case of a demonic infraportrait. To untie this knot, Vrubel had to descend into Gashsharvu, to the angels of darkness. It is frightening to say, but perhaps it would have been better, despite the genius of this work, if it had perished in Enrof. Landscape painting, despite its enormous cultural and psychological significance, rarely acquires a transphysical value. This happens either in those cases when the artist manages to infect the viewer with his sensation of the worlds of elementals, shining through the nature of Enrof, or to hint at peculiar combinations of lines and colors, suggesting landscapes of some other layer. In my personal opinion, this was achieved most successfully by Rerikh among Russian artists, and sometimes by such a controversial, better to say negated, even helpless artist as Churlenis.

As for artistic literature, there are no meta-images behind the characters of the overwhelming majority of its works. They are devoid of them, for example, with the exception of negligible units, in almost all Soviet literature. There can also be no meta-images for characters in historical genres, for example, Pushkin's Boris or Shakespeare's Caesar. But Macbeth has one, because it is not history. In general, the presence of a meta-image in a work entails a sharp deviation from historical literalness towards endowing the character with a special depth and scale that does not correspond to the historical prototype. This is not the case in Pushkin's drama or Shakespeare's "Caesar"; evidence of the absence of meta-historical depth in these things.

After the death of the artist-creator in Zatomis, the meta-images of his creations are seen by people in Jeram, they meet with him and communicate, because the karma of artistic creativity leads him to them. Many, many geniuses of art have to help the prototypes of their heroes in their ascent after their death. Dostoevsky spent a huge amount of time and effort raising his meta-images, since the suicide of Stavrogin and Svidrigailov, creatively and metamagically dictated by him, threw the proto-Stavrogin and proto-Svidrigailov into Urm. By now, all of Dostoevsky's heroes have been raised by him: Svidrigailov - in Kartialu. Ivan Karamazov and Smerdyakov reached Magirn - one of the worlds of High Duty. There are also Sobakevich, Chichikov, and other heroes of Gogol. Pierre Bezukhov, Andrei Bolkonsky, Princess Mary, and the hardly raised Natasha Rostova from Urm by Tolstoy. Margarita from Gete is already in one of the highest layers of Shadanakar, and Don Quixote has long been in the Synclite of the World, where Faust will soon enter.

I would like to take this opportunity to say a few words about the transcendent significance of theatrical art. The negative attitude towards this art form by Christian religiosity, no matter how it is explained by cultural historians and even religious preachers, was caused by the fact that ancient and medieval Christians, with their, so to speak, religious intuition, unconsciously felt the proximity of theatrical art to an ancient organism that is partly associated with Lilith and partly with an even darker demonic world. A few pages below, this world, called Duggur, will be further characterized by me. Duggur is associated with the sexual sphere of humanity, and although it was not clearly distinguished in the Middle Ages, people felt fear, disgust, and shame before its demonic emanations. The theatrical performance, on the other hand, can be very different, even polar in its transcendent significance. Shalyapin was deeply right in fasting and praying after playing the role of Mephistopheles. The play "The Life of Man" was harmful to both the author, the performers, and the audience because it lacked what the ancients called catharsis. Nevertheless, stage actions that lead the actor and the audience through catharsis - spiritual uplift and at least temporary enlightenment - are deeply justified. As for metaproimages, the significance of Enroth's performances for them is as follows: while Smerdyakov was in Urma, dropped there by the magical-creative influence of Dostoevsky, playing his role on the human stage was burdensome, inhibiting, and painful for him - now it is indifferent. Playing bright roles or roles that lead through catharsis is always good for everyone, including metaproimages.

On the sakual of daimons, my account leaves for a time the four-dimensional worlds: now before us is a lonely, not belonging to any sakual, already five-dimensionally spatial layer, Fongaranda.

It is necessary to give a warning: we are dealing with concepts that are quite unfamiliar. Fongaranda is the layer of the residence of the shelters of great creations of architecture. Here they have the ability to move and grow; their change consists in improvement. Their appearance is similar to that of enlightened stichials, but their form is not filamentous like theirs, and is devoid of the ability of physical interpenetration. It should be understood that the creation of their reflections in Enrof by genius architects, whose intuition caught glimpses of Fongaranda, gives them an ethereal body: inside the physical vessel of the building, it arises from the multi-year radiations of human thousands and millions. If enough time has passed and such a body has been created, the destruction of the physical vessel in Enrof no longer has transphysical significance: the shelter that was in Fongaranda is clothed in an ethereal body and passes into one of the zatomises. After the change of eons, world periods, when the zatomises cease to exist as such, the shelters of these monads with their clothing, already completely altered, will merge in one of the layers of High Duty with their monads and will subsequently enter the Elite of Shadanakar.

Fongaranda is mainly inhabited by the shelters of temple and palace-type creations. For example, there is one grandiose prototype of Orthodox monasteries, one prototype of Egyptian pyramids, ziggurats, gopurams of Southern India, Catholic abbeys, and Rhine castles. But there are also shelters of some individual buildings, such as St. Peter's Cathedral, Basil's Cathedral, the Chinese Temple of Heaven, even the Versailles and Tsarskoye Selo Palaces. There are also shelters such as the London Parliament and the St. Petersburg Admiralty.

After such strange ideas for us, like the world of Phongaranda, the ideas associated with sakual angels will probably seem familiar and even usual. There are two such sakuals. The first, lower one, consists of three layers: it is called the angels of the lower circle. Essentially, this is the first humanity of Shadanakar, which once inhabited layers of denser materiality, although not in Enroth; that era preceded the era of the Titans. We are not able to understand and comprehend the contents of their lives now, in enlightened worlds, we can only grasp that side of their activity that has a direct relation to us. The first of these layers is inhabited by cherubim, the protectors of people - carriers of bright missions. They are protectors, not inspirers - those are the demons! We have heard about guardian angels since childhood, and it's not our fault if we thought that such an angel stands behind the right shoulder of each of us. But their appearance is really as described by tradition, and the landscape of their world is an environment of charming tones that we cannot perceive, remotely reminiscent of pink and lilac.

The other layer - a white-golden environment, permeated with beams of light, belongs to seraphim - the guardians of some human associations: churches, religious communities, some ethical associations, very few cities - those whose spiritual integrity and moral purity have special meaning in the eyes of the Providence principles. There are epochs when the guard of seraphim surrounds some city because a meta-historical event or a certain trans-physical process requiring special assistance or protection takes place in it. After its completion, with the change of epochs, the guard of seraphim departs. This was the case over Kiev under Prince Vladimir the Holy, over Moscow under Princes Daniel and Ivan Kalita, several times over Jerusalem, Rome, and many other cities. A rare case when the guard of seraphim does not leave the city for many centuries is represented by Benares, a city of colossal meta-historical significance. Of course, from a narrow-confessional Christian point of view, reports like this can only cause bewilderment. Seraphim have the appearance of six-winged angels.

Sakuala is completed by the world of so-called Thrones, whose appearance is similar to our conception of archangels, and the environment of their habitation is blue-green, permeated with playing beams of light. Thrones are the guardians of nations. There are many of them: the spiritual formation of each nation requires its own guardian.

Moving on to the second sakual - the Angels of the Higher Circle - I lose the opportunity to make it easier to understand by such poor visual images as in the previous one. I can only say that these are the abodes of the bright hierarchies of immense power, namely those who create the materiality of the three-, four-, and five-dimensional layers of Shadanakar.

First come the astrals known in Christian mysticism as the Powers: they are the creators of the materiality of Enrof. Next are the Dominions, the creators of the materiality of the worlds of Enlightenment (except for Olirna) of the Sakual of the daimons. The Sakual of the Angels of the Higher Circle is crowned by the world of Beginnings, the creators of the materiality of the zatomis, and the Archangels - those who become after the transformation of Sirius, Alkonost, and Gamaun of Heaven, Eden, Montsalvat, Zhunfleya, and the Holy Rose - all the zatomis of the Christian metaculture. They create the materiality of the worlds of High Duty. The materiality of the angelic worlds themselves, as well as the materiality of the higher layers of Shadanakar, are created by the hierarchies of metabramphature.

I know that the presented perfection does not coincide with the traditions of Christian angelology, despite the similarity of names. I am sorry that this is the case. But I am not writing on my own behalf and cannot make changes until the only Voice I fully trust indicates it. The exposition has reached the sakuala of High Duty. These worlds are common to humans, angels, demons, elementals, and even enlightened animals. They float high above those segmentary divisions of Shadanakar called metacultures. Clearly, my information about them is poor, if not impoverished.

I am not even sure of the name of the first one—it sounds similar to Usnorm, but I cannot hear it more precisely. The rotation of the planet around its axis manifests here, and apparently, there was night there, because I vaguely remember the brilliantly beautiful glowing nebula, as if the creative womb of our universe had opened up before my eyes for the first time. That was Astrafire, the great center of our galaxy, hidden from us by the dark clouds of cosmic matter in Enrof.

I saw the scatter of countless stars, but not like ours: they were not stars, but bramfaturas. Not shining dots, but systems of translucent concentric spheres overlapping each other; when my gaze stopped on any of them, it became huge and distinct, as if it had come closer; now it seems to me that they were all slowly rotating, harmoniously sounding and echoing with multi-voiced voices. But perhaps that is only my perception now, and it is influenced by the ideas and harmony of spheres that came to me not from within, but from human tradition. In any case, these harmonies only emerged through the waves of an unimaginable choir sounding here, around me, and rising from such depths and heights that I could neither understand nor measure with my gaze.

This is a memory of a layer that represents the all-encompassing temple intended for the eternal worship of humanity.

Oh, not just humanity! It seems that millions of beings were present here, and I don't know how many of them were never human and were never meant to become human. Enlightened souls of stihia and enlightened souls of animals were here, as well as wondrous daemons and angels of different orders. When we read in the Apocalypse the prophecy of the highly intelligent animals surrounding the altar of another world and performing service, this may be a symbol, but it is also a hint at reality - the reality that did not yet exist in the time of the author of the Apocalypse. Because Usnorn, as a universal temple, is the realization of the idea of that great human spirit who, in his last incarnation on earth, was the apostle John the Theologian. And if there were millions of worshippers there, then the attendants before the throne of the Temple were numbered in the thousands, because everyone who reaches the sakwala of High Duty becomes one of the attendants in Usnorn, and is then replaced by the next one.

The most elevated and well-organized services in the temples of the supreme religions are just weak reflections, echoes of the eternal liturgy of Usnorma. Yes, words participate in this liturgy, but it is an unrepeatable language for us - the Synclicite language of the World, where words are not just individual sounds, but as if meaningful chords, and some of them are also flashes and interflows of light. In this liturgy, movement participates as an element, the heavenly prototype of sacred dance, but in Usnorma, there are five dimensions, and movement is performed not on a horizontal plane, as in our world, but in all five dimensions of space. Light and color participate as elements in the liturgy, but there is no possibility of giving an idea of colors beyond the seven colors that we perceive. What can be said about those light symphonies before which the illumination of Fire seems monotonous and poor? What can be said about spiritual fragrances? About the fimiama of Usnorma, which rise from giant censers that sway and float to ascend to the very Astrafayr? This is the first world where the ascending one perceives not only material but purely spiritual emanations: they originate from the highest transcosmic spheres, which could be called the Empyreum if this ancient word is understood not as a fantastic "world of immovable stars," but as a cosmic dwelling of pure Spirit, that is, the Holy Trinity.

The Worlds of High Obligation are stops between the Zatomises, the Cardial of the daemons, and the Hangvill of the enlightened animals, on the one hand, and the Worlds of Higher Transmiffs of the Supreme Religions on the other. Above Usnorma is Gridruttva - that white palace where the great creative plan of humanity is created. Behind it are Alikanda, similar to the heart of a flower, Tovia, similar to foam, frost, a white garden, falling snow, and Ro - huge singing crystals: their echo is the most beautiful works of music in Enrofa, in Olirna, among the daemons, even in the Zatomises. These three layers are the abodes of human monads reunited with their becoming souls.

Similar to the depth of illuminated seas, the layer of Magirn is the abode of monads, metaproimages, reunited with their shells and with transfigured astral garments. In Kaermis, which can be described as "unlocked sphinxes," the monads of animals unite with their newly-acquired souls, in Deitrist - the monads of daimons, and in Sibran, about which I cannot say anything except that it is an incredible choir of exultation - the monads of angels. In Flauros, which the word "protuberances" can hint at, reside the monads of elementals. The world of High Responsibility, Sakual, also includes Niatos: it is a violet peak where the monads of our former enemies - the demons who turned to the Light - are reunited with their shells. I mentioned the mighty demonic spirit, the great "dragon" of the Primordial Mongolian culture, which was cast by Gagtung into one of the terrible layers, bearing the nickname "Rain of Eternal Melancholy". It has long been raised by Providential principles from there and now shines in the world of the violet peak as one of its most beautiful stars. And as far as I understand, only partly does the colossal and magnificent Iroln belong to this Sakual: the monads of people before their union with their newly-acquired souls. This is the first world that the personal spirit of every person descends to, entering Shadanakar from the Father's bosom. It is like the flow and rotation of many suns. And it is not clear to me: it seems to me that this world is not five, but six dimensions of space, and its inclusion in the Sakual of Higher Responsibility is my mistake, a product of aberration.

Higher up on the hierarchical ladder of Shadanakar are, one after another, the sakuals of cosmic involutions. What does this mean? In the continuing history of Shadanakar, which spans millions of years, active influences from other brafmaturs have occurred and continue to occur: either more powerful than ours, or ahead of us in their development, or finally, comparable to ours in their scale and stages of ascent, but located spatially not so far from us, thus interacting with Shadanakar. The materiality of the worlds of the involutions is created by the bright forces of other brafmaturs; they are inhabited by the highest beings who effortlessly traverse cosmic spaces - these are aliens from other brafmaturs, great helpers and friends of the bright forces of Shadanakar. I cannot say literally anything about some sakuals of the involutions, except for a few names. For example, there is the sakual of the Orion involutions. Orion is a system of brafmaturs of giant power, completely liberated from demonic principles; it plays a colossal role in the life of the Galaxy. Of course, the list of names of the ten layers that make up this sakual cannot cause anything but disappointment with its meager contents. But I don't know - maybe even these names will be useful someday. - Yumaroya. Odgiana. Ramn. Vualra. Ligeia. Fianna. Eramo. Veatnor. Zaolita. Natolis.

Despite the vast differences in the conditions that exist in the physical layers of Jupiter or Neptune compared to our own, we must come to terms with the fact that many planets and their satellites possess bramfaturas. Even in our own layer of Enroth, Jupiter is inhabited by highly intelligent beings that are so different from us and live in such unimaginable conditions that there is never any communication between us. However, communication does exist in the five-dimensional layers of both bramfaturas. The elite of Jupiter and its satellites have created two layers of their involution within Shadanakar, one layer created by Saturn and its satellites, one by Uranus, and one by Neptune. All of these layers make up the sakual of planetary involution.

Three layers hold a special place - Iora, Ahnos, and Gebn. These are the sakuals of involution of the transformed planet Daiya, which no longer exists in Enroth. This planet once rotated between Mars and Jupiter. Demiurgic activity on it led, a long time ago, to the expulsion of demonic forces to its satellite's opposing bramfatura. Daiya entered its third zone, meaning it was physically transformed and disappeared from the world of Enroth. The satellite, however, underwent catastrophic fragmentation (asteroids - its debris) and demonic hordes dispersed into space. When our scientific instruments become strong enough to observe planets from other star systems, we will sometimes witness the sudden disappearance of some of these planets over the course of a few hours. Scientists will likely develop a number of clever hypotheses to explain this phenomenon before they recognize that the same thing that happened to the planet Daiya is occurring in these cases.

Sakuala of solar involutions consists of nine layers. Again, only names... Raos. Flermos. Tramnos. Gimnos. Areya. Nigveya. Trimoya. Derain. Iordis.

And four names for the layers of the Galactic Center's involutions - Astraphire: Grezuar, Malein, Viruana, Luvarn.
The system that is more accurately called Bramfatura only partially belongs to the Sakual involutions, although it is now part of Shadanakar, encompassing its five-dimensional and six-dimensional layers. This is the Lunar Bramfatura.
I don't know exactly when the development of lunar humanity - the Selenites - ended in Enrof; in any case, it happened a very long time ago, almost a million years ago. But development there proceeded much more slowly, although it took significantly less time from the appearance of organic life on the surface of the Moon to the emergence of highly intelligent beings there than for a similar process to occur on our planet. In general, the idea that worlds of smaller physical scale must necessarily evolve faster is not always applicable to specific periods of the development of organic life on them, let alone the pace of development of intelligent beings. But Wells' intuition about the appearance of these beings, described in his fascinating novel, is remarkable, especially considering the rationalistic coloring and scientific plane of his thinking. He guessed the general insectoid appearance of these beings, and the soft-elastic nature of their physical tissues, and the ability of their bodies to change shape depending on their activities, and the height of their technological achievements, and even that the interior of the planet was partly utilized by the end.

The tragedy of the Selenites consisted in the victory of Vogel, the lunar demon of feminine nature. It may seem puzzling how the activity of the feminine-demonic element manifested itself in this rational civilization. However, there is a particular type of rationality, namely, feminine rationality, which is not expressed as weakly as in our humanity. Among the Selenites, it manifested itself with special force and affected, in particular, the fact that their technology was much more magical in its principles than human technology.

The stages of the Selenites' spiritual and cultural decline were as follows: devil-humanity - degeneration - destruction under the weight of technology. The progressing spirituality led to the fact that the wild Selenites could not cope with their own machines and perished from cold and hunger. However, Vogel's world is still included in the Lunar Brahmatry. He has been in a peculiar semi-isolation for an extremely long time, hostile both to the forces of Light and partly to Gaghtungar. But recently, a compromise and even an alliance between him and the planetary demon Shadanakar has been emerging - a consolidation of forces for the expulsion of the forces of Light from Shadanakar. One demonic layer of Shadanakar, called Duggur - we will talk about it later - is closely linked to Vogel's emanations. Now, this blue-gray, seductive and engulfing demoness is restoring a special layer - the lunar hell, where, with Gaghtungar's consent, the victims of Duggur will be cast down; until now, some of these victims have suffered an even more terrible fate - being thrown out of Shadanakar into the voids of the Galaxy.

Three other layers of the Lunar Sakuala oppose Vogel's world. Soldbis is visible from the Zatomis on the face of the Moon: it is the world of the habitation of many enlightened beings - those who tragically lagged behind in their time; their last incarnation in Enrof fell in the era of lunar devil-humanity and degeneration; the entire huge subsequent period was spent on correction and gradual enlightenment in Soldbis. Another world is Laal, the lunar elite. Many Selenites have risen even higher to the Elite of Shadanakar. And finally, the third, brightest of the lunar worlds - Tanit, the abode of the lunar goddess.

If we break down by a subtle analysis into its component strands what we feel on moonlit nights, we will discover the following components of our experience. First: a premonition of harmony; it is evoked by Soldbis and Laal. Second: the subtlest longing for the upper world; it calls us to Tanit. And third: a yearning for sexual abysses; it torments us and tempts us with Voglea. She fears the Sun and always retreats from its radiance to the unilluminated side of the Moon. During full moon, we receive only weakened emanations of Voglea - those that penetrate through the thickness of the earth's satellite. But when the Moon is in decline, Voglea moves together with darkness to its side facing the Earth; that is why lunar decline and new moon nights act so painfully, darkly, and heavily on the subconscious sphere of many of us.

The exposition of the structure of Shadankar has finally reached that grandiose sakuala which I have to designate with painfully cumbersome definitions such as the worlds of what could be called the Higher Aspects of Supreme Religions, their purest transmiffs.

Many years ago, long before the Civil War, when I was still very young, an incomprehensible, beautiful, and relentlessly insistent image appeared to me: a bluish crystal pyramid as if seen from an infinite distance, through which the sun was shining. I felt the enormity of its significance, the waves of grace, power, and beauty pouring out of this glowing center, but I could not understand the meaning of this image. Later, I even thought that it was a reflection of the World's Savior refracted by my limited human consciousness. A child's thought! One whose soul is touched by the reflection of the World's Savior becomes a righteous person and a prophet. And certainly, its reflection has nothing in common with anything earthly.

Only many years later, and quite recently, it became clear to me that this pyramid is not alone, that there are others as if coordinated with it, and there are five of them in total, and the sixth one will never be in Shadankar. But the blue one is truly unique; the others are of different colors, and it is impossible to say which one is more beautiful. Oh, certainly, transmiffs "in themselves" are transcendent for us; perhaps "in themselves" they have no resemblance to any geometric forms. But they touched my consciousness exactly as gigantic crystal pyramids, and apparently, the existence of such images has a deep meaning.

Later, something else struck me: that one of the pyramids, smaller in size but of an astonishing otherworldly whiteness, is the highest transmif of a religion that I personally would never have classified as global or supreme: the transmif of Zoroastrianism. This confusion has still not been dispelled. I still cannot understand how this local religion, which has long since faded in Enrof and, as it seems to me, is not so rich in mythology, turns out to be a reflection of such a colossal reality that is only professed by it. This world is called Azure.

Another pyramid, also of relatively small proportions but golden, is clearer to me. This is the highest aspect of Judaism, the aspect that leaves far behind the anti-Christian irreconcilability of its earthly counterpart, dull and murky. This is the golden world of heavenly glory that shone through the visions of the great mystics of Kabbalah, in the insights of the prophets, and for which the painstaking yarn of the Talmud is like dust in the valleys for the lords of mountain heights. The name of the golden pyramid is Aeh.

The gigantic pyramid, the color of which resembles our lilac, is the highest aspect of the Hindu transmif. This complex world is layered, and its outer layer is the ultimate goal of Vedanta and Yoga, and its highest layer is the Synclite of India, a hint of which we would find in Indian philosophy under the name of Niruddhi. About another layer, Eroia, and one more, whose name I do not have the right to pronounce, I can only say that although those who were once human also live in these worlds, they are more like guests here. The last of the layers of the lilac pyramid is Shatrittva, the abode of many hierarchies of the Hindu pantheon. But to speak of an exact correspondence of the images of this pantheon to the hierarchies of the transmif can only be partly true in individual cases. For example, under the same name Kali-Durgi, completely different instances of the cosmic hierarchy are worshiped in Enrof, from the "All-People's Aphrodite" of India to the Prisnodeva-Mother of the Universe.

No less great is the green pyramid consisting of two tiers, which is the world of the highest aspect of Buddhism. There is a misconception that Buddhism, at least the southern branch, is atheistic. In reality, on the highest levels of Hinayana, as well as Jainism, there is certainly no atheism. However, starting with Gautama and Mahavira, thinkers and preachers believed that it was better for the masses to emphasize the insignificance of the question of God in spiritual salvation, so that the effort would not be transferred to God, which man himself is obliged to make. And how else could those whose Nirvana is the first of the two tiers of the great green pyramid think of God? The second tier belongs to the dhyani-bodhisattvas, the hierarchies that lead the people of the Buddhist meta-culture. The claims of Tibetan spiritual leaders that most Dalai Lamas are reincarnations of the dhyani-bodhisattva Avalokiteshvara should be taken with the utmost seriousness. A literal understanding of this statement would show that the clarity of our consciousness has not yet exceeded the clarity that is achievable within certain denominational frameworks. However, if we understood that the thesis of the reincarnation of Avalokiteshvara in the Dalai Lama's succession line is a form of hint that is tailored to the level of popular understanding, indicating the fact of the inspiration of most Dalai Lamas by this great hierarchy, then we would be close to the truth. The penultimate of the Tibetan Dalai Lamas was not fully inspired, and the current ruler is nothing but a substitution, hence his behavior.

The blue pyramid that has been enticing me for twenty years is the Heavenly Jerusalem, the highest transmyth of Christianity. This is what stands behind the statements of Christian doctrine that are common to Catholics, Orthodox Christians, Lutherans, Abyssinians, and future followers of the Rose of the World. "Statements," I said, but that's not accurate, because what is common to all, what is almost impossible to express in verbal formulas, is the Heavenly Jerusalem, the highest layer of synclites of Christian metacultures, and yet it is not yet the Church. The Church is the highest worlds of Shadanakar. And before we can approach them, we must go back, deep down into the fire and darkness, for without understanding the frightening and formidable demonic sakwal, we cannot approach the higher layers of Shadanakar with our thoughts.

## Book IV. Structure of Shadanakar. Infra-physics

### Chapter 1. Foundation

One of the facts that religious consciousness has not yet fully realized is that the Trinity of the One Being, inherent in God, is somehow repeated or reproduced in some of the monads He created. The crude expression "The Devil is God's monkey" has a deep and multifaceted meaning; one of its most important meanings is the distorting, inverted repetition of the inner mystery of Divinity: its Trinity, by great demonic monads. Of the essence of the triunity of Lucifer, I can of course say nothing: these instances so immensely exceed all the possibilities of our understanding that it is hardly possible to realize anything about them, except for the fact of their existence, the fact of their fall in time immemorial, and one more fact: their constant anti-divine activity.

The essence of Gagtungar, the great demon of Shadanakar, despite its gigantic, relative to us, scales, can be somewhat better realized under favorable conditions. The main thing that becomes clear is his trinity, although the reasons for this trinity, its origin and purpose - if it has one - remain undisclosed.

First of all, it is clear that there is some kind of sacrilegious parallelism of the hypostases of the Holy Trinity here. But the question of the essence of the Divine Trinity, perhaps the deepest of the problems of theology, can be at least touched upon only in another part of the book; therefore, the essence of the parallelism that I mentioned cannot be illuminated in this chapter. It can only be said that Gagtungur strives to oppose his First Hypostasis of the Divine Trinity to his first person, the Great Tormentor; the Second Hypostasis, which can best be characterized as the Great Harlot, opposes him; and the antipode named Urparp opposes the Third Hypostasis of the Trinity: this is the executor of the demonic plan; in a sense, it can be called the principle of form, it is that side of the great demonic creature that opens up in the life of various layers of Shadanakar as a beginning that actively transforms their givenness according to the intentions and goals of the Tormentor, the beginning that forms. The Great Harlot, whose name is Fokkarma, is the side of the demonic creature that sucks in and absorbs souls and destinies into Gagtungur's orbit. The first person, Histurg, the Great Tormentor, is the ultimate depth of the demonic self, the bearer of the highest will, power, and desire.

His appearance, as seen by the spiritual eyes of a few people who have penetrated into the dark heights of Digma, the world of his habitat, is immensely frightening. As if reclining on a raging purple ocean, with black wings stretching from horizon to horizon, he lifts his dark gray face to the zenith, where infra-lilac flares blaze, protuberances sway and go out, and at the very zenith shines a luminary of an unimaginable color, remotely reminiscent of violet. Woe to him on whom Gagtungur lowers his gaze and who meets that gaze with open eyes. Of all the bearers of dark missions among the people who later admired in Digma, only one (Torkvemada) seems to have found the strength to remember God's name at this moment. The rest of the monads became slaves of the devil for countless ages.

In addition to Gagtungar, there are also chosen ones of evil in Digme: the monads of a few people who have merged with their demonized shells, and the equally few souls of some demonic creatures, including the great igvs, the dark leaders of anti-humanity, who have already completed their path in various denser material layers. Here they create a plan to fight the gods, here they extend themselves before Gisturg, enjoy the closeness of the Great Whore, and delve into the depths of knowledge through the contemplation of Urparp.

There is a higher demonic layer in Shadanakar: the multidimensional Shog, the materiality of which is created by the great demons macrobromfatur. Powerful streams of inspiring, enveloping anti-godly forces flow here from the depths of the universe, and no one but Gagtungar can enter this layer. Others, and only in the rarest moments, can see it only from the outside. In these moments, they perceive the luminary of indescribable color, which burns in the zenith of Digme, no longer as a sphere, but as a pulsating arc, spanning from edge to edge and again resembling purple in color. This is the anti-cosmos of the galaxy, the center of the forces of Lucifer himself. At times, the arc seems to bend inward, and the forces of Lucifer flow into Shog. Then Gagtungar, receiving them into himself, raises his wings into the black sky. At least that is how those who see Shog from the outside perceive it. The phenomena and forms of this world are transcendent in themselves.

However, there are other layers in Shadanakar from where the anti-cosmos of the Galaxy can be observed, albeit in a different aspect. The anti-cosmos of all the brahmfatur, including Shadanakar, is two-dimensional, like infinite planes. They all intersect with each other in the same line, which can be called the demonic axis of the Galaxy. To facilitate understanding, let's use a hypothetical spatial model. Take a book, stand it vertically on its spine, open it and extend the two-dimensional plane of each page to infinity in thought. All these planes will intersect with each other at different angles, but all of them will intersect in the same vertical line inside the spine. The cosmic analogue of this intersection line of all planes is the demonic axis of the Galaxy, its anti-cosmos. Naturally, it will be visible to any creature living in any of these two-dimensional plane worlds, including the corresponding layer of Shadanakar.

The two-dimensional layer of Shadanakar is sometimes called the hell, but this term is not entirely appropriate here. This layer is not a place of torment for human souls after death, but rather the dwelling place for most of the demonic creatures on our planet. It can be called the anti-cosmos of Shadanakar, but even this is not entirely accurate because the Divine Cosmos is opposed not only by this layer but by all the demonic worlds, and it is just the main demonic citadel, so to speak. Its real name is Gashsharva.

The beings that reside there can be considered as being in a state of embodiment, if desired, although the concept of embodiment is very relative in general. The monads of these beings are always high in Digme and Shoge, while their shells drag their existence between embodiments, mostly in the one-dimensional Pit of Shadanakar - a terrifying world.

Gasharva is the core of a system created by the demonic forces of Shadanakar in opposition to the Divine Cosmos, intended to replace it. This solemn but grim world could not fail to appear terrifying to anyone of us. The large number of temporal coordinates, with only two spatial ones, creates a peculiar spiritual density. For any monad, the process of entering its shell into this world is excruciating; it is reminiscent of the sensation that arises when the body is tightly laced into a narrow iron corset. The fewer spatial coordinates there are, the denser the materiality of the world. However, the environment of this world is still similar to air, and the ground, which is completely flat and uniform, is harder than any material in Enroth. There is no equivalent to vegetation. The source of light consists of the self-illumination of beings and some artificial structures, with no perception of blue and green colors here, but two infrared colors are perceived. I will tentatively call one of them infraviolet, emphasizing that it has nothing to do with ultraviolet, and the impression it produces is closest to that which a very dense, dark, and intense purple color makes on us.

The Anti-cosmos of the Galaxy, visible from Digma as a luminary of unimaginable and indescribable color, and from Shoga - as a titanic, blazing, and pulsating infralilac arc, thrown across the zenith, from Gashsharva it appears as a horizon section, sending uniform infralilac radiation from infinitely remote spaces. All the inhabitants of Gashsharva are bound together by the tyranny of Gagtungra and, at the same time, something like an alliance of common interests. They hate Gagtungra, but of course not as much as God. Here live the owners of the lower purgatories, magma and the core - the three Sakuals of Retribution.

Vrubel's "Demon Defeated" is ambiguous, dual-layered: it is both a memory of enlightenment in Digma, of Gagtungra spreading its wings to the horizon; and it is a meta-portrait, more accurately, an infra-portrait, of one of the demons, relatively small compared to him: the owners of the purgatories. They are called angels of darkness, and this name perfectly corresponds to their appearance: they have some human resemblance, they have wide wings of amazing beauty, and there is something royal in the purple and scarlet color of these wings. But on Vrubel's canvas, these wonderful wings are broken: the genius intuition of the artist conveyed the fatal impairment of the inhabitants of Gashsharva. In reality, their wings are not damaged, but the very possibility of using them is painfully limited since in the dense, albeit transparent environment of this layer, only slow penetration through materiality is possible, not flight. The gray, ashen color of the faces of the angels of darkness is repulsive and terrifying, and their features are completely exposed to their predatory and merciless nature. Being the owners of the lower purgatories, they replenish the loss of their life force by absorbing the gavvahs of people involved in purgatories with their karma. Penetrating from Gashsharva into these purgatories, they find a less dense environment there, in which angular flight is still possible, albeit with jerks and zigzags.

Other inhabitants of Gashsharva, the owners of magma, are completely devoid of human resemblance: they are called rhyphrams. Most of all, each of them is similar to a moving range of hills. There is something like a face, but very blurry.

Perhaps the reader of this book will reproach me for a lack of imagination or for my adherence to the Christian tradition, precisely in its most unconvincing details. But it is precisely the play of imagination that I am striving to banish from these pages, and the poorer they are in fantasy, the better. And from the Christian tradition, here remains not what I personally would have preferred, but what has been confirmed in my spiritual experience. Unfortunately, confirmation has also been received for the images of some beings proclaimed by Christian demonology. Strangely enough, creatures resembling the infamous demons really exist, with tails and horns, no less. They dwell in Gashsharva and take dubious pleasure in being the masters of the Jadra-Sakuala, composed of the most terrifying torments of Shadanakar. In general, it turns out that many of the legends to which we are accustomed to smile or, in the best case, see a symbolic meaning, should be understood quite literally. The test for the sanity of our age is truly insurmountable! The circle of inhabitants of Gashsharva is whimsical and colorful. Among them, I also know of powerful demons of a feminine nature, who are conventionally called Velga. These are giants. In the history of mankind, they sometimes manifest themselves as multipliers of victims and inspirers of anarchy. Whatever their likeness may be, not only to humans, but even to the monsters of our world, it must be completely forgotten here: these are rather huge, coiling and unfolding covers, black and purple. Each Velga seems to have only one nation; in any case, in Russia, there is only one, very ancient one. The terms of their incarnations in Gashsharva - if they can be counted as incarnations - are apparently measured in many centuries.

Once, all these creatures lived on the surface of the earth, but not in Enroth, but in a layer of approximately the same density and even remotely similar to it. Created by Gaggunghr at the very beginning of the history of Shadanakar, this layer has long ceased to exist. The external forms of demonic creatures were smaller and generally somewhat different in that world. But they could not feel like masters there: they were compressed, constrained by light. Under its influence, their nature had to change; it ceased to correspond to their demonic essence. Now life is not easy for them in Gashsharve, but there they still remain themselves. There are also other creatures nesting there, but I do not know them. However, it is known that some of those who were humans in Enroth are there: carriers of special dark missions. However, they hardly suffer here. The task is different: in Gashsharve, with the help of Gaggunghr's forces, they are carefully prepared for the next incarnation in humanity. What motivations can drive such a mission to be accepted by a human shield? - Dante accepted it out of fear. After death, cast through all the layers to the Pit of Shadanakar, he was taken from there to Gashsharve by the forces of Urparpa and some time later was born again in Enroth. I do not know if he has already died again, but quite recently he existed in Russia, where, performing a new dark mission, he destroyed several large gifts. Sometimes a dark mission is also accepted voluntarily, out of a thirst for power, a thirst for blood, or an innate attraction to evil. This was the case, for example, with Timur, who went through the same circles as Dante after death, but much more slowly. Finally raised to Gashsharve, he accepted a new mission out of hopelessness. This mission was incomparably smaller than the first: Gaggunghr likes to mock everyone, including his puppets.

The Forces of Light often have to descend into Gashsharva. These descents are painful, but they are necessary: the circumstances of the struggle against the hordes of Gagtungar require it. The inhabitants of Gashsharva see their penetrating enemies, but they are powerless to prevent their penetration.

The Demonic Base includes one more world: the world of one-dimensional space and one-dimensional time. This is the Pit of Shadanakar, the torture chamber of demonic shelters and a few people - carriers of dark missions. The Pit was created at the very beginning of the existence of our Brahmfatura by the efforts of Gagtungar and even more powerful dark forces than he. This materiality is the densest of all possible. Enropha's materiality is only somewhat similar to it in the interiors of stars or in such monstrous bodies of our Galaxy as "white dwarfs". It is difficult to imagine how movement can still take place under such conditions. However, it exists on the Pit of Shadanakar, and it is excruciatingly painful for a conscious being. It is called upon to maintain life forces, as otherwise the creature will be drawn into a certain abyss leading to even sadder places: to the Pit of the Galaxy.

All this helps to finally understand the relativity of the concept of "incarnation." Demons, incarnated in Gashsharva or in some other layers of three or even four dimensions, after death are immersed in the Pit, where they await a new body, the densest of all possible. Such is the law of karma, which turns against the demons themselves with its second edge. By emanations of their suffering on the Pit, Gagtungar himself replenishes the loss of his life forces. To rebel against the law of karma? But during their incarnations in all other layers, this law is precisely the source of their life forces. To rebel against it means to reject gavvah as food, to oppose oneself to the entire demonic rank, to the entire anticosmos - that is, to stop being demons.

Every bramfatura in our Galaxy has such a Pit, except for those that are free from demonic forces; therefore, there are millions of such "bottoms" in the Galaxy. Just as two-dimensional space planes of many anti-cosmos or gashsharv intersect in a common line, all the cosmic lines of galactic bottoms intersect at a single point of convergence. This point is located in the star system of Antares. This star, also known as the Heart of Scorpio, was not coincidentally an embodiment of ominous, even demonic forces in many ancient and medieval mythologies. The enormous planetary system of this star is the center of the god-killing armies of the Galaxy, their habitat in the three-dimensional world. It is also a titanic metaphysical realm of demons, the anti-cosmos of our Milky Way to the extent that this anti-cosmos is manifested in Enroth. As I have already said, the bramfaturas in which the demons have won are short-lived, and the great planet that is now enveloping the Pit of Shadanakar will soon disintegrate, but it will be replaced by another. The one that enveloped the creation of Shadanakar perished millions of years ago. In our latitudes, Antares is visible in late spring and summer low above the southern horizon, and many remember the bright pulsation of its wine-red rays. However, from the Pit of Shadanakar, neither the Sun nor other celestial bodies are visible—nothing but the motionless Antares, which is anchored to the Pit at one end. From there, it appears infrared. In the opposite direction, the space of this one-dimensional world fades away as it approaches the surface of the Earth's sphere. Nothing is visible in that direction. That is where the abyss of the Pit of the Galaxy devoid of time lies.

It is difficult to imagine how the body, the densest of all, could be something like the simplest thing we can imagine: something like a black line. It is even harder to understand that these beings maintain an equivalent of vision and even touch. The most incomprehensible thing, perhaps, is how they are able to see through an extremely dense medium at all. They draw their life force from this medium. Their communication with each other is possible, but extremely limited. The suffering is indescribable.

Not only the Pit, but all the worlds of the demonic Foundation arose, as I have already said, during the cooling period of Shadanakar's physical body. Before organic life appeared in Enrof, Gahtunggra's activity tended towards attempts to create a layer of habitat for demonic forces on the surface of the earth, and when this failed, towards the strengthening and development of Gashsharva and other layers associated with the lower layers of the crust, with magma and the planet's core. However, when organic life appeared in Enrof, its activity turned towards seizing the realm of animals - this was partly successful - and towards weighing down the laws of the demiurges. As a result of the interaction of these two forces, the foundations of the laws of Nature and Karma in which we live were formed.
Religions of Semitic origin tend to blame the cruelty of the laws on the deity. As surprising as it may be, the cruelty of the laws of retribution did not cause protest, at least not consciously, and was not even noticed. Even the righteous of Christian metacultures accepted the idea of eternal suffering for sinners with incomprehensible calm. The absurdity of eternal retribution for temporary evil did not trouble their minds, and their conscience - incomprehensibly to us - was satisfied with the idea of the eternal immutability, that is, the hopelessness of these laws. But that state of mind and conscience has long passed. And it seems blasphemous to us to think that this Law, as it exists, was created by divine whim.

Yes, not a single hair falls without the will of the Heavenly Father, not a single leaf on a tree stirs. However, this should be understood not in the sense that the entire world's Law in its entirety is a manifestation of God's Will, but rather that the formation of free will, which represents the Universe, is sanctioned by God. The presence of many free wills created the possibility of some of them falling away; from their falling away, their struggle with the Forces of Light and their creation of an anti-cosmos arose, opposing the Creator's Cosmos.

From the very beginning of the emergence of living life in Enrofe Gagtungr, its laws were affected by his influence. They were unable to change the laws of the middle layers of Shadanakar, but many types and classes of the animal kingdom and some layers of elementals fell under their rule - either fully or partially. Hence the duality of what we call nature: beauty, spirituality, harmony, friendliness, on the one hand, and universal predation of living beings, on the other. Is it not obvious that both sides are equally real? Can any person with conscience and intelligence, no matter how much they may love nature, dare to say that its harmony covers and removes the boundless sea of suffering that this very nature presents to unbiased eyes? And can anyone be found who, in spite of this sea of suffering, so evident, so undeniable, and so deafening to us with the groans and cries of living beings, would not occasionally experience nature as inexplicable, in spite of all its enduring harmony and incomparable beauty? Why has this fatal contradiction not been understood and resolved to this day? Is it not because religious thought in the West for more than twenty centuries has been in the grip of the idea of God's absolute omnipotence and the resulting prejudices about the unity of Nature, while in the East, the established philosophical monism does not allow us to come closer to understanding its duality?

### Chapter 2. Realms of Retribution

During the era of primitive societies, demonic forces were occupied with hindering their development and preparing the layers of transphysical magma and core to receive the millions of souls of the upcoming humanity. Somewhat later, in historical times, the shrastras and sakual witzraorovs were created. Most of the purgatories emerged in even later epochs.

The exposition of the Realms of Retribution begins with purgatories because they are closer to us than the others; they are more commensurate with the concepts familiar to us, and in cases of the descending path after death, the descent begins precisely with the purgatories. In most cases, it is also limited to purgatories.

The word "purgatory" is taken from Catholicism, but the panorama of what will be discussed does not coincide with Catholic concepts in all respects. The term "Sheol" could also be applied to these layers, but the Jewish pictures of these shadowy lands of the dead will also not be repeated in my exposition.

Purgatories of different metacultures differ somewhat from each other; even taken separately, each of them undergoes significant changes over the centuries. They also formed in different epochs. In ancient metacultures, including Byzantium, they did not exist at all. More precisely, in their place, there were worlds of despairing suffering; an echo of mystical knowledge about the hopelessness of the torments is clearly heard in most ancient religions.

The oldest of the purgatories belong to the metaculture of India: it was this synclite that first achieved the power of Light in human history, which was necessary to prevent the forces of Gagtungra from turning some layers of the expiatory afterlife into places of suffering, which the Indian metaculture inherited from the oldest human civilizations - daemons and titans. Later, some layers of the metacultures of Judaism, Christianity, and Islam were transformed into purgatories: here, the decisive factor was the resurrection of Jesus Christ, His descent into demonic worlds, and the subsequent centuries-long struggle of Christian synclites with demons for the softening of the Law of Retribution. But in the Byzantine metaculture, this struggle was not crowned with victory. The enemy's position proved insurmountable resistance; as a result, the Byzantine metaculture was cut off from Enroth. I have already mentioned in passing the significance of the fact that Byzantine Orthodoxy did not accept the idea of purgatory when it appeared in the Western Church. The terrifying perspective of eternal torment awaiting the sinful soul should be sought in the combustible substance of the ascetic maximalism that inflamed the Byzantine religious spirit until the very end of its history. Yes, before the seers of Byzantium, the eschatological depth opened up with all the extremities of its demonic cruelty. It is necessary to be surprised not by the desperate excesses of asceticism in this country, but rather by the fact that not all metacultures devoid of purgatories had similar excesses.

In the Russian metaculture, the first Sheol was created in the 12th century, transformed from a place of suffering by the efforts of Christ. Over time, it changed its appearance somewhat, and so did the karmic burdens that draw the dead into this world. However, the mechanical aspect of the Law of Retribution remains unchanged, always and everywhere: it consists of the fact that violating moral laws leads to a burdening of the etheric body of the perpetrator. As long as he is alive, the burdened etheric body remains on the surface of the three-dimensional world, with the physical body playing the role of a lifebuoy for a drowning person. But as soon as the connection between them is broken by death, the etheric body begins to sink deeper and deeper, from layer to layer, until it reaches equilibrium with the surrounding environment. This is, in essence, the mechanism. But there are also beings who oversee its unfailing operation: karma guardians. This is a completely special category; among the various demons of Shadanakar, they are aliens. When the demonic hordes of the planet Daii were driven away from its Brahmfatura, to the Brahmfatura of its companion, and the companion soon perished and turned into a flock of dead pieces - asteroids, its demonic inhabitants scattered in the world space in search of new havens. Some of them invaded Shadanakar, concluding some sort of agreement with the forces of Gagtungar. These are highly intelligent creatures, but with a cold, icy sphere of feelings. They are equally alien to hatred and love, malice and compassion. They took on the task of the karma mechanism, replenishing the loss of their life force with emanations of the mental anguish of those people who, after living in Enroth, are forced to descend into Skrivnus, Ladref, and Morod - the upper layers of purgatory. The size of these creatures is enormous; they are semi-transparent and gray, like murky glass, their bodies are rectangular, and in their faces, strangely enough, there is a resemblance to the faces of guard dogs: erect ears and watchful eyes. They only enter into battle with the forces of Light when these forces undertake the work of mitigating the laws of karma and transforming the purgatories.

The first of the purgatories is called Skrivnus. It is a picture of a godless world and society without any embellishments. A colorless landscape; a leaden-grey sea that is never turbulent. The withered grass, low shrubs, and mosses to some extent resemble our tundra. But at least in the spring, the tundra is covered with flowers; Skrivnus' soil has not grown a single flower. The dwelling places of the millions of masses who were once human are basins enclosed by low but inaccessible slopes. Skrivnus knows neither love nor hope nor joy, religion, nor art, nor has it ever seen children. Endless toil is interrupted only for sleep, but dreams are devoid of dreams, and work is not creative. Some huge, frightening creatures are awake on the other side of the slopes, occasionally throwing heaps of objects from there, as if gliding through the air. Each of the objects finds its own worker: repairing useless rags, washing something like oily and dirty jars, repairing metal scraps. Both work and sleep primarily take place in barrack-like houses, long and internally fenced with waist-high barriers. The appearance of the inhabitants retains complete human likeness, but the features are washed out and smoothed. They resemble pancakes that are almost identical to each other. However, the memory of existence in Enroth is not only preserved in the souls of the inhabitants but also gnaws at them like a dream of a lost paradise. The most relentless agony of Skrivnus is the boredom of hopeless slavery, the tediousness of labor, and the lack of any perspective. For it is not the prospect but the nightmare of the ever-looming threat that is the only real way out of here. This way out is that a black, box-like ship appears on the sea, quickly and noiselessly sliding towards the shore. Its appearance plunges the inhabitants into a panic, as no one knows whether it is insured against being engulfed by the pitch-black darkness of the hold. Taking a certain number of them - those whom the burden of karma condemns to suffer in deeper layers - the ship departs. The prisoners in the hold do not see the route taken. They only feel that the movement horizontally is replaced by a spiraling descent, as if the ship is being dragged into the swirling Maelstrom. Skrivnus is limited to the expiatory sufferings of those whose conscience is not tarnished by memories of grave sins or crimes but whose consciousness in Enroth was separated from their will and influenced by the shelter of their surroundings.

The next layer is similar to the previous one, but it is darker, as if it is frozen in an indefinite twilight on the border of eternal night. There are no structures or crowds of people here, yet everyone feels the invisible presence of many others: traces of movements, similar to footprints, indicate their presence. This purgatory is called Ladref, and tens of millions experience a brief stay in it. This is the result of disbelief, which did not allow spiritual forces to penetrate the nature of man and ease his etheric body.

The one who is about to descend further perceives it subjectively as if he has fallen asleep and suddenly awakened in a changed environment. In reality, demonic creatures - the implementers of karma - transport him during forgetfulness to another time stream, although the number of spatial coordinates - three - remains unchanged in all Sheol layers.

Those who are redeeming their karma find themselves in complete darkness, where only the soil and rare plant equivalents weakly phosphoresce. Thanks to the glowing rocks, the landscape is not devoid of somber beauty in some places.

This is the last layer where there is still what we generally call Nature. The next layers will only have an urban landscape.

Here, in Morode, absolute silence reigns. Everyone who resides in this world does not perceive other inhabitants at all and is confident in their complete solitude. The sadness of great abandonment envelops him like an iron armor. It is in vain to struggle, pray, call for help, or search - everyone is left with only communication with their own soul. And the soul is guilty, its memory is stained with the evil done on earth, and for such a soul, there is nothing more frightening than solitude and silence.

Here, everyone understands the meaning and scale of the evil done on earth and drinks the cup of horror before their crime to the dregs. Nothing distracts the miserable from this endless dialogue with themselves, not even the struggle for existence. Because there is no struggle here, food is abundant everywhere, and some types of soil serve as it. Clothing? But in most layers, including Morode, the etheric body itself emits the fabric that clothes it - the one that we replace with clothing. And if in the worlds of Enlightenment it is beautiful and glowing, then in Morode, the creative impoverishment of its inhabitants only allows for the creation of etheric shreds.

However, a similar shabby robe also clothed the astral-etheric being of the one who was already redeeming in Ladref.

That whose conscience cannot be cleansed and Morod are no longer waiting for the descent to the next layer, but for a sudden and terrifying plunge into it; it is similar to a bog in which the unfortunate person unexpectedly finds himself and which sucks him in: first his legs, then his torso, and finally his head.

The narrative has reached Agra, the layer of black vapors, among which are interspersed, like islands, the black mirror reflections of the great cities of Enroth. This layer, like all purgatories, has no cosmic extension. Therefore, there is no sun, no stars, no moon here: the sky is perceived as a dense vault, enveloped in constant darkness. Some objects glow on their own, and the earth itself glows dimly, as if saturated with blood. The predominant color here is one: in Enroth we are unable to see it, and by the impression it produces, it is most likely dark crimson. It seems to be the same invisible light that is called infrared in physics.

I am very little familiar with Infra-Petersburg, barely at all. I remember that there is also a large, but black as ink, river and buildings that emit a bloody red glow. This is partly similar to the illuminations of our festive nights, but a horrifying likeness. The outward appearance of those who fell into this world resembles to some extent the appearance of gnomes: humanoid features are still preserved, but the forms are grotesque and impoverished. Their height is diminished. Their movements are slowed. Their body no longer radiates any materiality that would replace clothing; helplessness reigns naked. One of Agra's torments is the feeling of powerless shame and contemplation of his own misery. Another torment is that here for the first time he begins to experience a bitter pity for others like him and comes to understand his share of responsibility for their tragic fate.

The third torment of these unfortunate beings is fear. It is caused by the presence of other creatures in Agr, predatory demons called worgs. As we approached the building that made up the dark-etheric body of the Engineering Castle, I made out a creature sitting motionless on its roof. It was huge, the size of a Mesozoic-era lizard, and female, baggy and flabby, with gray, nostril-like skin. Poor thing, she was huddled against the tower, embracing it with her right paw and staring straight ahead with completely empty eye sockets, or so it seemed to me. She was deeply unhappy. It seemed to me that she was in agony, wanting desperately to scream or howl, but she had neither mouth nor jaws. However, feeling sorry for her could be dangerous, as a wicked predator was lurking, and anyone who was human could become a victim. In their animal fear of the worgs, the poor gnomes hid in corners or crept around, holding their breath, at the foot of the buildings that these monsters had taken a liking to. To be eaten, or rather sucked in by a worg through its porous skin, meant to die in Agr, only to re-emerge later, even lower down, in Bustviche or in the terrible Raphage. Later, I saw that there were many worgs, that they were partly intelligent, and that the crude, gloomy civilization that characterized Agr was precisely their creation. They had few mechanical devices to ease their labor. They manually piled up buildings made of some material that looked like trunks of giant trees in California, which I saw all around me, and each piece of this material, tightly joined to the others, began to glow with a dim crimson radiation that barely illuminated anything. What the connection was between the buildings of human cities in Enrof and the structures of the worgs in Agr remained unclear to me.

Of course, they did not have a spoken language, but they had something like a sign language. They built buildings, apparently, to shelter from the short, pouring rains that fell every minute. The rains were black.

It is strange, of course, that the worgs have not two sexes, but three. The male fertilizes the middle-sex individual, which carries the embryo inside for some time and then passes it on to the future mother.

But here and there in this civilization were scattered, like islands, silent buildings that did not shine at all. The Volgars did not even approach them: apparently, something invisible to me was hindering them. Such buildings rose in the place of St. Isaac's and some other temples in St. Petersburg: the only shelters from the Volgars where the martyrs of Agra could feel safe for a short time. Who built them? When? From what material? I do not know. Hunger did not allow the unfortunate to hide in these shelters: it drove them in search of edible mold covering the foundations of this joyless city.

If the heavy karma does not make the one who ends up here a victim of the Volgars and he does not wake up in the next world of the descending series, sooner or later he is destined for transformation, lifting him up. The one finishing his redemption gradually changes physically. He grows taller, his facial features begin to reappear, reminding him of the ones he had before, and the Volgars dare not approach him. The transformation itself occurs with the help of the brothers from Heavenly Russia: descending into Agra, they surround the one who has completed his task. Only those among the gnomes who will soon be lifted up from here in the same way can witness this event. But while they watch from the sidelines, it seems to them that the brothers of the Synod are lifting the freed one on their wings or on the folds of their glowing veils. The Volgars, seized with mystical awe and fear, watch this event from a distance but cannot understand anything.

The staircase of ascent is not closed to any demonic monad, not even to the Volgars. But such a transformation requires such sharp clarity of consciousness, which is almost never encountered here.

Sometimes something completely different appears here: in places, the landscape is diversified by glowing spots resembling huge decay spots. There is something of putrid green in them... This is another layer shining through in Agr: Bustvich. Everything there rots, but never completely decays; it exists in a state that combines living decay with spiritual lethargy, and Bustvich's agony lies in this. In Bustvich, those whose souls, burdened by the gravity of the flesh that is not illuminated by anything, have not developed any counterweight during their life on earth, untangle the knots of their karma. Here, the prisoner is consumed by depressing self-loathing because their ethereal body has turned into a likeness of excrement. For, as frightening and revolting as it may be, Bustvich is, in essence, nothing but impurities of Volgr. Here, physical torment begins to be added to spiritual torment: the prisoners' ability to move is extremely limited, as is their ability to defend themselves. And self-defense is urgently needed by each of them, because small humanoid demons, cloaked in dark ethereal bodies, dwell here between two incarnations in one of the demonic elemental worlds. Here they look like human-worms and are the size of a cat. They slowly and painfully devour those who were once humans in Enroth in Bustvich.

In the duplicate of the Engineering Castle (there is one in Bustvich too) at that time, in 1949, Emperor Paul I was located. He had already passed through a cycle of tortures in deeper layers and was now slowly being raised to Drukkarg - the abode of Russian anti-humanity. The severity of his misfortune struck me. But I was told that if part of his burden had not been lifted from him by the torture of his killing on the night of March 12 and instead, he had continued to tyrannize until his natural death, the burden of his deeds would have dragged him even deeper down, to the point of reaching Propulk - one of the most terrifying torments.

Following Bustvich is a purgatory called Rafag, where karmic consequences of betrayal and selfish devotion to tyranny are experienced. Rafag is the torment of continuous self-exhaustion, something that can be hinted at by phenomena of our world such as the suffering of cholera. This is the last layer, whose landscape at least remotely resembles our cities; there are no more shelters like those that loomed in Bustvich and Agre. The protection of humanity's cathedral prayers does not extend to Rafag; only the forces of synclites and higher hierarchies of Shadankar can penetrate deeper. Angels of darkness reign over the three last lower purgatories.

The first of these layers, Shim-big, is a slow stream moving through an indescribably gloomy world, enclosed under a high vault. It is difficult to understand where the half-light, dead and colorless, originates from. The slightest rain falls on the stream, bubbling up with small bubbles on its surface. The souls tormented here, in their degraded etheric bodies, resemble smoky-brown shreds, not just their clothing. They sway back and forth, clinging to anything to avoid falling into the stream. Their agony is not only horror; an even greater torture is the sense of shame, which is nowhere as strong as in Shim-big, and the burning longing for a real body, for the soft warm world - memories of the joys of life on earth. Compassion is intensified here.

The mouth of the stream is very close to sight. And both the stream and the entire tunnel-like world end there, just as a subway tunnel ends when it emerges onto an elevated structure. But the waters do not flow into anything; they, the banks, and the vault - all dissolve into a gray, objectless desert. There can be no body there, nor any hint of a medium or environment. Only one thing does not extinguish there: the spark of self-awareness. This purgatory is called Dromn: the illusion of a terrible non-existence.

And if those who bear responsibility for several human deaths, even if they were the deaths of criminals, have cleansed themselves in Shim-big, then in Dromna there are those whose violation of the Law seems, in our view, infinitely smaller. Yes, the arithmetic of karma is a strange arithmetic! And in Dromna, they are not drawn to villainy, to bloodshed, but only to the karmic consequence of active godlessness, militant denial of spirituality, active affirmation of the false idea of the mortality of the soul. The mystery of this amazing, disproportionate, seemingly unjust punishment lies in the fact that all these acts of willpower in Enroth during life, as it were, completely blocked the soul's respiratory pathways. The result was an even greater burden on the etheric nature than even as a result of individual crimes taken in isolation, by themselves. The prisoner of Dromna feels that there is nothing anywhere, not even himself, just as it was portrayed to him in life. And with the greatest effort, he can barely come to terms with the striking fact of the persistence of the self-aware I even here, in absolute emptiness, contrary to reason and common sense. At the same time, he begins to vaguely understand that everything could have been different if he had not chosen this non-being or semi-being himself.

But the melancholy of voluntary abandonment, tinting the stay in Dromna, gradually begins to give way to anxiety. He feels that he is being pulled somewhere, as if downwards and sideways, and it itself turns from a point into an elongated figure, directed downwards. The absence of any landmarks makes it impossible to understand whether he is falling slowly or descending rapidly. Only the internal feeling cries louder than any logic, that he is moving not upwards or sideways, but precisely downwards. And there, at the bottom, a pink space is already outlined. For a few moments, this color may even seem joyful to the falling one. But then a chilling horror pierces the unfortunate Self: it understands that it is inexorably descending into a hot, quiet, almost iron sea. The weight of the falling one rapidly increases; and there, he touches the hot red surface of Fukabirn and sinks into its midst. The agony consists, apart from the burning physical pain, precisely in the horror of descending into eternal torment - a descent that seems irretrievable.

Fukabirn is the last purgatory in the sakuala. Now begins the sakuala of transphysical magmas: these local worlds coexist in three-dimensional space, but in different streams of time, with belts of molten matter in the planet's shell. I repeat, emphasize: in all metacultures except the Indian, the sufferings of these worlds had no end until Jesus Christ made that liberating descent into them, which in church tradition is called the descent of the Savior into hell. From this moment on, it becomes possible, although requiring immense efforts, for the forces of Light to extract the sufferers from these abysses after a certain period necessary to untie the knots of personal karma.

The first of the magmas is Okrus, the viscous bottom of Fukabirn. Around the shelter, there were no old shells left in Dromna, and a new corporeal being began to form. In Okrus, its formation is nearing completion, but there is nothing in it even remotely resembling a human form: it is a spherical something made of living inframetal.

So why the torments of Fukabirn and Okrus, why? Oh, there are already few of these sufferers. In Skrivnus and Ladrefe, there were millions tormented, here - hundreds, maybe even tens. The condemnation of ideological enemies to great torment, the condemnation of the innocent, the torture of the defenseless, the torment of children - all this is redeemed by suffering here, in Okrus and Fukabirn.

Here, the tormented one remembers clearly the religious teachings heard on Earth and that he was warned. Physical torments are subjectively felt here as retribution, but the dual nature of the Law and responsibility for its cruelty not of God, but of demonic forces is beginning to be realized. Consciousness clears: this is the manifestation of the Providential side of the Law, its ancient foundation, which was created by the demiurges even before the invasion of Gagtung into Shadanakar. Clarification of consciousness, clarification of conscience, increase of spiritual thirst - this is the retaliatory side of the Law that the bright forces defended from the dark, thanks to which the Law did not become absolute evil.

The infra-physical substance of magma is very similar to their physical substance. Their prisoners at first retain freedom of movement, but there is no need for actions to maintain existence here: strength is absorbed mechanically from the surrounding environment. All of this also applies to the second of the magma belts, Gvegru, which represents a bright red, immovable medium. However, I would like to remind you that suffering in Enroth - whatever it may be - weakens posthumous torment, primarily in terms of reducing its duration, but sometimes also in terms of its "quality". The duration of the atoning punishment of the soul after death is mainly determined by the scale of the victims who suffered from its actions in Enroth. Mass crimes lead to a decrease in the layers of retribution: Okrus can be replaced, for example, by Ukairvair, Gvegr - by Propulk. The point is that bodily torments, which began in Fukabirn and increased in Okrus and Gvegr, reach their peak in the next layer, called Ukairvair: this is raging magma. There, those who perverted high and bright ideas, who are responsible for the mutilation of transphysical paths of thousands and millions, atone for themselves. There are also those who are guilty of heinous acts called conscious sadism in our dry, dead language - that is, such actions where the suffering of others not only caused a sense of pleasure, but the wrongfulness of this pleasure was completely clear to the criminal at the time. It was realized - but it did not prevent enjoyment, did not prevent them from experiencing it again and again. Fortunately, time flows much faster here. A well-known writer of our day, guilty not of conscious sadism, but of the substitution of ideals, the distortion of ideas, and the poisoning of many minds with lies, for example, thought that he would spend not ten years here, as it was in Enroth time, but only a few days.

Next comes Propulk - solid magma: a world of redemptive suffering for the mass executioners, perpetrators of bloody wars, and tormentors of the people. Freedom of movement is lost. The body is as if walled up in solid composition, compressed on all sides. But even the most terrible physical agony is surpassed here by the suffering of the soul. This is such a burning repentance and such a longing for God that are impossible in any of the higher levels. Fortunately, few descend to Propulk. Need it be said that creatures like Yezhov or Beria's henchmen are here? It is remarkable that not long ago Maluta Skuratov continued to languish here, and in Propulk of the Western metacultures, not only Robespierre and Saint-Just, but even some of the Inquisitors of the 16th century have not yet untied their karma.

Sakuala magma is completed by a layer called Yrl - this is super-heavy magma. Here, physical suffering completely fades before spiritual torment. Yrl is created for retribution for those whom we would call recidivists in our legal language: those who, having already experienced the descent into magma and returned to Enroth, have burdened themselves again with great wickedness.

The magmas have ended. Below begins the Sakuala worlds, related to the physical core of the planet, common to all metacultures.

First comes Biask, the infrared caves, the worst of the Crimson Hells, if we define the entire ladder of layers from Fukabirn to Biask. The shape here changes, a semblance of a head and four legs appear. But the gift of speech is lost, as there is no one to talk to: each of the prisoners is isolated from the rest of the world and sees only their torturers - those who, strangely enough, resemble the infamous demons. Sitting here in Enroth, in relative safety, one can laugh as much as they want at the belief in the existence of these horned monsters, but one should not even wish for closer acquaintance with them to a mortal enemy. And since there are only dozens of victims who have fallen in Biask, while the demons in need of their gavvahs are a great multitude, they extract gavvahs from their victims by all means they can come up with. The victims of Biask are those who were spirit corrupters in Enroth. Such crimes are considered so severe because they cause more karmic damage to thousands of human souls. Even an executioner whose hands have killed hundreds of people physically has not caused such harm as those who are mentioned in the Gospel: "But whoever causes one of these little ones who believe in Me to stumble, it would be better for him to have a heavy millstone hung around his neck, and to be drowned in the depth of the sea" (Matt. 18:6). And even if Yaroslavsky or Bedny were good people in their private lives, it would not save them from the posthumous fate awaiting spirit corrupters.

Below Biask yawns Amiutza: vertical fissures. The falling one seems to get stuck, suspended in complete helplessness. And since the fissures lead to Gashsharva, the unfortunate one ends up hanging directly above the nesting place of the demonic forces of Shadanakar. Here are those who combined conscious sadism with the enormity of villainy.

But from the vertical fissures of Amiutza there are also side dead-end passages. This is Ytrech, a planetary night that lasts from the beginning of the formation of Shadanakar to the end of the existence of our planet in Enroth, that is, until the expiration of the second (future) zone. There were very few here, for example, Ivan the Terrible. And then there is another layer, quite special: only Judas Iscariot's deed corresponds to it. It is called Zhursh, and no one has ever entered this layer except for Judas.

Clearly, of course, we cannot even begin to imagine the sufferings experienced in the layers of the core. And now the description has come to the last of the layers - the cemetery of Shadanakar. I could not make out its name exactly: sometimes it seemed to be pronounced as Sufel, and sometimes Sufetkh seemed more correct to me, and the question remained unresolved. Here, those who persisted in evil in the lower torments are descended. Here their shells - remnants of the shelter - are discarded as monads. Monads fall out of Shadanakar altogether, to start all over again in unimaginable spaces, times, and forms. And yet this is better than falling through the Pit of Shadanakar to the Galactic Pit: here the monad does not fall out, at least not from Cosmic Time.

But the shell is alive, self-aware, though the lowest "self"; in Sufetkh it barely moves, gradually exhaling the remnants of life force. This is the second death spoken of in the Sacred Scriptures. The spark of consciousness flickers until the end, and the measure of its suffering exceeds the imagination of even the demons themselves. No one from the Light has yet been able to reach here throughout human history, not even the Planetary Logos. The brothers of the synclites can sometimes see Sufetkh, but not from the inside, only from neighboring layers. Then they distinguish a desert over which the anti-cosmos Gagtungra stands with a dimly lilac sun, Gashsharva.

Fortunately, only a few hundred monads have fallen to Sufetkh throughout human history. Of these, only a few have left a mark in history, because all the large monads of the descending trend are drawn into Gashsharva. In Sufetkh are those who are not needed by Gagtungra. Of historical figures, I only know of one - Domitian, in his next incarnation after falling into Propulk, becoming the Marshal Jules de Recz, who was at first a follower of Joan of Arc, and then a villain and sadist who bathed in tubs made from the entrails of the children he had killed. Thrown into Yrl, he again tarnished himself with great evil deeds in the era of the Inquisition in his next incarnation in Enrof. After his third death, he cut through all the layers of the underworld again, reached Sufetkh, and was thrown out of Shadanakar like slag.

I know well that the humanistic consciousness of our time would like to encounter completely different pictures than those outlined by me in this chapter. Some will be discouraged by the fact that my testimonies will seem too reminiscent, despite all the differences, of popular images whose origin is in historical Christianity. Others will be shocked by the savage severity of the laws and the material nature of the horrifying torments in the places of suffering. But to the former, I am ready to ask: did they seriously think that the teachings of the Church Fathers contain nothing but the play of frightened imagination? Only a non-religious consciousness, like a tractor or a rolling mill, can assume, for example, that we are able to exhaust the meaning of the Divine Comedy, interpreting it as a sum of artistic techniques, political hatred, and poetic fantasies. In the first part of Dante's work, he showed a descending ladder of layers that existed in the Middle Ages in the infraphysics of Roman Catholic metaculture. We must learn to peel off the impurities introduced into this picture for the sake of artistic demands or due to aberrations inherent in the epoch, from the expression of true transphysical experience, unprecedented and stunning. And it seems to me that it will not be superfluous to point out that now the one who was Dante is among the few greatest spirits of humanity who are capable of penetrating unimpeded to the very bottom of Shadanakar.

And to those who are outraged by the severity of the laws, one can answer one thing: then work on their enlightenment! Of course, with the intellectual habits of the humanistic era, it would be easier to imagine not material torments, but, so to speak, spiritual ones: pangs of conscience, longing for the inability to love, and the like. Unfortunately, these barbaric laws were obviously created without taking into account the mood of the XX century intelligentsia. True, spiritual suffering also has a significant value in the descending layers. In essence, only great criminals in history are subjected to material suffering predominantly, and even such that is more severe than any physical pain of ours because physical pain yields to ether in strength and duration. But even then, one must say: imagining the amount of suffering inflicted on these people by their victims in Enroth, will the mountain of torment be balanced on the scales of the impartial Law of Karma by pangs of conscience or, as Dostoevsky thought, longing for the inability to love?

And each of us is free to join those who are working to mitigate this Law.

### Chapter 3. Shrastres and witzraoras

I am approaching the description of worlds that have a special significance for humanity with its history and for the entire Shadanakar, as it is these worlds that were created by demonic forces as a direct tool for implementing the world plan of Gagtungra.

These are, in fact, two rows, two sakualas of infra-physical layers closely related to each other.
I have already briefly mentioned that each meta-culture includes a certain antipole to its zatomis, a certain citadel of demonic forces where the sacred cities of synclites are reflected as if turned upside down by black mirrors. We are talking about shrastres, the dwellings of anti-humanity.

Shrastres are various regions of a single four-dimensional spatial world; each of them, however, has its own unique number of temporal coordinates. The ring of shrastres is meta-geologically linked to the lower layers of the earth's crust, with its compensatory protrusions, and opposes the dark doubles-antipodes of Eanna, Olympus, Paradise,  Montsalvat, Heavenly Russia, and other zatomis. The compensatory protrusions that balance the mountain ranges on the surface of the earth are directed with their tips and ridges towards the center of the planet. In Enrofe, these areas are lifeless and dead: basalt, lava, and nothing more. But it is not the same in the four-dimensional world. Below, towards the center, there is a void - a reddish, flickering cavity with waves of light and heat. In the underbelly of the crust, the resultant of two attractions dominates: towards the thickness of the crust - and towards the center of the earth; the concepts of top and bottom do not coincide with ours. In the underground orange-red sky, almost black infralilac and infrared celestial bodies stand motionless: this is how Gaasharva and the torments of the earth's core are perceived from there. In the rays of these moons, those multi-million societies and monstrous hierarchies live and strengthen their citadels, which manifest themselves in front of our eyes in great powers, in state tyrannies, in faceless vampires of world history.

What kind of nature and landscape dominate on this side of the world? There are no blue and green colors here, as they could not be perceived by its inhabitants. Instead, there are two colors that our eyes cannot perceive. There is also a certain resemblance of vegetation, but it is burning and frightening: piles of massive dark-red bushes, and in some places, large, separate, moving flowers made of flame. The relief is very uneven; lakes and seas of white and pink lava are interspersed with the masses of land. Overall, the landscape has a peculiar geological-urban character: giant multi-million cities, in Infra-Russia, for example, the main one of them is almost entirely connected to the compensatory protrusion of the Anti-Ural, another corresponds to the Caucasus, and now cities are being created on compensatory protrusions of the mountains of Kazakhstan and Tian Shan. There are also cities under our lowlands, but less frequently, as these areas are mostly filled with lava.

The anti-humanity consists mainly of two races or breeds that are very different from each other. The main ones are small but highly intelligent creatures that move in a circle of reincarnations in the shrasts, where they take on a four-dimensional form somewhat reminiscent of ours. This body, corresponding to our physical one, is called the Karrokh, and is formed from the materiality of these layers created by higher demonic hierarchies. The inhabitants of the shrasts have a pair of upper and lower limbs, although they have a different number of fingers than we do, and they are also equipped with something like skin wings. Their red stalk-like eyes protruding from the sides of their cylindrical heads, their mouse-grey skin, and elongated tubular mouth could cause disgust in a person. But these creatures are possessors of acute intelligence and creators of a high civilization that in some ways surpasses ours. They are called igvas.

The Igvas first appeared in the shrast of the Babylonian-Assyrian metaculture. In older shrasts, there was another race, ancestors of the current Raruggs, about which I will speak later. However, the origin of the Igvas is not entirely clear to me: it is necessary to deal with such strange ideas that reason cannot accept them. The fact is that although there are no monads among humans that are demonic in nature, there have been cases - exceptionally rare, however - when a person voluntarily became an Igva later on their path. In addition to the desire, this requires colossal clarity of consciousness and unique development of specific abilities. Such was the founder of anti-humanity, a personality that really existed in Erech and Babylon, where he was a priest of Nergal, and had a long chain of incarnations in older cultures and among the titans of humanity.

The Igvas originated from the combination of this being with Lilith. Sometimes she can take on female forms in denser worlds, but only very rarely and only by the will of Gagtungra. When she appeared in Babylon, it was as if she suddenly appeared out of nowhere to human eyes. Three people saw her: the future father of Igvas and two others, one of whom went insane and the other was executed. The one for whom she took on this ghostly physical form coupled with her astral and then etheric body. Then she descended, engulfed in flames, into the empty infraphysical layer, where she gave birth to the first group of Igvas. The founder of this race was not incarnated again in shrasts or Enrof. Now he is in Digma, and his participation in the development and implementation of the demonic plan is very significant.

The Igvas have a monosyllabic sound language. Phonetically, it is closest to Chinese among our languages, but due to the tubular structure of the mouth, vowel sounds like "o" and "u" dominate among the Igvas.

They sometimes wear clothing, but more often walk around naked. The excessive intellectualism of these beings has dried up their sexual sphere. The method of reproduction is similar to that of humans, but less attractive. They mate almost on the move, without feeling the need for privacy, as they are devoid of shame. Feelings of love, attachment, and compassion are in their infancy. Instead of a family, they have short-term unions, and for offspring, they have carefully equipped and meticulously planned nurseries.

Morality is slavery. Society consists of two classes: the higher intellect, which includes scientists, engineers, priests, and, if applicable, administrators - and the majority who only act on the orders of their leadership. However, even the leadership is strictly subordinate to the will of the so-called "great igv" (something like the supreme priest-emperors who follow one another in succession) and the will of the monsters from the neighboring layer - the witzraors. In each of the strata, the great igv is virtually the unlimited ruler. The strata is not a monarchy and certainly not a theocracy - it is a satanocracy. The principle of dynastic inheritance of power is completely alien to igvs. Successors are chosen and prepared for decades with amazing rationality and foresight. The clarity of the consciousness of the great igvs is immense, although they perceive the entire world upside down, from a demonic point of view. They are capable of foreseeing even the anti-cosmos of the Galaxy; they are constantly enveloped by the Gagtung. After the death of the great igvs, they rise directly to the Digm.

It would be wrong to say that there is an equivalent of our science and technology in the strata - rather, our science and technology are the equivalent of the science and technology of the igvs. Different conditions and laws of those layers have determined a different content of their science compared to ours, but the methods of scientific research and the principles of technology are quite similar to ours. However, they, far ahead of us on this path, are familiar with such techniques and methods that are reminiscent of our magic, and many of us would consider it witchcraft. But they even use the principles of screws, wheels, and rockets. There are ships for sailing on the lakes of infralava. As strange as it may seem, regular flights have been practiced between the strata for a long time, and even tourism is well-developed - of course, not for aesthetic purposes, but only for educational purposes.

Aviation is also at a high level, although the igvs themselves are able to move at high speeds, often balancing upside down and landing on the ceilings and walls of buildings like flies.

Science gave the Igva the ability to penetrate to the surface of the Earth. In their infra-physical layer, this surface is dead and barren, like the surface of the Moon. And since the space of Sakuala's strata fades at the boundaries of the solar system, there are no stars in this sky. But the Igva saw the planets and the Sun, although in a completely different way than we do. The temperature in the strata is very high (it would be unbearable for us), and therefore the Sun, which appeared to the Igva as a dim infrared spot, emits heat that is not sufficient for them. Despite all the measures of self-protection taken against the cold, the pioneering Igva suffered cruelly on the surface of the Earth; this surface is still as unsuitable for their existence as the depth of Antarctica is for us. However, they have some ways of mastering this surface, and not in their own layer, but in ours.

Scientific equipment has already allowed them to detect the shadows of Enroth. Perhaps almost inevitably, they will let us know about themselves over time, exchange and contact, but of course, they will influence humanity in a direction that is desirable for them. After all, their most cherished hope, uniting their dream, is to spread their dominion with the help of witzraor and Gagthungar to all layers of Shadanakar. It seems that the great anti-god of the Future, being prepared in Gash-sharve for birth among humanity in the near future, will create a couple of half-human, half-Igva in Enroth. From here, the Igva race will go in our layer. Reproducing rapidly, like fish, they must gradually replace humans, turning the surface of the earth into a habitat for demon-humanity.

The Igvas move in a circle of incarnations in the shrastras, and in the intervals between them, they undergo the same thing: their shell, together with the astral, falls to the Pit (incarnation in the superheavy body of the Pit is impossible without the astral), passing as if tangentially through the magmas and Gashsharvu, barely touching them. During this descent, their etheric bodies rapidly scatter in droplets. Cases of enlightenment among the Igvas are rare to the point of singularity, and then their post-death, of course, changes. Oh God, all of them, except for partly the great ones, have a reversed concept of the world tyrant, more terrible than Gagtungur. Christ, about whom they hear from the great Igvas, is in their representation in the position of the Antichrist - as a rebellious and extremely dangerous despot; in general, everything is turned upside down. Therefore, it is natural that their cult consists mainly of ecstatic demon-worship, the emanations of which rise to Gagtungur.

Oh, the civilization of the Igvas is not limited to science and technology: it includes some arts as well. In front of the grand conical mound in Drukkarge, the main city of Russian anti-humanity, which represents a mountain carved from the inside, there is a monstrous sculpture: a pre-Igva riding on a Rarugga. If you convert to our units of length (and this is perfectly legal in many cases), you can say that the eyes of the Igva in this sculpture are depicted with cinnabar-red stones the size of our two-story house, and the dark-crimson eyes of the Rarugga are many times larger.

But the development of the arts is hindered by the rational temperament of the Igvi psyche and their weak emotionalism. Along with the overall ugliness of their concepts, all of this has directed their art along paths where our aesthetic criteria are inapplicable. Architecture has received the greatest development in the shrastras. Cities have been formed from structures of superhuman proportions, but with bare geometric forms. Partially, these are rocks hollowed out from the inside and faced on the outside. Cubes, rhombuses, truncated pyramids shine with facings of red, gray, and brown colors. The style of constructivism in human architecture is a certain hint of the style of shrastras. It took an enhanced inspiration of the creative subconscious of the people by the bright forces of Fongaranda for human architecture not to succumb to the impulses rising from the shrastras and not to turn the city of Enroth into pitiful imitations of the stereometric cities of the Igvi. And there, in these cities, music rages, mainly noise, sounding cacophonous to our ears, but sometimes rising to such rhythmic constructions that can enchant some of us. Dance plays an even greater role in the lives of the Igvi, if it is permissible to apply this word to their grotesque bacchanalia. And their demon worship, combining striking light effects, deafening sounds of giant instruments, and ecstatic dance-flight in the space of four coordinates, turns into mass frenzy: this is how the angels of darkness are attracted, and the energy emitted during this process is absorbed by Gagtung.

Apart from igvs, other creatures, aborigines of this inverted world, also inhabit the shrasts - rarruggi, an ancient breed that looks partly like centaurs, partly like dark angels, and, above all, as if they are Mesozoic lizards that have taken to the air. They have taken to the air, but not like the pterodactyls with their bat-like wings in Enrof: the wings of rarruggi are mighty and straightened to the sides of an enormously huge body. Under the laws of gravity in Enrof, such a massive flying organism would be impossible.

Their resemblance to lizards is not accidental: rarruggi are these lizards. After long incarnations in the bodies of allosaurs, tyrannosaurs, and pterodactyls, some of the most predatory species of them entered the path of further development in the layers of infraphysics. Over millions of years, they have reached the stage of reason, but this reason is still far from the sophisticated intellectualism of igvs. However, their physical power and incredible emotional intensity of their spiritual life are such that after a long struggle for this layer of being, igvs were forced to reconcile with the close proximity of rarruggi. Soon, a peculiar modus vivendi was developed between the two races, which later turned into an alliance. Now, rarruggi are like the intelligent cavalry of shrasts, their army. The igvs themselves only participate in wars in extreme cases, and usually they are only responsible for the management, especially the technical part. The clumsy brains of rarruggi are still unable to cope with the tasks of military equipment. But their incredible bloodthirstiness, their warlike nature, and fearlessness are necessary conditions for victorious wars in this layer. Ancient notions of demonic winged horses are echoes of knowledge about the existence of rarruggi.

And wars on the reverse side of the world are twofold. In the past, the history of these satanocracies was largely reduced to mutual rivalry and armed struggle. Of course, not all wars of humanity were related to battles in this grim world, but our great wars undoubtedly were. During the strongest of these wars, some shrasts underwent catastrophic changes and even perished. Now it has become more difficult: the highest demonic institutions are making every effort to strengthen peace between the shrasts. The reasons for this are very complex and will be gradually explained in the future. Truly, the irreconcilable struggle is not between the shrasts, but between the igvas, raruggas, and witsraorams on one side, and the synclitams of zatomis, angels, demons, and the very demiurges of super-peoples on the other.

After the metaculture completes its cycle of existence in Enroth, its shrast endures gloomy days resembling constant starvation agony. Such shrasts are no longer needed by Gauntlgrym and are left to their own devices.^^1

^^1: Names of shrasts that completed in Enroth's metaculture: Dabb - the shrast of Atlantis, Bubgish - the shrast of Gondwana, Seth - of Ancient Egypt, Tartarus - of Greco-Roman culture, Nergal - of Babylonian-Assyrian culture, Devan - of Iran, Zing - of Judaism, Babylon - of Byzantium. The last name is based, it seems, on an inaccurate interpretation of the symbols of the Apocalypse. "Babylon" in the Revelation should be understood not as a Byzantine shrast, but as the devilish humanity of the Future.

Igvy and raruggi are degrading, the progressive movement of science and technology is coming to a halt. The destruction of corresponding aggressive state entities in Enrof leads to the cessation of the main food source for uitzraorov and igv - food that I will discuss in more detail below. Degenerating residents of shrastra are forced to survive through small-scale predation, simply stealing food from more fortunate neighbors, or languishing on a "vegetarian table". Such is the fate of some shrastra, whose metaculture still exists in Enrof, but whose uitzraoras have been destroyed in mutual struggle, and the great underground cities have been destroyed.^^2

Strong and active shrastry now number four. These are Fu-zhu, the shrastr of China, ancient but recently given a new impulse to development; Yunukamn - the shrastr of Roman Catholic metaculture, true, greatly weakened and lagging, but still active^^3; Drukkarg - the shrastr of Russian metaculture, and Mudgabr - the most powerful of all shrastra, the underside of the great culture of the Northwest. Its founder was the human-igv Klingzor; in his last incarnation in Enrof, he was one of the anonymous inspirers of the execution of Jesus Christ, a conscious supporter of Gag-tung, disguised as a Pharisee and patriot. The anti-Monsalvat founded by him no longer resembles the naively patriarchal images that, with a delay, passed from the legends of the Middle Ages to Wagner's musical dramas. Science and civilization of igv has never advanced as far as in Mudgabr. I note that it was the igvy of this shrastr who were the first to penetrate the desert and lifeless surface of their world. However, the life of shrastry is closely intertwined with the existence of a completely different and demonic creatures whose layers of habitation make up the neighboring sakuala - neighboring, but actively interacting with the shrastra of sakuala. Igvy and raruggi are not yet able to transition into these layers, but the inhabitants of the neighboring sakuala - uitzraorov - can and do enter, or rather, crawl into the cities of igv.

^^2: Aru is a component of the Indomalayan metaculture, Alphok is of the Muslim culture, and Tugibd is of the Indian culture. The last two can still be revived in connection with the emergence of the new Indian and new Muslim lineages of witsraws.
^^3: The Inquisition was an unprecedented metahistorical phenomenon - the most terrible offspring of Gagtowngra. There was nothing like it before or after in any metaculture. It resided in Gashsharve, and many bright forces fought against it; the final blow was dealt only in the 18th century by the great humanist John the Theologian. Now it has been expelled from Shadanakar to the Galactic Pit. The papacy is not entirely free from the envelopment of demonic forces and therefore has not fully condemned this terrible historical stage.

These are powerful creatures that play a role in history and meta-history that is as huge as their physical size. If you imagine the head of this creature in the place of Moscow, its tentacles would reach the sea. They move with breathtaking speed, possess the gift of speech, and great cunning. Their origin is complex and ambivalent. Each race of witzraor appeared on the world stage as the fruit of the union of "kaross," that is, local, national manifestations of Lilith, the "All-People's Aphrodite" of humanity, with the demiurges of super-nations. In most metacultures, these creatures were created by the will of the demiurges as protectors of the super-nation from external enemies. They first appeared in the Babylonian metaculture: its demiurge tried to oppose this creation to the warring egregores of Egypt and Media, which threatened the very existence of the Babylonian super-nation. But the karosses carry the cursed seed of Gagtungra, which was abandoned by Lilith in the remote past and which they represent as separate national-cultural expressions. And the seed of Gagtungra predetermined that the first witzraor, at first fulfilling the will of the demiurge, soon transformed into a transphysical bearer of the great-power state of Babylon. His aggressiveness pushed the demiurges of other super-nations to extreme measures to protect their countries in Enrof against the conqueror. These measures consisted of their creation of similar creatures capable of resisting the Babylonian witzraor. Thus, these monsters appeared in Iranian and Jewish metacultures, and then in all others.

The reproduction of these extremely aggressive and deeply unhappy creatures occurs through a process resembling budding. They are devoid of gender. Each offspring immediately becomes a deadly enemy of its parent and a potential killer. This gave rise to dynasties of uitzraors in metacultures, who inherited from each other after the parent was killed and its heart was eaten. In most metacultures, there is only one uitzraor or one uitzraor-parent and one or several of its offspring, all engaged in a desperate struggle. The struggle and destruction of uitzraors by each other is one of the most monstrous spectacles in metahistory.

Throughout Russia's historical existence, three ruling uitzraors have been replaced, but before each one died, its offspring appeared, which it was able to eat itself. However, in the metaculture of the Northwest, a different situation arose: there were and still are several dynasties of uitzraors simultaneously, and this circumstance has had enormous historical consequences for the whole world, as the presence of several such dynasties prevented and prevents the unification of the Northwest super-people into a single whole. This circumstance became a prerequisite for all the great European wars, as well as both world wars.

Witsraors inhabit a desert world similar to a hot tundra; it is divided into individual zones corresponding to the borders of the metaculture. Each Witsraor can enter not only neighboring zones (of course, only after defeating neighboring Witsraors), but also shrastries: there it crawls like a foggy mountain. Igvas and raruggi tremble, hearing its voice, as before a lord and a despot, but at the same time they see in it a great defender against other shrastries and against the forces of Light. How would they fight against the armies of synclites and the Demiurge without it? - It is precisely the various collisions of the struggle between Witsraors among themselves, as well as each of them with the Demiurge and synclite of the given metaculture, that is, to a significant extent, the transphysical aspect of the process that we perceive as political and historical.

Witsraors see Enroph vaguely, humans and our landscape - dimly and distorted, but they love our world with a hot, insatiable passion. They would like to embody themselves here - and cannot. They see Gagtungra up close and tremble before it like slaves. They consider the great igvas, in their limitedness, only as executors of their will; in reality, the great igva sees higher and deeper than they do, knows more and strives to use the greed, militancy, and power of Witsraors in the interests of anti-humanity.

What sustains the life force of the witzraor? The mechanism of this process is not simple. The witzraor emits a unique psychic energy in giant quantities, which penetrates into Enroth. Perceived by the sphere of the unconscious in human psyche, it manifests among human societies in the form of a complex of national and state feelings. Reverence for their state (not for the people or country, but specifically for the state with its power), experiencing oneself as a participant in the grand activity of the great power, cult of emperors or leaders, burning hatred for their enemies, pride in the material prosperity and external victories of their state, national complacency, militancy, bloodthirstiness, conqueror enthusiasm - all these feelings, which are revealed already within the limits of human consciousness, can grow, swell, and hypertrophy only thanks to this witzraorial energy. At the same time, people's psyche enriches these discharges of energy with its own contributions, inherent only to it. A peculiar psycho-radiation of the masses arises, with dual nature and reverse direction. It descends through the earth's crust, penetrates into neighboring infra-layers, and appears as a viscous red dew on the shrastrov soil. The Igvi collect it for the witzraor - this is their main obligation to them - and they themselves feed on the remnants: subsistence on plant food not only oppresses and burdens them but also cannot protect them from degradation.

It is quite possible that I am simplifying or not entirely correctly describing the mechanism of this process, but its essence - the feeding of the witzraor with the psycho-radiations of the peoples, and specifically the radiations associated with the emotions of the state complex - is not only a very serious fact but also the cause of countless disasters.

Igvy do not belong to the layers of the Uitzraors, but they see them as if from outside, vaguely, as shadows. Hiding in the shrubs, they observe battles between the Uitzraor and the Demiurge, trying their best to pour as much nourishing dew as possible into the enraged mass of the demon. They do not see the Demiurge, but this invisibility of someone mighty and bright, capable of fighting the demon of great power, instills in them feelings of horror and sharp hostility. They know that the death of the Uitzraor entails, along with the death of the statehood in Enroth (this could even cause their rejoicing, if a young, stronger state had to arise in the place of the old one), the death of the entire dynasty of Uitzraors or the destruction of the shrub. This predetermines the death of the warring states of this metaculture, at least for many centuries.

As I strive to share everything I know, even things that may seem insignificant, in the footnote I list the names of the extinct dynasties of the Witzraorovs, while in the text I list the currently existing ones.

So, there's Istarra - the Witzraor of Spain; Nissush - the Mongol-Manchu-Japanese dynasty; currently coexisting with Nissush is the hybrid La-Choy, a mixture of Nissush and the Russian Zhruhr; Zhruhr himself; and finally, Vaggag - the common name for the Witzraors of the Northwest, who live in their layer, as I've already mentioned, several at a time. There are currently three of them: English (Ustr), French (Bartad), and the abandoned offshoot of Zhruhr in their layer - the Yugoslav Charmich. All of these Witzraors are not the first in their line: their dynasties^^4 appeared in past centuries. But in the 20th century, completely new dynasties emerged as a result of the combination of demiurges with metacultural carosses, which took place in modern times. These include Shostar - the Witzraor of the New Arab, born after the defeat of the Ottoman Empire and seeking to assert himself in one or another of the Muslim states, starting with Kemalist Turkey; Avardal - the Witzraor of the New Indian, born a few years ago due to the same fateful necessity to protect the metaculture; Stebing - the Witzraor of the United States of America, with something tiger-like in his appearance and a golden cone on his head; and also Ukurmia - the Witzraor of the New German, born after the collapse of the Third Reich and the demise of the old dynasty of Witzraors. The Demiurge of the Northwest was forced to repeat the fateful step, as there was no other way out. The new creation is less ferocious than its predecessor: unheard-of efforts are being made to inspire it from very high worlds of Light. Before him, for the first time before the Witzraors, there is the possibility of an ascending path, and there is something royal in his appearance, most likely - lion-like. After all, until now, none of the Witzraors knew of any afterlife other than falling into Uppum, a special hell for the Witzraors - the Rain of Eternal Grief, created once by Gaghtungr for the dragon of the Primongolian metaculture who turned to the Light. Later, Uppum was completely sealed off, and there can be no release from there, at least in this aeon.
____________
^^4: Unidr - Uitzraors of Babylon, Assyria, and Carthage; Forsuf - Macedonia and Rome; Foshch - Judaism; Ahriman - Iran (strangely enough, the use of this name for the demon of great power statehood); Kharada - Uitzraors of India; Efror - caliphates, old Turkey, and Turkic-Muslim empires. The names of the Uitzraors of Byzantium, medieval states of Southeast Asia associated with the Aru shrub, but quite weak, are unknown to me.

I have a few words to say about Drukarg, the only one of the shrasts whose memories arise in my daily memory circle. The center of the main city of Drukarg is a structure about a kilometer high: a temple. I have already spoken about the statue of Praigva riding on the spread wings of Rarugga, and if the distant resemblance of this statue should be considered the Bronze Horseman in Enrof, then something completely different, familiar to us, is physically connected to the temple: a mausoleum. The main city is surrounded by a circular citadel consisting of concentric circles. In one of them, the Ideal Cathedral Soul of Russia, Navna, languishes. At the third Zhruge, the situation worsened: a dense vault was erected over it. Now her shining voice barely appears in places, like a bluish, invisible glow to Igwams and Raruggams, on the surface of the cyclopean walls. And outside of Drukarg, only those who believe in earthly Russia and those enlightened in heavenly Russia can hear her voice. Who is Navna? That which unites Russians into a single nation; that which calls and pulls individual Russian souls upward and upward; that which envelops Russian art with its unique fragrance; that which stands above the purest and highest female images of Russian fairy tales, literature, and music; that which gives birth to the longing in Russian hearts for the high, the special, and the destined duty of Russia alone - all of this is Navna. Its cathedral nature is in the fact that something from each Russian soul rises to Navna, enters it, is protected in it, and merges with its own self. It can also be said that a kind of spiritual energy present in every person entering the body of the nation resides in Navna. Navna is the bride of the demiurge of Russia and the captive of Zhruge.

Jrugr, like all other Uiцraory, cannot have any children except for occasionally budding Jrugrits. But a distant semblance of marriage between him and the Russian entity named Dingra consists in the fact that he, by absorbing individual Russian souls, more precisely - Shelties, during their human sleep, plunges them into the womb of Dingra, where they transform, being maimed and spiritually embodied. The results of this are perceived by us as a psychic transformation of those of our compatriots who have become active builders of the citadel.

In addition to Rarughs and Igv, there are other inhabitants in Drukkarg: those whose life and activities in Russian Enrof were firmly linked to great-power construction, who wielded great power and influenced the fates of millions of souls. Here they are held as prisoners and slaves, tirelessly building the citadel of Igv. Nothing will free them except the death of the Jrugrs and the destruction of Drukkaгg. Here are, for example, from the very beginning of their posthumous existence, Ivan III and almost all other monarchs, military leaders, and active builders of statehood. Exceptions? Yes, there are exceptions. On the one hand, these are tyrants: before entering Drukkaгg, they have to atone for their personal karma for centuries in deep suffering. Some of them have already passed through these circles and are now here, for example, Ivan the Terrible. Others, like Paul I or Arakcheev, are only just rising from the depths of magma. But there are other exceptions, insignificant in number: those who, being monarchs, created a counterbalance to their personal state karma even during their lifetime, created it with fervent faith, high mercy, and kindness, or even with suffering. Let us recall Vladimir the Holy, Vladimir Monomakh, Alexander Nevsky, and Fedor Ioannovich. Let us recall those for whom power, barely taken into their hands, became a source of only suffering, loss, and even death: Fedor Godunov, Ivan Antonovich. Many will be surprised by such a statement, but Nicholas II was spared from Drukkaгg by the tragedy he experienced in Yekaterinburg. A very special significance is attached to one of the most colossal figures of Russian meta-history - Alexander I. A separate chapter in this book is devoted to him.

There are about three hundred such prisoners in Drukkarg. These are humanoid beings of enormous size, reminiscent of the figures of ancient Titans. But there is nothing glowing about their appearance. On the contrary, their faces seem to be charred by a deep fire, and their bodies are clad in coarse, dark-crimson fabrics. They are bound together, and their labor is akin to laying stones, constructing new and new tiers of the citadel. They have short periods of sleep. Their food is infrared vegetation. They are ruled by fear of the witzraor: in case of disobedience or rebellion, he can drop them, like the igv, to the Pit of Shadanakar. The history of Drukkarg already knows such cases. Similarly to Drukkarg, such titan prisoners are held in Mudgabre Karl V, Napoleon, almost all monarchs, commanders, and statesmen of Northwest Europe and North America. In Yuna, Grigory VII, Loyola, and most popes work as stonemasons. Torquemada, having spent many centuries in Biasca and Propulka, has only been raised to the lower purgatories. And in a special, completely inaccessible cell, the rulers of Drukkarg hold those of the brethren synclite who were taken prisoner during the battles between the forces of the strasta and the forces of the Light. No one can destroy them - neither the witzraors nor the igv. They seem to languish in indefinite imprisonment, awaiting the inevitable - sooner or later - demise of this fortress of anti-humanity.

## Book V. Structure of Shadanakar. Elementals

### Chapter 1. Demonic Elementals

Among the diverse and varied layers that make up Shadanakar, there are four sakualas associated with what we call the elements of Nature. How are they connected? Through what?

Here we touch upon a thesis that is difficult to explain. The point is that the meaning and significance of a certain zone of the three-dimensional world, encompassing, let's say, the snowy peaks of mountains, is by no means exhausted by what is grasped by our five senses, that is, by these peaks made of gneiss, granite, and other rocks covered with firn and glaciers. This three-dimensional zone turns out to be, in addition to being a hemisphere, related to another zone, conventionally speaking - a hemisphere, but possessing a different number of spatial coordinates.
The snowy ridges, lifeless, shelterless, and barren in their dead splendor, are only one of the two hemispheres or two layers of a closely related system. The other hemisphere or, more precisely, its layer is one-dimensional. This layer represents a country of incarnate spirits of amazing greatness, similar to the kings of the snowy peaks. It is called Orliontana. It is the shining of Orliontana through the crust of the three-dimensional substance that creates the impression of regal calmness, power, and radiance that the snowy ridges evoke in everyone who is even slightly capable of receiving inspiration from the forces of the transphysical world through beauty. Orliontana, seen by spiritual vision, is the mountain peaks in spiritual glory. The peaks visible to our physical eyes are nothing more than the fruits of the mighty creative existence of these beings - the Elementals of Orliontana, spanning millions of years. When the human soul, carrying within itself the consequences of long periods of unbelief, withdraws to Olirne among its translucent mountains, it is precisely the insight into the layer of Orliontana that helps to eliminate the last traces of blind closure and rigidity in the spiritual being and brings the human soul closer to understanding the multi-layered and spiritual grandeur of the Universe.

However, in contrast to Orlyontan, most layers of elementals are local, meaning that their space does not have cosmic extension. More precisely, they are devoid even of the extension up to the boundaries of the solar system, which the worlds of shrastras possess. Therefore, in most of these layers, there is no sky. The layers of elementals themselves are similar to oases, and between them is desert. They are demarcated from each other, like shrastras, by differences in numerical time coordinates.

Elementals are called those monads that primarily undergo their path of formation in Shadanakar through the realms of Nature. It should not be forgotten that humanity is also an aspect of the peculiar realm of Nature. Elemental, namely elemental forces boiling within it, without which its existence is unthinkable, express, although not exhaust, this aspect. Therefore, it is not surprising that there are also elementals that are not connected with nature in the commonly accepted sense of the word but with humanity, with its elemental, natural aspect.

Among elementals, there are many spiritual entities of the bright nature, demonic, as well as such intermediate groups whose essence was temporarily clouded in the course of their development. But they are all united by one thing: their path is so closely connected with the realms of Nature as with no one else. This does not mean, however, that a monad of any elemental cannot incarnate in the flesh of a human, demon, or angel on any segment of its path. It can perfectly well. Just as some human monads began to create a form for themselves from denser material substances in time immemorial, not in human layers, but in the sakwal of elementals or in the sakwal of angels. But for them, this was a short-lived comparative stage. The incarnations of certain elementals in human or any other forms are equally short-lived.

If we exclude from the circle those we are talking about, the animal kingdom, as well as the world of trees, then it should be considered that the most dense form, the true embodiment of the elements, takes shape in those sakualas to which their name is assigned. The natural elements in Enroth are water, air, earth, plant life, mineral layers of magma, and finally, the "life force," arungvilita-prana, the presence of which is an essential condition for any organic life in Enroth. All of this, for the most part, is not the flesh of the elements, but rather an external concentric circle of their environment, penetrated, moved, and transformed by them - the arena and material of their creativity, their joy and anger, their struggle, play, and love. The flesh of the elements themselves is mostly of a flowing nature, with boundaries that are not constant and capable of interpenetration. However, this is not the case with all elements, and in each such case, it will be specified. I start with the demonic elements only because it is precisely this demonism that connects them to the layers of infra-physics, the panorama of which we, thank God, are going to leave behind. Then, having said a few words about the intermediate group, we can easily put a stop to the description of the sad or gloomy layers and complete the review of the brahamatura, after characterizing the bright elemental layers, the highest worlds, spiritually shining in their unattainable height, in the holy of holies of Shadanakar.

There is an area of wild and frightening magma poetical beings that are subject to enlightenment almost later than any other: Shartamahum. This area should be understood as a zone of the embodiment of beings whose shells between incarnations are in the infrairon ocean of Fukabirna, without experiencing the suffering that becomes the lot of fallen human souls there. The physical magma, as I said, is the outer circle of their environment during periods of their incarnation in Shartamahum, the arena and material of their creativity, their anger, and struggle. During volcanic activity, earthquakes, and geological catastrophes, the Shartamahum poetic beings erupt from the underground depths of that layer, as if to its surface; thereby they carry lava flows up from under the ground in Enrofe, bringing only death to living beings. But this is only an indirect, almost accidental result of their activity. They have nothing to do with living beings in Enrofe, they simply do not perceive them, and if they did, they would not understand them. The direct meaning of their activity should be sought in a completely different plane, and it will become clearer to us if we imagine what would happen to the earth if the activity of Shartamahum ceased millions of years ago. Subjectively, the activity of these poetic beings is only rebellious debauchery, wild frenzy, knowing no control and providing them with pleasure precisely by the awareness of their power and impunity. Objectively, however, this frenzy causes changes in the face of the earth in Enrofe, processes of mountain formation, a change in the dominant regimes - marine and continental, corresponding to the evolution of the plant and animal kingdoms, and ultimately the creation of prerequisites for the appearance of man. The malicious and violent actions of demonic poetic beings are partially turned by Providential forces for good, extracting from them some positive result.

But there are also poetic beings whose activity has not yet yielded a positive result. For example, the poetic beings of swamps, bogs, and tropical thickets. The layer of their stay, called Gannix, is similar to underwater darkness. Between incarnations in Gannix, their souls are in the darkest of the worlds of the earth's core - in Ytreche. And as for Gannix, haven't many peoples felt its existence at the dawn of their history, until other spiritual aspirations overshadowed and extinguished this experience in them? And don't some still feel the existence of Gannix today? Tales about different, or rather faceless, beings who assume different forms are associated with this world. These treacherous creatures lure humans into deadly places. It is hidden not only in the three-dimensional zones of swamps and marshes, but also in the icy plains of the Siberian taiga, in the chary and nemerecha forests of central Russia. Along with the desert stihia and the black, swirling stihia of Ganniks, they are responsible for the tragic demise of Australian culture.

No less hostile to humans and all living things are the poetry of the sand masses, whose layer of manifestation is called Svix and resembles a desert in a state of sandstorm. Between manifestations in this layer, the deserts of Shiim-big are located, where they intensify the torment of human souls passing through this infra-physical tunnel, tormenting them in the form of whirlwinds sucking onto them. The desert at rest, when the poetry of Svix is tired or immersed in forgetfulness, presents to human eyes such majestic expanses, such peaceful and clean distances, and the sky looms over it with such obvious divinity that there are probably no areas in Enroth more conducive to contemplating the One. It is easy to understand why clear monotheism arose and established itself in countries with great deserts. But the desert is dual. And traces of the sandstorms that obscure the face of the sky, the traces of the poetry of Svix that darken the face of the One, can be seen even on the pages of such monuments of world revelation as the Bible and the Quran.

In the impenetrable worlds of the earth's core, there are other poetry of souls between incarnations: grim, angular, gloomy, and greedy poetry of the deep sea. Their realm of embodiment, Nugurt, will not await enlightenment very soon, only at the end of the second zone. But if the forces of Shartamahum break out to the surface during the hours of eruption, then the emanations of Nugurt rise, on the contrary, from the depths, through the light-pierced world of beautiful poetry of the upper layers of the sea. In the open ocean, the emanations of Nugurt are stronger, because there the thickness of the deep dark layers is thicker than in shallow sea basins. For us, this radiation is not physically dangerous, but its devastating, burdening effect falls under the spiritual composition of our being. Many sailors could have traced this on themselves if their thoughts were armed with trans-physical analysis.

And there is another world of demonic poetry, standing as if alone, because it is not associated with the elements of nature, but with the element of humanity. This layer is called Duggur, and it is necessary to remember this name, because it is there that the demons of the great cities of Enroth reign, highly dangerous to our spiritual being.

Like Agra and Bustvich, in structural terms Duggur represents an oceanic sphere of dark vapors, uninhabited by anyone, and rare islands that are spatially linked to the giant cities of the three-dimensional world. The landscape is sharply urban, even more so than in the Shrastras, because there are no mountains, no lava seas, no vegetation, but also no darkness or crimson glow. The entire spectrum of our world exists there, with predominance of muted tones of blue, gray, and blue-moon. From Duggur, even the sky is visible, but of all celestial bodies, only the Moon, because its space fades away soon beyond the lunar perimeter. However, even the Moon there has a completely different appearance than what we are accustomed to because the inhabitants of Duggur can only see the layer where Voglea - the great lunar demon - resides. In the Russian language, there is no corresponding feminine word, but when speaking of worlds like Duggur, the need for such a word becomes necessary. And although the word "demoness" is unfamiliar and unmusical, I will have to use it.

The demonesses of the great cities of our layer are burdened in Duggur with colossal materiality. These embodiments are partly humanoid, but only to the extent that immense bodies almost incapable of movement can resemble a human. In each of the cities of Duggur, there is only one such demoness, while the population of the cities consists of small demons of both sexes, barely distinguishable from humans in terms of their size and shape. They swarm around their mistress like bees around the queen, but their goal is only partly to help her, and the main thing is pleasure, while her sense and purpose are not the continuation of the species (which continues without her), but the satisfaction of the lust of her subjects. Grandiose dwellings are created for the demonesses; in each of the cities of Duggur, there is only one such dwelling in the form of a truncated pyramid, resembling a monstrous altar. Duggur is not only grandiose, but also majestic and luxurious in its own way. As in the Shrastras, there is an equivalent of human technology there, although its level can be compared to that of technology in our ancient great cities.

The organization of society is developing very slowly, gradually beginning to show some signs of what in human language is called self-government. But the social-economic basis remains slavery, and those who have fallen here from humanity or from some other worlds of other planes become the slaves. The position of the minor demons of Duggur is reminiscent of the position of the patricians and equestrians in Ancient Rome. It cannot be said that they are particularly cruel, but they are extremely sensual, as no other being in Enroth is. The basis of the rule of the great demonesses here could not be shaken by any rebellion, because it is based not on fear, but on the lust that millions of subjects feel for them, and on the pleasure that is given to them as a reward for their obedience and love.

The demonesses of Duggur give themselves physically to entire crowds at once, and in their abodes, half-palaces and half-dumps, there is a continuous, almost incomprehensible orgy in honor of the demonic queen of the Moon, the same one whose influence we humans sometimes feel in city moonlit nights: it is mixed with the alluringly exalted and pure influence of the bright Tanit, arousing in the human being a yearning for sexual pleasures that do not exist in Enroth. These forms exist in Duggur. In Duggur, an almost inexhaustible scale of these forms has been developed, as diverse as nowhere else in Shadanakar. The influence of Tanit does not reach here at all, and they have no notion of sunlight, everything is immersed either in gray darkness or in pale bluish-purple flashes of moonlight, and nothing hinders the frenzy of passions caused by the lunar demoness Voglea. From the continuous orgies in the palaces-altars of Duggur, clouds of vapor rise to her, and she drinks them, but nothing can satisfy the countless inhabitants of these cities, because they are tormented by an even deeper, little understood kind of sensuality - mystical sensuality, which draws them towards something unattainable even for them: the Great Harlot. She is their deity, their longing and dream. Their highest cult is dedicated to her. On her feast days, the ruling demonesses give themselves to the slaves. But this mystical sensuality can only be satisfied in Digma, in the abode of Gagthung, and only the chosen ones are worthy of it.

The replenishment of the life force of the countless population of Duggur is carried out at the expense of our layer: the emission of human and partly animal lust, the so-called eifos, which slowly and viscously flows along the streets of Duggur in whitish streams, and they absorb it. Such food corresponds to their own being: lust is the meaning, goal, content, and pathos of their life. The sharpness of the pleasures they experience is many times stronger than we are capable of. They move in a circle of reincarnations, and for them, it is truly an inescapable circle: every time between incarnations, their souls plunge into Bustvich, taking on the form of human-worms and devouring living people in this eternally decaying world. And yet, the pleasure delivered by lust, even the insatiable mystical sensuality to the Great Whore, is so great in their eyes that they are willing to pay for their stay in Bustvich with their frenzy and orgies in Duggur.

The only luminary in Duggur, its sun, is the Moon: therefore, most of the time, this layer is plunged into deep darkness. Then artificial lighting comes into play - long chains of murky blue and purplish lanterns - they stretch in endless garlands along lush, massive buildings. Curved lines dominate in architecture, but this does not free its forms from heaviness. The interior and exterior decoration of the buildings is gaudy and coarse, but it amazes with its wealth, its striking splendor. Architects, artists, even scientists, not to mention workers, belong to the slave class. The main demonic population of Duggur is as intellectually and artistically impotent as it is gifted with lust.

For the human soul, a breakdown in Duggur poses a serious danger. The breakdown occurs when throughout life in Enroth, the soul has been tormented and weakened by the lust for the otherworldly - that very mystical lust that small demons of Duggur feel towards the Great Harlot. Even staying in Bustwich cannot restore the necessary balance between the burdened etheric body and the environment for such a soul. The soul with its clothing falls into Rafag, where a new breakdown awaits it: into that very world which it vaguely dreamed of on earth. There, in Duggur, a Karrokh is put on it - a dense material body, similar to the physical one, but created from the materiality of the demonic worlds that is born of the dark hierarchies of metamorphosis and Gagtung. Saving the soul from slavery in Duggur by the power of Light encounters exceptional difficulties. However, there is one act that depends on the human soul itself, which can open the way to salvation for it: suicide. Sinful in Enroth, where materiality is created by Providence forces and prepared for enlightenment, suicide in the demonic layers is justified because it leads to the destruction of the Karrokh and the liberation of the soul. But if this act is not committed, and the bright forces of assistance are defeated, the soul after death in Duggur ends up in Bustwich again, then again in Duggur - no longer as a slave, but as privileged. Shelt gradually becomes demonized, gets stuck in the wheel of incarnations from Duggur to Bustwich and back, and it may happen that the monad eventually refuses it. Then he falls into Sufeth, the cemetery of Shadanakar, and dies there forever, and the monad leaves our Bramfatura to start its path anew somewhere at the other end of the Universe. Of those few souls that perished forever in Sufeth, most were victims of Duggur.

The description of Duggur can be finished with a small stroke. In Duggur-Petersburg, just like in Drukkarg and in Heavenly Russia, there is a double - or rather, a triple - of the huge statue of the Horseman. But here, this Horseman rushes not on a rarugga, like in the capital of Russian anti-humanism, and certainly not on a celestial white horse, like in heavenly Petersburg. Here, it is the sculpture of the founder of this infernal city, with a violently burning and smoking torch in his outstretched hand. The difference in this figure is also that he rushes not on a horse, but on a gigantic snake. Perhaps now the reader of this book will understand what Alexander Blok was talking about and whom he was referring to in verses filled with true insight:

The silent evenings will descend,
The serpent will coil above the homes.
In Peter's outstretched hand,
The torch flames will dance and roam.

The threads of lamps will ignite,
The storefronts and sidewalks will shine.
In the flicker of dimming squares,
Pairs will wander and intertwine.

With cloaks, darkness will conceal,
The gaze will drown in an alluring stare.
Let innocence pray from the corner,
Longing for mercy and a spare.

There, on the rock, the jolly king
Swung a foul-smelling censer in the air,
And the city's filth covered him like a gown,
As the tempting lantern's glow did flare.

Everyone, run to the call! Go hunting!
To the crossroads of moonlit streets!
The city is full of voices,
Male - clamorous, female - melodious beats.

He will guard his city,
And, ablaze before the dawn,
In his outstretched hand, a sword will gleam,
Above the fading capital, withdrawn.

What is in the hand of the founder Duggur sooner or later, instead of a torch, a sword of punishment, a sword of karma, becomes clear. And every human soul that has visited this dark lunar city cannot help but remember this, even if only vaguely. What is not entirely clear is to what extent Block himself understood the relationship between Duggur and our world. I will try to express some observations on this in the chapters of the book that are devoted to the problem of the meta-historical meaning of artistic genius.

In some combination with Duggur, there are layers of stichials belonging not to the demonic, but to the intermediate group. Their monads, like those of other stichials of the bright nature, are in one of the beautiful worlds of High Obligation, in Flauros. But because their nature is clouded in the course of their development, their path of incarnation leads to the layers of Nibruks, Maniku, Kattara, and Ron, and the purgatories and suffering are replaced for them by Duggur, where they lead their days in slavery.

Posthumously ascending brings them first to Shalem - for them it is similar to our Olirna, and then, through Fayr and Usnorm, to Flauros, where they are reunited with their monads.

Nibruks are creatures that are, as it were, intermediate between small demons of Duggur and what the ancient Romans called "genii loci". No human settlement can do without nibruks. I am still unclear on how and why these creatures are interested in the physical aspect of human love, especially in our birth. Perhaps some emanations of the human soul in states characteristic of infancy and early childhood have some relation to the replenishment of nibruks with their life forces. In any case, their interest is not in doubt. They take care of things in their own way, helping to bring men and women in our layer closer together, noisily rejoicing in our children, bustling around them, even trying to protect them from invisible dangers. But they are capricious, impulsive, and vengeful. They can't always be trusted.

And let the wise men of our age, who have imprisoned themselves in a materialistic cell, mock the superstitions of savages from their ignorance, only in tales of house spirits, penates, and larvae, of kind and mischievous little spirits of the home hearth, lies deep truth. Ancient paganism knew it much better than us, better than Jews and Muslims, better than Christians, who denigrated these harmless beings with slanders and myths. Gossip about house spirits surprises with its injustice. Such fairy tales are born only of one spirit - the same one that is inherent in the fanatics of monotheism, bigots and dry moralists, declaring everything that does not belong to their canon unclean. The ancients who saw these creatures as faithful friends - the lares and penates - were more objective. The realm of these small spirits, nestled around human dwellings, is called Maniku. The landscapes of this world resemble a room and are not devoid of comfort. But outside there is darkness and cold, and God forbid these creatures are expelled from their warm shelters. And their incarnations are not like those of most spirits: there is nothing flowing and iridescent in them, on the contrary, like the Nibruks, like the inhabitants of Duggur, they have a dense, sharply defined body, one might say - a torso. They are miniature, cheerful and mischievous, and some are actively kind. They are a kind of philanthropists who love to do small favors for people so that no one knows. However, others allow themselves more or less harmless jokes with people. In general, they treat us selectively, but they try to keep and protect the house as best they can. Because in the event of its destruction, their shelters in the Maniku layer are also destroyed, and homeless children in most cases perish. Only a few manage to reach another refuge. About Kattaram, the realm of spirits of the mineral kingdom, connected with the upper part of the earth's crust, I can hardly say anything: I have no corresponding personal experience, and my invisible friends have told me only a few words about this world. I only know that the landscape of Kattaram is underground voids among self-luminous metaminerals, beautiful with fairy-tale beauty, but to us it still seems lifeless. The population of Kattaram is diverse (remember "The Mistress of the Copper Mountain" on the one hand, trolls on the other), and communication with these spirits can be fraught with, although not always, supernatural dangers. Less familiar to me is Ron: its landscape is similar to Kattaram's, but enriched by the reflection of the sky - only by reflection. This is a region of mountainous elementals, a colorful world of creatures often at war with each other.

The last, or rather, the highest of the layers of this Sakuala should be considered Shalem - a peculiar Olympos for the elementaley of the four previous layers. Its landscape is partly comparable to colossal oaks in the midst of the desert. Blue-green tones predominate in the centers of the landscape, while yellowish and gray tones prevail at the edges. Here, the elementaley become quite bright and regal, and here they are not awaited by death, but by transformation leading to Fair and Usnorm, which they buy at the cost of almost complete physical immobility. Immobility is compensated by the depth and concentrated penetrating power of spiritual contemplation in which they are immersed. Some peoples of our world, sensing the existence of these beings, understood them as spirits of individual mountains, waterfalls, springs, and places. In reality, they are not spirits, but fully incarnated beings, and the inseparable connection between them and the places of Enroth is only apparent. It is conditioned by their immobility, which the ancients interpreted according to the level of their understanding of such truths. The truth is that if the source dries up, the waterfall will be blocked, the mountain will be destroyed by an earthquake, the elementaley of Shalem will remain immovable in their places until their inner work on their own being leads them to the moment of transformation.

### Chapter 2. The Bright Elementals

I'm tired of listing new and new layers and introducing new and new names. Now there are only a few left ahead, though - the review of the structure of Shadanakar is coming to an end, but I would like to make it clear that I am not introducing all these names for fun or whim. No matter how unfamiliar they may sound now and no matter how much they may seem to the overwhelming majority as idle play of imagination, there will come times when every high school student will know these names as firmly as he now knows the names of Latin American republics or provinces of China. If I thought otherwise, I would never have dared to attract readers' attention to these names and titles. What is the point of composing the "geography" and "geology" of some planet from the Aldebaran system if no one will ever get there, and even our descendants may only see it as a weak star? Who needs such a invention? But the metageography of Shadanakar is needed by units now, it will soon be needed by hundreds, and someday, probably, by millions. After all, ordinary geography was needed only by a few a mere two hundred years ago, in the days of Madame Prostakova.

How lucky I am that our descent into the demonic worlds has ended and that before us are the layers of beautiful beings, undoubtedly favorable for humans. But describing the bright, especially otherworldly, is always much more difficult than the dark or monstrous. I am afraid that I will not escape the fate of most of those who write: finding colors and words for images of gloomy and mournful things, suffering from a lack of pictorial means when it comes to celestial radiance.

It is precisely shining and glittering in the elevated Flaurós that the monads of the bright stíkhiales extend their shelters from there, like rays, into the lower realms, in order to concentrate enlightened matter around themselves: these are their souls, clothed in astral coverings. During the intervals between incarnations, these souls remain there. However, when incarnating in the realms of the bright stíkhiales, they, in turn, concentrate around themselves the materiality of a denser substance: the etheric. It is precisely these worlds that are enumerated in this chapter. None of the bright stíkhiales, except for Stíkhial Arashampha, knows reproduction, just as they do not know incarnation in Enrof. Each of them independently clothes itself in the fabrics of the four-dimensional world: this is the incarnation that does not require reproduction. And after a chain of incarnations, each stíkhial, instead of experiencing yet another death, undergoes a transformation leading to Faihr and Usnorm.

They perceive Enrof and, in particular, humans, with a sense of touch and one of the senses that we do not possess. And, of course, a person is not indifferent to them: their attitude towards each of us is determined by our attitude towards Nature. And as for the fact that the elements of Enrof are best understood as an external, concentric circle of their habitat, I have already mentioned that. It seems that only poetry and music have been able to express this connection between stíkhiales and elements, this wonderful life of theirs in joy, play, love, and happiness. It is enough to recall Wagner's ingenious pages - the so-called "Rustling of the Forest," where not the wind, but the stíkhiales themselves embrace each other and the beautiful earth with this wind over the sea of trees and blooming meadows.

German fairy tales about elves are not really fairy tales: there is a layer of habitation of good-natured, charming little creatures resembling elves. It can indeed be called the Land of Elves.

The upper thin layer of the earth's crust, where the roots and seeds of plants are hidden, has its counterpart in the transphysical worlds - the wonderful land of Darainnu, the realm of benevolent spirits who care for the roots and seeds. Its landscape may seem magical: seeds and roots glow softly in shades of blue, silver, and green; a gentle aura flickers around each grain. The inhabitants of Darainnu are tiny creatures resembling white caps; each one has another smaller cap on top, like a head, and a pair of delicate and nimble limbs - somewhere between hands and wings. They quietly glide through the air, rustling the folds of their caps - this is their speech, their way of communicating with each other - and they prophesy over the seeds and roots, like over cradles. They are familiar with the mysterious processes by which a small seed grows into a large tree with all the complexity of its forms. If it were not for their help, dark forces would have gained access to these cradles and long ago turned the earth's surface into impenetrable thickets of nightmarish forms - vampiric, predatory, and grotesque equivalents of vegetation.

If you delve into the soil of Darainnu, you will eventually reach Rona or Kattarama. The lower tier of forests - mosses, grasses, shrubs, everything we call undergrowth - corresponds to a layer called Murohamma, and the dwelling place of the celestial trees is called Arashamf.

No, these are not dryads. Perhaps there were creatures similar to those called by the ancient Greeks, but I don't know them. The elemental of Murohamma and Arashamfa do not resemble humans in any way, nor any creature of our layer. The souls of individual trees exist in the zatoms, they are intelligent, highly beautiful and wise there. The brothers of the synclites communicate with them fully: this is a mutual exchange of ideas, feelings, life experiences.

But in Arashamfa, they are clothed in etheric bodies and immersed in a semi-dream state. The trees of Enrofa are their physical bodies. Each elemental of Arashamfa has gone through many incarnations; the total number of years of existence in Enrofa can be calculated for many of them with huge numbers approaching a million.

The landscape of Arashamfa resembles green, gently swaying tongues of fragrant, not hot flames. Some of them are benefactors, like the righteous, and are kindly disposed towards us. They are patient, calm and humble. Sometimes something solemn happens between them: they bend towards each other, all in one direction. The entire etheric forest turns into quiet bending and straightening, interflowing flames; they raise a kind of hymn of praise together. Sometimes the layer of Murohamma participates in this: it is the same green space, but denser, darker, warmer and even more affectionate.

Everyone can easily remember how on a summer morning or a spring noon, quiet winds kiss the earth. They kiss the earth with its grasses, fields and roads, trees, the surface of rivers and lakes, people and animals. These elementals of the layer called Vayita rejoice in life. They rejoice in us and in plants, waters and the Sun, they rejoice in cool, hot, soft, hard, illuminated or semi-dark earth, stroke it and caress it.

If we were able to see Vayita with our own eyes, it would seem to us that we are immersed in green, fragrant, playing waves, completely transparent, cool-warm, and most importantly - alive, intelligent and rejoicing in us.

When you immerse your face in the grass of a flowering meadow on a hot day and your head is spinning from the honey scent, the breath of the heated earth and leaves, and barely audible fluctuations of light and heat pass over the meadows - these are the elementals of Vayita playing and celebrating together with the children of Faltora - the area of elementals of meadows and fields. We don't have a single murky thought left in us - it may seem that this is the lost paradise, the dust of "worldly care" is blown away from the soul by pure breaths, and besides the all-consuming love for nature, we are unable to experience anything.

Through the running waters of peaceful rivers shines a world of truly indescribable beauty. There is a special hierarchy - I have long been accustomed to calling it the souls of rivers, although now I understand that this expression is not accurate. Each river has such a "soul", unique and incomparable. We see the outer layer of its eternal flesh, like the streams of the river; its true soul is in Heavenly Russia or in another heavenly country if it flows through the lands of another culture, Enroth. But its inner layer of flesh, ethereal, which it permeates incomparably more vividly and where it manifests almost with complete awareness, is in a world adjacent to us called Liurno. The bliss of its life lies in the fact that it continuously gives both streams of its flowing flesh to a larger river, and that river to the sea, but the flesh does not diminish, flowing and flowing from source to mouth.

It is impossible to find words to express the charm of these beings, so joyful, laughing, lovely, pure and peaceful, that no human tenderness can compare with theirs, except perhaps the tenderness of the brightest and most loving daughters of humans. And if we are fortunate enough to perceive Liurna with body and soul, plunging the body into the streams of the river, the ethereal body into the streams of Liurna, and the soul into its soul, shining in the gloom, we will come ashore with a heart so pure, enlightened, and joyful that a human could possess before the fall.

By its impact on the human soul, Vlanmim is somewhat similar to Liurna - the realm of upper sea stichials. The landscape of this world is a bright blue, rhythmically undulating ocean, a delicately bright and enchanting azure that does not exist in Enrof, and its waves bloom not with foam, but with milky-white lace spheres resembling large flowers. These flowers bloom and melt before our eyes, blooming and melting again. The stichials of Liurna are of a feminine nature, while Vlanmim is masculine, but this has nothing to do with reproduction, although the connection between the river and the sea is an expression of the love of the stichials of these two worlds for each other. Vlanmim is also capable of making us wiser and purer, but it is open to the influence of the gloomy stichials of the sea depths - Nughurta, and therefore it is more severe. Its impact is noticeable on the emotional disposition and even the physical appearance of people who come into contact with it on a daily basis, even if only subconsciously: fishermen and, to some extent, sailors. However, the latter are too marked by the imprint of other, not bright stichials: the owners of Nughurta on the one hand, and the stichials of the major port cities of Nibrusk and Duggura on the other. The fishermen have acquired from the emanations of Vlanmim a characteristic that sets them apart from the rest of the people: a combination of purity, courage, and rough, somewhat cruel strength with the integrity of a child's soul.

Everywhere above the land and seas stretches Zunguf - the realm of aerial moisture stichials that create clouds, rain, dew, and fog. Zunguf is not separated by a definite border from Irudrana - the realm of stichials whose activity is manifested in Enrof in thunderstorms, partly hurricanes; both of these layers blend into each other, as do their creatures. That same Transmyth that shimmered in the ancient myths of the peoples, evoking in their creative imagination titanic images of thunderers: Indra, Perun, Thor. Oh, if only the ancients, imbuing these images, as with everything human, with human traits, could know how infinitely distant these beings are from the slightest resemblance to humans! And when streams of rain pour down on the earth and the turbulent, cheerful children of Zunguf rejoice, lying on the ground and on the surface of the water, then jumping up into the air, into the bubbling water element - higher, into Irudrana, there rage battles of creatures who resemble Thor and Indra in nothing but their joyful militancy: for them, a storm is creativity, and a hurricane is the fullness of their lives.

If light frost falls softly or trees and buildings stand whitened with hoarfrost, then the lively, playful, almost ecstatic joy that we experience testifies to the proximity of the wonderful poetic land of Nivenna. White expanses, immaculate in their own way, with indescribable purity, that is what Nivenna is, the land of poetic hoarfrost and fresh snow cover. Frolicking in an otherworldly glee reminiscent of the merriment of elves, they cover their beloved land with their fairy veil.

Why does such a joy of life permeate us when myriad silent white stars gently fall around us? And why, when we see forests or city parks whitened with hoarfrost, do we experience a feeling that combines solemnity and lightness, a surge of vitality and admiration, reverence and childlike delight? And those of us who have preserved in our souls the eternal childlike element are particularly fond of the poetic land of Nivenna; they greet it and try to play with it: even the excitement, the boyish fervor, the quick rush of blood in the veins of boys during snowball fights or sledding down hills is pleasant to them.

Nivenna is adjacent to the harsh and gloomy Akhash, a layer of arctic and antarctic hoarfrost associated with the polar regions of our planet. Akhash has cosmic vastness, and the Milky Way is visible from it. At certain times of the year, the boundaries of both polar regions move towards the tropics.

The unrestrained soul of these creatures, with its inclination to transition from crystal-clear contemplation to frenzy, with its impulses to build entire worlds out of transphysical ice, with its love to gaze, eye to eye, into the bottomless abysses of metagalaxy, has put a striking imprint on the nature of the polar basins perceived by all of us. When the Earth's revolution around the Sun causes the onset of winter in the northern hemisphere and makes the inhabited areas of the continents accessible to the poetic beings of Akhash, they invade, carrying physical masses of arctic air with them, warring with blizzards and snowstorms across fields and taiga, rejoicing in the heights of anticyclones. They do not see Enroth as we do. They do not perceive humans through sight either. But among them, there are those who are more predatory and emotionally cold, like Andersen's Snow Queen; they are dangerous to humans. And there are others who catch the atmosphere of the soul of those of us who are related to them by courage, daring, and fearlessness. They can love such people with a strange, incomparable love. They cradle him on their snowy knees, opening paths for him into the depths of their lands, showing him the terrifying splendor of the physical coverings of their kingdom, and, not proportioning their grandeur to our bodily insignificance, they are ready to wrap him in a white shroud under the songs of the blizzard.

And just as the space of Ahasha has cosmic extent, so do the two last layers of elementals: Diramn, linked to the stratospheric air ocean of the low-temperature zone belt, and Siana, a world shining to inner sight through the high-temperature zones that encompass our planet at great height. However, the elementals dwelling there are so vast and so alien to our emotional makeup that understanding their essence is extremely difficult. They are bright, but with a scorching, threatening light. Only a human spirit that has risen to an exceptional height can gain access to their realm.

Such is the sakuala of the Lesser Elementals. Lesser, of course, not in comparison to humans - many of them are much more powerful than an individual human - but in comparison to the sakuala of others, to the ascending ladder of the Supreme Elementals, to the ranks of genuine planetary deities. They are the rulers. The Lesser Elementals quiver joyfully at their breath. Most of them are beautiful, high-benevolent beings of unspeakable greatness. But it is almost impossible to speak of the landscapes of these layers, just as it is impossible to speak of the form of these great beings: each of them is present simultaneously in many points of its layer.

"The King of the Blessing Wings", Vayum, the embodied spirit of the aerial ocean, extends his dominion from the furthest reaches of the atmosphere to the deepest abysses. He and his brother, the "King of the Revitalizing Waters" Ea (also known as Vlarol), were worshipped by the Greeks as Poseidon and by the Romans as Neptune, but the Babylonians, who revered him as the guardian and master of the world's waters, understood the goodness and cosmic nature of his being the most deeply, and paid homage to him with a magnificent cult. Both spirits stand eternal guard at the sources of life throughout the earth, not only in Enroth, but in many other sakualas. They are as ancient as water and air, and as sinless as they are.

Even more ancient than these two brothers is the third, Povurn, the "King of the Burning Body", for the deepest reality is hidden in the beliefs of Pluto and the ancient Yamu. This frightening lord of the subterranean magma is not a servant of Gatung, but his transformation seems to be later than all others, at the end of the second zone.

There is also a fourth great brother, the youngest: Zaranda, embodied in his immaterial layer as the "King of all animal kingdoms". The tragic history of the animal kingdom in Enroth has left a deep, truly global mark on his face. And no matter how historians explain the symbolism of the Egyptian sphinx, the meta-story will always see in it the emblem of one who combines the nature of the Great Beast with wisdom beyond human.

There are seven Supreme elementals. Two divine sisters divide the remaining spheres of power between them: Estira, the "Queen of the Eternal Garden", the lady of the plant kingdoms of Shadankar, and Lilith, the "All-People Aphrodite" of all humanity.

The significance of Lilith in our existence is immeasurably great. Like all Supreme Elementals, the world in which she resides is incomparable to any of our forms and indescribable, and her own form is immeasurable. Her immaterial body is present in many places of her layer, and only in isolated cases does she take on a form that can be perceived by human spiritual vision. Although I do not know the mechanism of this process, I know that without the participation of Lilith, the formation of any body in worlds of dense materiality is impossible, with the exception of animals whose forms are formed by Zaraanda. In all other kingdoms, this activity is carried out by Lilith: she forms the chain of generations both in Enroth's humanity, and among demons, and in demonic worlds - among raruggs and igvs, and among the inhabitants of Duggur. Every dense material body created with her participation in the dark worlds is a Karrokh. That is why she fully deserves the name of our, and not only our, flesh's creator. Therefore, the sphere of sexual feelings is inseparably linked to her being and influence on humans. Whether she herself or her carossi, this principle always stands above any act of human copulation, and as long as the fetus is being carried in the womb, she is always present. Once, in the deepest antiquity, this Stygial became the spouse of the First Angel - the greatest Spirit who became the Logos of Shadanakar. It was during the time of the creation of angelic layers, and Lilith became the primordial mother of this first humanity. But Gagtungur managed to penetrate the world of Lilith, and her most delicate material body absorbed a certain demonic element. It was a catastrophe. Since then, all chains of generations formed by her, whether in the worlds of titans, demons or humans, absorb something of this element. Jewish mysticism knows the term "aitz ha-ra" - the seed of the devil in man. Let us use it to denote this cursed seed both in humans and in Lilith herself, carrying it within her to this day, and in her carossi.

Only Lilith possesses the monad and fullness of consciousness: her local manifestations, including the Dingra of Russia, despite their power and age-old stability, only have an equivalent consciousness and lack the monad. We owe these sculptors of the physical flesh of nations, among other things, for the often explicit and sometimes almost imperceptible similarities, visible physical kinship features that are characteristic of the mass of individual appearances of any people. It is known that in ancient times, in Cyprus, the cult of the goddess of love at one time split into two opposites: the elevated cult of Urania Aphrodite, spiritual, creative, poetic love, and the cult of Pandemos Aphrodite, which can be roughly translated as "Aphrodite of all the people". It spread widely among the common people, manifested in orgiastic celebrations and blessing debauchery as a sacred tribute to the goddess. Similar processes of splitting and polarization of once fused elements are known in some other cultures. There are even more such cultures where the historian clearly sees a later stage: the cult of debauchery and the chaotic mixing of demonic and elemental elements under the false guise of the divine. Ritual prostitution in Canaan, Babylon, India, and other countries is an example of this. Over such institutions, over the celebrations of orgiastic sects, over mass gatherings, and even now, the carosses of nations or super-nations still preside. It is also clear that such phenomena cannot do without the intervention of lunar demonism and the dark forces of Dugur. But when in the struggle against those who threaten the physical existence of the people, their Demiurge seeks ways to create a powerful and militant defender, he is forced to descend to the caross and unite with her. The cursed aecehore inevitably enters their common progeny, and the poisoned flesh of the caross creates a dual monster. This is the origin of all the first members in each clan of uitzraors. The liberation of the caross and Lilith herself from aecehore will probably only be possible in the second zone.

The First and Last of the Supreme Elemental is the mother of all the others, not only of them, but of everything that exists in Shadanakar: every elemental, every animal, human, daemon, angel, demon, and even the great hierarchies. The inexhaustible womb, she is what creates the etheric bodies of all beings, and participates in the creation of their astral bodies along with their personal monads. She is characterized by an inexhaustible warm love for all, even for demons: she mourns and grieves for them, but forgives. "Mother" is what everyone calls her, even the angels of darkness and the monsters of Gashsharva. She loves everyone, but only reveres the highest hierarchies of Shadanakar, especially Christ. She is fertilized by the Sun: both in Enroth and in her own indescribable world, this great, dazzling spirit fertilizes her. She perceives people, their mental state, their inner image; she hears, responds to the call of our hearts, and answers through nature and love. Blessed be her name! She can and should be prayed to with great humility.

Blessed be the daughter of the Earth and the Sun, the beautiful Moon, and thrice blessed be the Sun. We have all once dwelt - with our future bodies and our future souls - in its pure womb, along with all of Shadanakar. Oh great god of light! You were praised in the temples of Egypt and Greece, on the banks of the Ganges and on the ziggurats of Ur, in the land of the Rising Sun and in the distant West, on the Andean plateaus. We all love you, both the good and the evil, the wise and the dark, the believers and the unbelievers - those who feel your heart, immeasurable in its goodness, and those who simply rejoice in your light and warmth. Your dazzling Elite has already created in Shadanakar a staircase of radiant layers, and cascades of spiritual blessings flow down it into the worlds of angels, elementals, and humanity. Beautiful spirit, progenitor and father of all flesh, visible image and likeness of the Sun of the World, living icon of the One, allow me to merge my voice, inaudible to anyone but you, into the universal praise of you. Love us, shining one!

### Chapter 3. Attitude towards the animal kingdom

We often don't realize that a utilitarian perspective on all existing things has become something like our second self for us. Everything in the world is evaluated solely according to how useful it is for humans. But if we already consider the historical and cultural provincialism, which is erected into political theory and is called "nationalism", to be wild, then the cosmic provincialism of humanity will seem just as funny to our descendants. The legend of the "crown of creation" is a legacy of medieval narrow-mindedness and barbaric selfishness, and it, along with the dominance of the materialistic doctrine that patronizes it, must dissipate like smoke.

A new attitude towards the world is emerging: for it, humans are creatures in a grand chain of other beings. Humans are more perfect than many, but also insignificant compared to many others, and each of these beings has autonomous value, regardless of its usefulness to humans.

But how to determine this value in each specific case? What criterion should be taken for this? What hierarchy of values should be established?

First of all, it can be stated that the value, whether material or spiritual, of any object, whether material or spiritual, increases with the amount of effort expended to make it what it is. Of course, when we apply this principle to the evaluation of living beings, we easily realize that it is impossible for us to calculate the sum of these efforts. However, another thing is possible: it is possible to be aware that the higher the level reached by a being on the cosmic ladder, the greater the sum of efforts (its personal, natural or Providential forces) must have been expended on this. The development of human intellect and all his abilities that distinguish him from animals required an immense amount of work - both his own and Providential forces - beyond the work that had previously been spent on raising animals from the simplest forms to the highest. This is the basis of the cosmic hierarchy of values, as far as we can understand it. From it, it follows that the value of an infusoria is lower than the value of an insect, the value of an insect is lower than the value of a mammal, the value of the latter is still far from the value of a human, and the value of a human is small compared to the value of an archangel or the Demiurge of a people, while the value of the latter, despite its scale, is lost next to the value of the Lords of Light, the Demiurges of the Galaxy.

If this principle is taken in isolation, one could conclude that humans are actually irresponsible towards all those below them: since their value is higher, it means that they are naturally entitled to use their lives as they see fit. However, no ethical principle should be considered in isolation: it is not self-sufficient, but rather a part of the overall system of principles that determine the existence of Shadanakar today. The counterweight to the principle of spiritual value can be called the principle of moral duty. At lower stages than humans and even in the early stages of humanity, this principle was not yet realized; now it can be formulated with considerable precision. Here is this formula: starting from the human stage, the duty of a being towards those lower than himself increases as he ascends further up the ladder.

Primitive humans already had a duty towards domesticated animals. This duty did not just involve feeding and protecting them: it was a simple exchange, a duty in a lower, material sense, rather than an ethical one, because in exchange for food and shelter, humans took either the animal's labor, milk and wool, or even its life (in the latter case, of course, they violated the natural balance of exchange). The ethical duty of primitive humans was to love the animal they domesticated and used. An ancient rider who had a deep affection for his horse, a shepherd who showed not only care but also affection for his livestock, a farmer or hunter who loved his cow or dog, all fulfilled their ethical duty.

This elementary duty remained a norm of humanity until today. True, some high-minded souls, whom we call righteous and the Hindus call more precisely "mahatma" (great soul), understood a new and much higher level of duty, naturally arising from their spiritual greatness. The lives of saints are full of stories of friendship between monks and hermits with bears, wolves, and lions. In some cases, these may be legends, but in others, these facts have been accurately documented, for example, in the testimonies of the life of St. Francis of Assisi or St. Seraphim of Sarov.

Of course, such a level of duty towards animals is only inherent in the stage of sanctity, it cannot be the same for the majority of humanity as it was three thousand years ago. But three thousand years is a considerable time. The thesis that we are still doomed to remain at the same level of primitive duty as our distant ancestors is unjustified. If a person wandering in a narrow and murky animistic world could already love his horse or dog, then for us, this is at least insufficient. Does not the colossal journey we have traveled since then oblige us to do more? Are we not capable of loving even those animals from whom we do not directly benefit - wild animals, at least those that do not harm us?

What we conventionally call "shells" or, if you prefer, "souls," that is, the finest immaterial covering created by the immortal monad for itself, are possessed by all creatures, including infusoria: without a shell, no material existence is possible, just as no existence at all is possible without a monad. However, animal monads are located in one of the worlds of High Deeds - in Kaermis, while souls take long paths along an ascending spiral through a special sakuula consisting of several layers. They are embodied here, in Enrof, but many of them do not experience post-mortem descent. The law of karma rules over them, but it is different for them; the untying of knots occurs only in Enrof, on the paths of countless incarnations within the class, with extreme slowness. According to the initial plan of the Providential forces, Enrof was intended precisely for the animal kingdom, that is, for a multitude of monads that descended here with their shells in order to embark on a great creative act: the enlightenment of the materiality of the three-dimensional layer. The intervention of Gagtungra distorted this plan, complicated the paths, disfigured destinies, and horrifyingly extended the deadlines. This was mainly achieved by the fact that from the very beginning of organic life in Enrof, it was subject to the law of mutual devouring.

Why are almost all animal babies so charming and cute? Why do piglets and little hyenas, not to mention wolf cubs and lion cubs, evoke nothing in us but a good and touching feeling? Because the manifestation of the demonic principle in the animal only begins at the moment when it has to enter into a struggle for life, that is, fall under the law of mutual devouring. The little beasts of Enrof resemble the images of animals that they possessed in the neighboring world, from which they first came to Enrof. Even snakes in that layer were charming creatures, playful and very lively. They danced, praising God. And they would have become even more beautiful, intelligent, and wise in Enrof if it weren't for Gagtungra.

His activity drew a sharp line between two halves of the animal kingdom. He managed to demonize one half very strongly, lowering the spiritual development of these animals to an extremely low level, to the point where they could only exist by feeding on their brethren. In general, the predatory principle is demonic in nature, and no matter in which being we encounter it, it means that demonic forces have already worked thoroughly on it. The other half of the animal kingdom was destined as prey for the first. The predatory principle was not abandoned in them, and these species limited themselves to vegetarian food, but their mental development was severely hampered by living in conditions of almost constant flight or hiding from danger.

The goal of enlightenment of the three-dimensional materiality continued to stand before the Providential forces. Since the animal kingdom proved incapable of this, at least for the foreseeable future, the prerequisites were created for one species to be separated from it, which could cope with this task more quickly and successfully. The separation of this species was characterized by a swift leap forward. In this process, the parent species from which the new, progressive species was separated served as a kind of springboard for the jump. And the faster the human race made this leap forward, the further the parent species, which served as a springboard, fell back. Later, this species was formed into a group of monkeys—a tragic example of regression. Thus, our leap from the animal to the human was paid for by the halt of the development of countless other beings.

Animals are demonized the more predatory they are. Of course, this demonization is limited to their shells and denser material coverings; it cannot touch the monad. But demonization of the shell can reach terrifying degrees and cause terrible consequences. It is enough to recall what happened to many species in the class of reptiles. The Mesozoic era was marked by the fact that this class, which had reached gigantic forms by that time, was divided in half. One half that remained herbivorous was given the opportunity to develop further in other layers, and now there is a certain material world called Jimeiro, where the brontosaurs and iguanodons that have passed through countless incarnations now live as fully rational, kind, and unusually affectionate creatures. The other half of the giant reptiles, the predators, evolved in other layers in the opposite direction. They no longer have a physical body, but Karrokh, and they are none other than rampaging as rarrugs in the shrastras.

Jimeira, the current dwelling of the best part of the ancient geological era's animals, is already disappearing: they are moving to higher layers. Two other layers are filled with myriads of beings: Isong is the world of the souls of most currently existing animals, through which they flicker very quickly between incarnations, and Ermastig is the world of the souls of the highest animals; only representatives of a few species ascend there after death, and even then, not all of them. They linger in this world much longer than in Isong.

I recall the wonderful words of the elder Zosima, remarkable for their depth: "Look at the horse or the ox... how dejected and thoughtful they are, look at their faces: what gentleness, what attachment to man, who often beats them mercilessly, what harmlessness, what trustfulness, and what beauty in their faces!" To dare to call a horse or a cow's muzzle a "face" - one needs to possess the strength of true insight.

The surface of things familiar to us has become transparent before the real gaze - not Zosima's, but Dostoevsky's - and through this givenness, he saw the obligation. The obligation of animals. For there is already a world where the souls of many of them, dressed in enlightened bodies, are beautiful and - to say they are highly intelligent is an understatement - spiritually wise. They must eventually reach this world, Hangvill, the highest in Sakual, to rise further to Fayr, Usnorm, and Kaermis.

Oh, the vile traces of Gagtung's paw are visible on many other creatures in the animal kingdom! For example, by pressing on certain animal instincts, he was able to commit acts of violence against them that are difficult to find an analogy for in our layer. He didn't just flatten or crush them, but he made them from individual to collective. The individual instincts of many lower creatures are short-lived manifestations of this collective instinct. For example, most insects, not to mention the simplest ones. The individual instinct of a fly or, for example, a bee, is, if you will, just a tiny swelling on the surface of the collective soul sphere; if a bee or fly dies here in Enrof, this swelling is drawn back into the general sphere, merged into the instinct of the swarm or the multitude of flies. The world of collective souls of insects and the simplest creatures is called Nigoyda: there these collective souls, especially bees and ants, are rational, but in appearance they are similar to the forms of the beings that embodied them in Enrof, but bigger and brighter. Some of them - although few for now - rise higher, to Hangville, and there they become beautiful and wise; they even acquire regalness and magnificence. Hangville is a kind of great common center of the entire animal kingdom, and from there the enlightened animal souls rise through Fayr to the very Usnorm, where they participate in the eternal worship of Shadanakar.

It will seem even stranger what concerns not living animals, but some children's toys. I mean the well-known plush bears, rabbits, and similar trinkets. In childhood, each of us loved them, and each experienced longing and pain when he began to understand that they were not living beings, but simply human-made products. But the joy is that it is not us, but the children to the right, who sacredly believe in the living nature of their toys, and even in the fact that they can speak. With our higher mind, we could observe a completely special process of creation in these cases. At first, such a toy has no etheric and astral body, no shield, and, of course, no monad. But the more a teddy bear is loved, the more tenderness, warmth, affection, pity, and trust are poured onto it from the child's soul, the denser the finest matter, from which the shield is created, is concentrated in it. Gradually, it is created indeed, but it has no astral or etheric body, and therefore the physical body, a toy, cannot become alive. But when the toy, completely saturated with an immortal shield, dies in Enrof, a divine act is performed, and the created shield is linked to the young monad entering Shadanakar from the Father's bosom. In Ermastige, among the souls of higher animals clothed in astral and etheric, an amazing creature appears, for which such clothing must be created here. These creatures are not struck by beauty, and even less so by greatness, but by that indescribable touchingness that softens our stern souls at the sight of a little rabbit or deer. In Ermastige, these creatures are all the more delightful because even in the corresponding toys, there was never a drop of evil. They live there wonderfully with the souls of real bears and deer, receive an astral body there, and then rise to Hangville, like everyone else.

I can barely outline a path to solving the problems related to transphysics and eschatology of the animal kingdom. But even that is enough to understand how much more complex this issue is than what was thought by thinkers of ancient religions. The simplified formula "animals don't know sin" does not reflect the essence of the matter at all. If sin in this case refers to a state of sexual consciousness in which there is no sense of shame and no idea of the prohibition of certain manifestations of the sexual sphere, then animals indeed "don't know" sin. But it would be more correct to say that for them, these manifestations are not prohibited, not punishable by karma, not sin. On the other hand, the concept of sin is infinitely broader than the sexual sphere. Malice, cruelty, unjustified and unbridled anger, bloodlust, jealousy - these are the sins of the animal kingdom, and we have no data to judge to what extent certain animals are aware of these manifestations and their impropriety. Moreover, this does not solve the question of the presence or absence of such a prohibition for them. It is foolish to think that a law becomes effective only when it is recognized. The law of gravity was recognized only by Newton, but it affected everyone and everything. Whether animals are aware of some higher law or not, vaguely feel it or do not feel it at all - it doesn't matter: causality is causality, karma is karma. As far as I understand, a hungry lion killing an antelope is not personally guilty, since it is a necessity for him, but his species or class is guilty - the ancient guilt of all predators. A well-fed tiger attacking an antelope only out of excess personal bloodthirstiness and malice, in addition to the obvious guilt of its class, also bears personal guilt, because he is not forced to kill his victim out of necessity. A wolf defending himself against dogs and killing one of them in a fight is not personally guilty, but guilty as a representative of the predatory species, whose ancestors once made a choice in this direction. Here is a kind of original sin. But a well-fed and pampered cat playing with a mouse for entertainment is guilty of both original sin and personal guilt, since there was no need for her action. They may say that it is the transfer of human, even legal, concepts to the world of animals. But the concept of guilt is not only a legal concept, but a transphysical, meta-historical, ontological concept. In different kingdoms of nature, for different hierarchies, the content of the concept of guilt changes, but it absolutely does not follow that this concept and the reality of karma behind it are inherent only to humanity.

Not a single grain of new ideas has been introduced into this area by the irreligious era of thought. On the contrary, the prevailing view of animals in modern times has been composed of two contradictory elements: utilitarian and emotional. At the same time, the animal world has been divided into categories depending on the relationship of a given species to humans. First and foremost, of course, are domestic animals: they are cared for and sometimes even loved, if a cow becomes ill, tears are shed for it, but if it stops producing milk, it is taken away, sighing sadly, to a place where the beloved animal will be turned into so many pounds of meat. With this meat, the owner, with childlike innocence, will feed himself and his family. The second category includes a significant portion of wild animals, including fish: they are not tamed, not made happy with care, they are simply caught or killed on the hunt. Thirdly, there are predators and parasites: the conversation with them is simple, they are destroyed wherever and however possible. And there is also a fourth group that can be distinguished: this is a certain part of wild animals, especially birds, that are useful in that they destroy pests. This category is allowed to live and reproduce, and in some cases, such as with starlings or storks, even patronage is shown. As for the rest of the animals, from lizards and frogs to magpies and jackdaws, they are sometimes caught for scientific experiments or just for fun, boys throw stones at them, but more often they are simply not noticed from the heights of their own greatness. This is the scheme, of course, a very rough utilitarian attitude towards animals. The emotional element, however, lies in the fact that most of us are capable of experiencing either genuine affection or aesthetic admiration for certain species and individuals. In addition, thankfully, many still have a general compassionate sympathy for animals. Partly because of this sympathy, the animal world owes the fact that in many countries there is even legislation on issues of their protection, and there is a network of voluntary societies dedicated to this protection. In combination with such a powerful ally as utilitarian concern that valuable commercially exploitable species are not completely exterminated, this emotional attitude has made it possible to establish reserves. And in exceptional cases, some reserves have no utilitarian meaning at all, for example, the feeding stations for pigeons that exist in many places.

I am talking, of course, about the attitude towards animals in Europe, America, and many countries in the East. But India presents a completely different picture. Brahmanism, as is well known, has long prohibited the consumption of various types of meat, reduced human food to milk and plant-based food, declared the processing of leather and fur to be sinful and unclean work, and proclaimed cows and certain other species to be sacred animals. And it did a beautiful thing. Of course, the sight of a cow strolling through the market and taking whatever catches its eye from any stall uncontested amuses and offends Europeans. I will not dispute that religious worship of cows is specific to only Indian worldview and cannot be imitated in our time. But the feeling that underlies this worship is so pure, noble, and sacred that it deserves admiration in and of itself. Gandhi explained this psychological basis of cow worship well. He pointed out that in this case, the cow is a representation of all living things that are beneath humans. Reverence for it, serving it in the form of selfless care, affection, and decoration expresses the religious idea and ethical sense of our duty to this world of living beings, the idea of protecting and aiding all that is weak, inferior, and everything that has not yet developed into higher forms. Moreover, this is also an expression of an irrational feeling of deep human guilt towards the animal kingdom because humans distinguished themselves from this kingdom at the cost of the backwardness and degradation of the weaker ones. Having distinguished themselves, they exacerbated their guilt with ruthless exploitation of the weakest. Over the centuries, this human guilt has grown like a snowball and has finally reached immeasurable, incomprehensible proportions. Glory to the people who were able to rise to such an understanding, not in the minds of individuals but in the conscience of many! What idea, what ethics can we oppose to this ethics, we who are proud of the fact that we have been professing Christianity for so many centuries?

In my life, there was one incident that I must tell here. It's difficult, but I wouldn't want anyone to form an impression of the author based on this chapter about animals that he doesn't deserve. The thing is, once, several decades ago, I deliberately and even intentionally committed a disgusting, repulsive act towards an animal that also belonged to the category of "man's friends". It happened because at that time I was going through a certain stage, or rather, a zigzag of the inner path, which was extremely dark. I decided to practice, as I expressed it then, "serving Evil" - an idea immature to the point of foolishness, but thanks to the romantic flair in which I clothed it, it seized my imagination and led me to a chain of actions, one more outrageous than the other. I wanted to know if there was any action in the world that was so low, petty, and inhuman that I would not dare to commit it precisely because of the petty nature of this cruelty. I have no mitigating circumstances even in the fact that I was an unwitting boy or fell into bad company: there were no such companies in my environment, and I myself was a grown-up fool, even a student. The act was committed, and it doesn't matter which animal it was. But the experience was so profound that it turned my attitude towards animals upside down with extraordinary force and forever. And in general, it led to an internal breakdown. And if it weren't for this shameful stain on my conscience, I might not now feel such disgust towards any animal torture or killing, sometimes even to the point of losing self-control. In the list of axioms clear to me as two times two, one of the first places is occupied by this: in the overwhelming majority of cases (excluding only self-defense against predators, parasites, or the absence of other sources of food), killing and especially torturing animals is obscene, unacceptable, unworthy of a human being. This is a violation of one of those ethical foundations on which a person has the right to be called a human being.

Of course, hunting, as the main means of existence for some backward tribes, cannot be subject to any moral condemnation. One would have to be a Pharisee of vegetarianism to "expose" a Göttinger or a Golda, for whom the refusal to hunt is equivalent to death. And each of us, if placed in similar conditions, can and should support human life and the lives of others through hunting: the life of a person is more valuable than the life of any animal. Similarly, a person has the right to self-defense against predators and parasites. It is well known that many Jains and some followers of extreme Buddhist ethics drink water only through a cloth, and sweep the road in front of them with each step. In India, there were even ascetics who allowed themselves to be eaten by parasites. This is a vivid example of how any idea can be taken to absurdity! And the mistake here is that, in order to save the lives of insects and even simple organisms - that is, the least valuable beings - humans are put in conditions that make both their social and technological progress impossible. All types of transportation are discarded as sources of death for numerous small creatures, and even agriculture and soil cultivation are prohibited, as they also lead to the deaths of billions of tiny lives. In modern India, Jains are mainly engaged in free professions and trade. But what would they do if the majority of humanity adopted this view? Such an attitude towards things, which puts an impenetrable ceiling on the upward movement of humanity, cannot be considered correct.

But what are parasites and simple organisms from a transfysical, not materialistic perspective? These are beings that, like most other insects, have collective souls, but are extremely backward on their path. It's not just simple backwardness, but active demonization of collective shells by Gagdtung. In Nigoyda, these shells are in a state of slavery, are only partially rational, and have a long and exceptionally slow road ahead of them to develop. Enlightenment for them will only come with the moment of our planet's transition to the third zone. Currently, parasites, the least valuable beings, thrive and fatten at the expense of higher-value beings: animals and humans. Therefore, we have the right to exterminate them, as there is no other solution at this stage.

Predators exist at the expense of the deaths of beings of the same value, i.e., animals and humans of higher value. Those types of predators whose predatory nature we cannot change must gradually be exterminated in Enrof. Gradually, not only because it is otherwise impossible, but also because during this period, means of even changing their nature may be discovered. Undoubtedly, the nature of many predatory species, especially among higher mammals, can be completely altered. It is enough to remember the dog, a former wolf, now capable of living without meat, even though humans never set out to make the dog a vegetarian. The dog was switched to a semi-vegetarian diet due to purely economic reasons, but the success of this endeavor indicates prospects in this area, barely yet opening up to our experience. Thus, hunting predators is a second type of hunting that cannot be condemned at this stage of humanity. Only another set of measures is necessary alongside it, which I will discuss below.

But what deserves unconditional abolition, even strict prohibition, is hunting as a sport. I am well aware of the outcry that will be raised by lovers of hunting deer and partridges if the demand expressed here becomes widespread in society and turns from the utopian dreams of individual eccentrics into an urgent appeal of the vanguard of humanity. The arguments are easy to predict in advance. All arguments that the twisting mind can come up with when it mobilizes to support the suppressed instinct will be invoked. They will cry out, for example, about the benefits of hunting, which strengthens our body (as if it cannot be strengthened by other means), character, willpower, resourcefulness, courage (as if hunting game exposes a person to any danger). Assurances will be made that hunting is essentially only a pretext, a means, whose true purpose is to enjoy nature: as if one cannot enjoy nature without additional pleasure - the spectacle of a hare chased by a dog. Brilliant psychological constructions à la Knut Hamsun will be erected to prove that the hunting feeling is something inherently inherent in a person and that the charm of hunting is precisely that the satisfaction of this feeling is combined with the feeling of "being in nature": they say, not with the eyes of a city dweller wandering around, not from "outside" do I look at it, but I myself - nature, since I hide behind a tree and lie in wait. But no matter how much you imagine yourself, darling, as part of nature, all your sensations are not worth one look from the fading eyes of a goose shot by you. And all these evasions of a deceitful mind are refuted by one short phrase from Turgenev. A passionate hunter himself, he was honest with both the reader and himself; he understood and expressed firmly and clearly that hunting is not related to love for nature in any way. Here is this phrase:

"I cannot admire nature while hunting - all this is nonsense: you admire it when you lie down or sit down to rest after the hunt. Hunting is a passion, and I don't see anything and can't see anything except for some partridge sitting under a bush. He is not a hunter who walks into the wild to admire nature."

D. Sadovnikov. Meetings. About Turgenev.

It is said openly and clearly. So why do others delude themselves and those around them, justifying hunting with a love for nature?

Ah, I know this type: bravery, honesty, straightforwardness, keen eye, broad shoulders, weathered face, well-spoken, sometimes salty - what a model of a man! He is respected by everyone around him, and he respects himself for his strong nerves (which he considers strength of spirit), his sober view of things (which he thinks of as reason), the size of his biceps (which he sees as worthy of the "king of nature"), and his eagle-like gaze. But if you take a closer look behind this impressive facade, you'll see nothing but a tangle of all kinds of selfishness. He is brave and courageous because he is a physically strong male and because his admiration for his own greatness does not allow him to be a coward. He is straightforward and honest because the consciousness of these virtues allows him to rationally justify his own worship of himself. And as for his eyes, which have seen so much trembling in the creatures he has killed, remaining clear and pure like the heavens - it is not a credit to him, but a shame.

Oh, this type of person is not found among the inhabitants of the taiga or the pampas. He just wants to look like a true wilderness expert, he wants everyone to be amazed at how he managed to so harmoniously combine the cultured European with the proud son of nature. The truth is that he is a product of urban civilization, rational, self-centered, cruel and sensual like it, but with one half of his being atavistically drawn back to long-forgotten stages of culture. You will meet more of them than you want, among physicists and biologists, journalists and administrators, artists and even academics. There is a powerful current in world literature created by such people or those who were affiliated with this type by some essential features of their nature. It splashes in the novels of Hamsun, breaks into the stories of London, gurgles already uncontrollably in the poems and stories of Kipling, and poisons the true love for nature in the charming essays of Prishvin with a poisonous jet. The justification of cruelty as a supposedly inevitable law of life, the cult of zoological egoism, the ideal of a strong predator, heartlessness towards the living, covered by the romance of adventures and travels and sweetened by poetic descriptions of nature - it is time to call all this by its own names!

We have no right, absolutely no right to buy our pleasures at the cost of the suffering and death of living beings. If you don't know how to feel like a part of nature in any other way, don't feel it. It's better to stay completely "outside of nature" than to be an outcast among it. Because when you enter nature with a gun and sow death around you for your own entertainment, you become a pitiful plaything of those who invented death, who invented the law of mutual devouring and who grow fat and swell on the suffering of living beings.

And they will say: "Ha! What about the animals? Millions of people are dying in our century - from wars, famine, and political repression - and he found time to mourn over squirrels and grouse!" - Yes, I found time. And I cannot understand how global wars, repressions, and other human atrocities relate to the issue of animals? Why should animals perish for the pleasure of heartless idlers while humanity finally settles its social affairs and devotes its leisure time to softening its manners? What is the connection between one and the other? Is it only that while humanity torments itself with wars and tyranny, public conscience will be too deafened, stunned, and narrowed to feel the full nastiness of hunting and fishing?

Yes, and fishing. That same fishing that we so love to indulge in against the poetic background of summer sunsets, reveling and resting our souls in the midst of the surrounding idyll, while grasping the wriggling worm with our fingers, piercing its body with a hook, and in childish thoughtlessness, not realizing that it now feels the same as we would if a monster the size of a mountain grabbed our leg, pierced our belly with an iron beam and threw us into the sea, towards an approaching shark.

"Well," they will say, "but you can catch fish not only with worms, but also with bread, spinners, etc." - Yes, you can. And for the caught fish, the thought that it perishes, not fooled by a worm, but by a shiny piece of metal, will undoubtedly be a great consolation.

There are still remnants of the distant past who continue to believe seriously that fish or crustaceans cannot feel pain because they have cold blood. Indeed, in those times, humanity, not understanding animal physiology, imagined that sensitivity was a function of blood temperature. By the way, it was precisely because of this misconception that fish were included in the list of fasting foods by Semitic religions, and even righteous people did not hesitate to indulge in them. God forbid that they be judged: religious experience, no matter how great and noble it may be, does not cover scientific experience (and vice versa); at that time, science was in its infancy, and no one, not even the righteous, was responsible for the thought that cold-blooded animals do not feel pain. But now we know that this is nonsense. Now we understand that a fish wriggling on a hook or writhing on the sand is contorting in pain, not for any other reason! So how about it? Do the white robes of poetic contemplation that we clothe ourselves in during bucolic hours of sitting with a fishing rod not become spattered with blood, slime, and the entrails of living creatures to the point of disgust, those very ones that frolicked in transparent water and could have continued to live if not for our, so to speak, love of nature?

There are still arguments of this kind: in the animal world, everything is based on mutual devouring, so why should humans be an exception? - The idea that everything in the animal world is based on mutual devouring is a lie. Are there not enough animals that feed on plant-based food? Haven't Providential forces extracted hundreds of animal species from the clutches of Gagtungre in at least this one respect? Are there not plenty of completely harmless creatures in nature that are not even physically adapted to meat? The main thing is, how can the thought even cross under a human skull that animal customs can serve as a model for human behavior? And if our hunters admire the "courage" of predators (which, by the way, is not so much "courage" as it is just Yarosvet), why not imitate this predator, say, a wolf, in other ways - well, let's say, in tearing apart a wounded or weakened member of their own pack? And on what basis should one stop imitating only predatory mammals? Why not take even more radical customs as an example - for example, those that prevail among spiders: after fertilization, the male is devoured by the female? I think that our apologists for the "animal principle" do not come up with this brilliant idea simply because they are usually male members of the human race. If the male spider were to devour the female after giving birth, there would probably be adepts of such a courageous course of action among us.

But despite its ugliness, hunting no longer brings as much harm as another source of it, which, alas, has only recently been revealed with the development of science and education.

I take "A Practical Guide for Middle School Teachers" by one J.A. Tsinger, published by Uchpedgiz in 1947 under the title "The Simplest". I open it to page 60 and read the instructions on how to perform an experiment to extract gregarine parasites from the intestinal tract of a flour worm: "The worm is opened from the dorsal side and the section of the intestine is isolated. You can also simply cut off the worm's head and posterior section and then use forceps to extract the intestine from the rear... The contents of the intestine are squeezed onto a slide and examined at low magnification after moistening with water."

And what, do the spectators not vomit during this? Have they already gotten used to it? Have they already learned, with the help of a teacher, to suppress their horror and disgust? Can they now call natural pity "sentimentality"? Perhaps they would even call a boy a "girl" if his hands tremble or if pain, meanness, and shame appear in his eyes.

I turn two pages. "They put the frog to sleep with ether... It can be even easier: take the frog by the hind legs and hold its belly up, then hit its head hard against the edge of the table. Then they cut the frog open from the belly side..."

Perhaps this is really how children get a vivid idea of parasites in a frog's intestines: an idea that is of course urgently necessary for everyone to live. But the teacher, a lover of "simpler" actions, also vividly demonstrates human nastiness.

I'm not yet touching on the fundamental question of whether the natural sciences can do without experiments on "living material". But even if these experiments were a sad necessity, where are the arguments in favor of teaching all school-age children to perform them? Of these children, no more than 20% will choose any natural science or medical specialty. For what purpose should we suppress elementary feelings of compassion and mutilate the very foundations of conscience in the remaining 80%? For what other imagined "good of humanity" should we destroy tens and hundreds of thousands of experimental animals? For what and why, by what right, should lessons in natural science at school be turned into lessons in the killing and torture of voiceless creatures? As if this bloody kitchen could not be replaced with slides, models, and replicas! And if we go down the old road, then having said A, we must also say B. If we accept the visual teaching method, then why shouldn't a history teacher, who tells about the Inquisition, stage an instructive performance to explain to the children how the Spanish boots, the garrotte, the rack, and other achievements of science and technology of that time were applied?

And now a few words about "living material" in general. By the way, naturalists are so accustomed to their terminology that they don't even notice the moral poverty, the hardening of conscience that is heard in this unnatural utilitarian phrase: "living material". So, about living material in scientific laboratories, and in general about this technique in natural sciences. What's done cannot be undone, and the dead cannot be resurrected, and it is idle to debate whether science could have advanced in previous epochs without it. But can it do so now? The instinct of economy of effort is to blame for the fact that the gaze of all naturalists has turned to this technique, which is more direct and cheaper, leading to the goal. Once legalized, it now seems to many to be the only and indispensable one. Nonsense! Laziness and stinginess are generally disreputable qualities, and when they are responsible for such mountains of victims, how can they be evaluated properly?.. Of course, seeking a new technique alone is an unattainable task. Thousands of young doctors, educators, and scientists, embarking on their professional path, naturally feel repelled by the scientific methods that involve the torture and killing of living creatures. But the fact is that every such worker faces a dilemma: either to suppress compassion with reasoning about the good of humanity, or to abandon the path of the naturalist altogether, because there is no other technique. It is clear that the overwhelming majority choose the first option and gradually become involved in practicing these inhuman methods. The search for a new technique can only be achieved as a result of the prolonged efforts of a large collective - a union of workers in various fields of natural science dedicated to this goal. And such an undertaking can only be realized if it is financed by an economically strong institution, either public or private.

But the victims of our "love for nature" and our "thirst for knowledge" are just small hills and bumps next to Mont Blancs and Everests: fish carcasses pulled out during fishing, and the corpses of cows and pigs piled up in slaughterhouses - in short, the corpses we buy in stores and consume at a culturally set table. And even worse: the utilitarianism of technological progress has finally reached the point where it has been found more economical to make crab cans, for example, without killing crabs, but rather by removing the shell from each one while still alive, cutting off their claws and throwing the semi-living remains back into the sea to be eaten by anyone. It would be good to give the inventor of such a crab-canning machine a few years of rest in a solitary cell, so that he can reflect on the question - is he even human at all? And it would be even more comforting if, on the other side of the wall, in the neighboring cell, the wise businessman who introduced these tortures for crabs and lobsters into our industry could take a break from his concerns for the treasury's interests. But - well, let's hope that such atrocities - extremes - will soon be a thing of the past. But what about meat and fish as mass food products? What about leather production? What about fur processing? Even if all this is not very moral, isn't it a necessity? Indeed, the element of necessity is still present here, but, to be honest, it is much less than we think. It can be said that scientific and social progress is thankfully approaching a level where only a burdensome memory will remain of this necessity. Indeed: applied chemistry is improving substitutes for leather every year; artificial furs are becoming cheaper and more accessible than natural ones, and if they still lag behind in quality, this gap will be filled over time. Therefore, conditions are being created for the use of animal tissues in industry to be prohibited. The most difficult, truly difficult question is the problem of meat and fish as food, which many consider necessary for our bodies.

But, actually, why is it necessary? It's not meat and fish per se that are necessary, but a certain amount of carbohydrates and proteins. A certain amount of calories is necessary. These quantities can be introduced into our bodies through other types of food: dairy, flour-based, fruit, and vegetable dishes. Pretending as if we don't know that there are millions of vegetarians in the world, and that they live perfectly well, is a frivolous, if not sharper, approach. We all know very well that for thousands of years there has been a multi-million population that consumes little to no meat - an unpleasant fact for our conscience, but an undeniable one. True, in the conditions of the northern climate, compensating for meat and fish dishes will require more nutrients than in tropical India. It is also true that this compensation is currently more expensive and therefore not accessible to everyone. The question, therefore, lies in the increase of the general material standard of living. But it has become a truism that the prosperity of humanity is growing in progression. And the time when this compensation becomes accessible to everyone is not far away.

Therefore, a certain program emerges, a chain of chronologically sequential actions that will become realistically achievable after the arrival of Rosa Mira to power.

The first group consists of actions to be taken without delay:

1. Ban on cruel methods of animal slaughter in industry and everywhere else.
2. Ban on experiments on "live material" in schools and everywhere else, except in specialized scientific institutions.
3. Complete ban on experiments on animals without anesthesia or pain relief.
4. Creation and financing of powerful scientific teams for the research and development of new experimental methods in natural sciences.
5. Restriction of hunting as a sport and fishing as entertainment, with the task of combating predators.
6. Such a restructuring of the educational system that would contribute to the development of love for animals in preschool and school-aged children, selfless love, based not on an understanding of the usefulness of a particular species, but on an organic need to love and help all the weak and backward.
7. Widespread promotion of a new attitude towards animals.

But the essence of this attitude is not only to protect animals from human cruelty and killing.

This is only its negative aspect, and there is nothing new here. Its positive aspect, which is truly new, consists in providing active assistance to the animal kingdom in the matter of its improvement, in reducing the ways and timeframes of this improvement. What does this mean?

This means establishing "peace" between humans and all animals, except predators; finding ways to re-educate certain predatory species; refraining from using any animals for security purposes; artificially accelerating the mental and spiritual development of certain higher species of the animal kingdom.

Considerable resources will need to be invested in the development of zoopsychology. It doesn't matter! No amount of resources, even a thousand times more, will compensate for the harm we have inflicted on the animal kingdom for thousands of years. A new branch of knowledge will emerge - zoogogy, that is, animal pedagogy. As a result of careful study, such types of predators will be identified that, like dogs and cats, can be re-educated. After all, I have already reminded you that in front of our eyes, a former wolf has become capable of digesting plant food, and this is despite the fact that humans did not suppress, but on the contrary, developed his bloodthirsty instinct in the interests of hunting and guard service. If it were not for this, what cheerfulness, gentleness, and kindness we would now observe in dogs in addition to their loyalty, courage, and intelligence! And what doubts can there be that such work on many predatory species, the work of people armed with knowledge of animal psychology and physiology, pedagogy, and most importantly - the power of love, can re-educate, physically and mentally improve, soften, transform them?

Already now, a dog is capable of memorizing up to two hundred words. And not mechanically, like a parrot, but fully realizing their meaning. This creature has truly colossal potential. Its development has reached a point where the species makes a rapid leap forward. It depends on us to make this radical shift happen before our eyes, so that the unsuitability of some dog organs does not slow it down for centuries. The appearance of speech in dogs is hindered not by their general intellectual level, but by a purely mechanical obstacle in the form of an unfavorable structure of the organs necessary for speech. Its overall development is also hindered by another obstacle: the lack of grasping limbs, or rather, the unsuitability of its paws for the functions that our hands perform. Another branch of animal physiology will develop: the science of the means of biochemical effects on the embryo in the direction of such structural changes that are necessary for the accelerated development of the speech organ and the transformation of the front paws into hands. The mastery of speech, even in the volume of several dozen words, has a reverse effect on the pace of general intellectual development, and after a hundred years, people will have an amazing friend who, thanks to their help, has shortened the path intended for him by several generations instead of hundreds of thousands of years.

The next candidates for accelerated development will likely be cats, elephants, bears, and perhaps some rodent species. The horse, which has advanced significantly in intelligence and has clear ethical advantages over cats and even dogs, unfortunately has a hindering property to its quick entry onto this path: hooves. The same applies to deer and buffalo. The elephant, which has an amazing grasping organ, has another inhibiting property: its size, which requires a huge amount of food. However, it is possible that science will find ways to reduce its size and thus eliminate the main obstacle to its rapid intellectual development. It can be assumed that the elephant's extraordinary charm will not diminish if, with the gift of speech, its size does not exceed that of a current elephant calf.

So, after a certain period of time, the Rose of the World will be able to implement the second group of measures:

1. Prohibition of killing animals for any industrial or scientific research purposes.
2. Sharp restriction of animal slaughter for food purposes.
3. Creation of extensive reserves in all countries for the life of those animals that are not yet domesticated.
4. Free existence - both in nature and in populated areas - of long-domesticated and newly domesticated species.
5. Planning the work of zoopedagogical institutions on a global scale, elevating this work to a higher level, and studying problems related to enriching higher animals with the gift of speech.
6. Careful study of problems related to the artificial weakening of the predatory instinct in animals.

Thus, this creative work of perfecting animals will continue to grow – a work that is selfless, inspired not by our narrow material interests, but by a sense of guilt and a sense of love. A growing love that is too broad to be confined within the boundaries of humanity. A love that will be able to solve the problems that now seem unsolvable; for example, where will all these animals go if humans stop their mass slaughter? Will there be a repeat on a global scale of what happened with rabbits in Australia, where they, multiplying in immeasurable quantities, turned into a plague on agriculture? But these fears resemble Malthusianism transferred to the animal world. It is impossible, of course, to predict the measures that our descendants will find and implement in this direction. The worst scenario would be to establish a certain quota: exceeding it would force the society of the end of the 21st century to resort to artificial birth control of animals. However, there is a possibility that this issue will be resolved differently - in a way that cannot be foreseen by the current level of natural sciences, technology, economics, and ethics. But even in the case of a quota being established, it will still be immeasurably less evil than what is happening now. The amount of suffering inflicted by humans will decrease dramatically, and that is precisely the task at hand.

Correspondingly, the amount of good brought about will increase, expressed in the Indian phrase, "praym saagar" - the ocean of love. A lion lying next to a sheep or led by a child is by no means utopian. It will be. It is the providence of the great prophets who knew the heart of humanity. Not in cages, not even in reserves, but simply in our cities, parks, groves, meadows, not afraid of humans, but caressing and playing with them, working with them to improve the natural and cultural environment and to develop their own being, the descendants of modern hares and tapirs, leopards and squirrels, bears and crows, giraffes and lizards will inhabit. The abundance of means of life will reach dimensions in the next century that seem almost unattainable now.

## Book VI. The Higher Worlds of Shadanakar

### Chapter 1. Before the World of Salvaterra

It's no wonder that information about these spheres is not only scarcer than any other, but almost nonexistent. There are two reasons for this. First, the inadequacy of our concepts and understanding to describe the reality of these spheres in any way, let alone to express them in words. Second, the exceptional height of spiritual insight required to touch these worlds through personal experience. Almost everything reported here is not from direct personal experience, but a transfer of words from my invisible friends. May they forgive me if I have erred in anything, if my consciousness has added something lower, purely human, and clouded this message with subjective impurities.

All the layers initially mentioned here are five-dimensional, and the number of temporal coordinates, that is, streams of parallel times, in these layers exceeds 200. This alone is sufficient to understand how powerless attempts to express the content and meaning of these spheres in human terms are. Familiar concepts of forms will have to be completely abandoned; but even attempts to compensate for this by using concepts of energy, zones of influence, and so on, are also doomed to failure.

Above the zatomis of the Transmifs of the five supreme religions - about which I have already spoken as about five giant pyramids, as if made of shining crystal of different colors - rises the indescribable sakwala of the Synclite of Humanity, consisting of seven spheres. Seas of shimmering enrof - I take this word for lack of a more appropriate one - sparkling with colors unimaginable even for the synclites of metaproimage cultures, wash over structures in these worlds that could be as distantly compared to shining masses of mountains as to structures of unimaginable architecture. The innate dissimilarity between the great creations of human genius and the great creations of Nature no longer applies there, for both principles have merged, finally, in an incomprehensible synthesis for us. What can we think of those exultant, light-filled epics in which the most beautiful spirits have become elementals? Or about the radiant waves of sounds that soar in places as if from the blissful womb of celestial mountains? I will have achieved my goal if at least some of those reading this book feel through these unusual combinations of words, through these images almost devoid of outlines, the presence of such a reality to which our spirit can aspire, but which is almost unattainable for almost anyone living on our poor and dark earth.

The selected few, who currently make up the Synclite of Humanity, do not number more than a thousand people, it seems. No longer having a human shape in our sense of the word, they voluntarily assume the highest, enlightened semblance of it when they descend into the lower layers. The space between the brafmaturas of the Solar System they are able to overcome at the speed of light, carried by its rays.

About the separate spheres of Synclite of Humanity, I know nothing except their names, and only to the extent that I managed to translate them into the sounds of human language^^1.

____________
^^1: Arvantakernis. Diedarnis. Ranmatirnis. Serbaraynis. Magraleynos. Ivaroynis. Nammraynos.

Many, more than a hundred people, have entered the Synclite of the World from Monsalvat and Eden by our time. The ancient and vast metaculture of India has contributed even more. It seems that the last to rise to the Synclite of the World before 1955 was Ramakrishna; thus, from the time of his death in Enrof to entering these highest spheres, about seventy years have passed. However, whole centuries often pass for such ascent. For example, the prophet Muhammad, although his posthumous fate was not complicated by any downward movement, reached the Synclite of the World only relatively recently.

Soon, from the Synclite of Humanity, the long-time prophets Ezekiel and Daniel, as well as Basil the Great, will rise even higher than these spheres. This exhausts everything I can say about the spheres of this sakwala. However, even less, even drier, more protocol-like, will have to be said about the eleven spheres of the next sakwala, the sakwala of the Great Hierarchies.

Yes, these are the worlds of precisely those high entities that we have no way of naming other than great hierarchies: many of them were objects of worship in the ancient religions of various countries. In the images of Egyptian, Babylonian, Greek, ancient Germanic, Aztec, and in some aspects, supreme deities of the Indian pantheon were reflected - although only to a certain extent - these exalted beings, but not as they are now, but as they were, or rather, as they were represented to the consciousness of the peoples who comprehended them in those distant times. Over the centuries since the days of the emergence and flourishing of their cults in Enrof, these hierarchies have risen to the highest heights.

I can say that the spheres of this sakuala are no longer structured according to the principle of the connection of a certain hierarchy with a particular metaculture: the lower layers of Shadanakar, which are divided by vertical sections, forming segments of the metacultures of humanity, have been left far behind, or rather, at the bottom. The layering between the spheres of the Hierarchies of sakuala is determined by the principle of the strength and height attained by each of these entities.

Again, I only know the names of these layers. But the adequacy of their phonetic physiognomy, expressed by letters, does not give me any confidence in their true pronunciation. There is no doubt that these names should be treated only as the roughest approximation: Aolinor, Ramnagor, Playragor, Foraygor, Stranganor, Tseliror, Likhanga, Devenha, Sirinha, Hranga, Ganga.

If, at the stage of meta-historical reflection, reason is given complete freedom, it will naturally be directed towards the introduction of dimensions, ratios, and, forgive me for using this expression, the specificity of the metahistory of categories familiar to it, such as physical and historical layers, and logical science-like norms. In particular, its inclination towards uniformity and order, naively understood as symmetry, will manifest itself this time in the fact that it will seem natural to it for identical groups of hierarchies participating in its life to be above all super-nations in the meta-historical plan. In reality, this is not the case.

Truthfully, there is no super-race (specifically, super-race and not nation) that does not have its own demiurge overseeing it, for then it would not be a super-race, but rather a chance coexistence of several nationalities that are in no way connected to each other by any commonality. And there is no nation that did not possess the Ideal Cathedral Soul (for then it would be an arithmetic sum of personalities that momentarily and randomly came together). But above all, the Ideal Cathedral Soul is by no means a combination of any psychological or other properties of this people, which are obvious to us and determine its historical, distinctive from all physiognomy. The Ideal Cathedral Soul is a creature possessing a single great monad that conceals the prototypes of the nation's highest possibilities and is clothed in the material fabric of multidimensional spaces. As the nation's historical development and the personal maturity of human individuals increase, an increasingly subtle material part of each of them grows.

In almost every metaculture, there are several national cathedral souls, but usually, one of them belongs to a different hierarchy than the rest. Only it is born of God, like the demigod of the superrace, and only it is linked to it by special, mysterious, spiritual, and material bonds of love. Such cathedral souls make up the hierarchy of the Great Sisters; there are about forty of them in earthly brafmatura. A cathedral soul exists for each defined nation, but the rest of them belong to the monads that have been deified. The younger sisters correspond to the spirits of the nations that are part of the superrace but do not play a leading role in its history. However, some of the Younger Sisters follow their meta-historical path without companions - national inspirers; there are also intermediate states that sometimes last for centuries or more, when a nation with its Cathedral Soul and its spirit-inspirer remains outside the metaculture, as it were, between them. As an example, we can mention the Balkan peoples, once part of the Byzantine metaculture. The Greeks, Serbs, and Croats were enslaved by one of the witzraors of the Muslim metaculture and are now in between the Roman Catholic and Russian metacultures. No less tragic is the fate of the Bulgarian nation, also part of the Byzantine superrace and destined for a great future - spiritual and cultural primacy in the Eastern Christian world. The Turkish witzraor forever deprived the Bulgarian nation of such prospects, disfiguring and shortening its spiritual wings. Now it is beginning to become part of the Russian superrace. As for the Romanians, they are only forming as a nation. Their Cathedral Soul and Cathedral Soul-inspirer are still very high, barely maintaining a connection with this nationality in Enrof, and will not soon enter into the fullness of their strength.
The great God-born Monad is also the demigod of the superrace, more powerful, more effective, but alien to the cathedral nature.

One of the Great Sisters in the leading nation corresponds to him in metaculture. However, more complex collisions also occur. In the metaculture of the Northwest, for example, the demiurge of the super-people was associated until the 19th century with one of the Sisters, the Cathedral Soul of Germany. But in this century, the second German witzraor became so strong that the captivity of this Cathedral Soul in one of the citadels of Mudgabrah turned into almost complete enslavement of her will, and the demiurge entered into an alliance with another Great Sister, the Cathedral Soul of England.

The birth of the monads of both hierarchies - the demiurges of super-peoples and Great Sisters - by the Eternal Sun of the World cannot be understood or imagined by us, and any logical reasoning on this subject is doomed to remain an empty speculation. Speculations, in my opinion, will also remain attempts to fill the gap in our understanding of those stages of cosmic formation of these monads that preceded their incarnation in Shadanakar. In which brafmaturas, in which forms, by which stages did they travel and embody before entering the boundaries of our planet? - Perhaps I am mistaken, but it seems to me that such inobrafmaturic secrets are transcendental for us. In the circle of our understanding (and even then not as a meta-historical enlightenment, but only in the form of passive perception of information about it from our invisible friends), both of these hierarchies enter at the moment of meta-ethereal birth. By this term, we conditionally denote an event that consists in their monads entering the five-dimensional materiality of Shadanakar. They receive a certain impulse from the Planetary Logos, which can be understood as a Being who has become the highest demiurge of our brafmatura: this impulse is a creative command to realize and express themselves in the three-dimensional and four-dimensional substances of the future super-people that did not yet exist and could not exist without them. It is this impulse that leads to their descent, clothing in the fabrics of a denser materiality, already four-dimensional, and the beginning, thus, of their planetary cycle. 

This is their second birth in Shadanakar, their astral birth. They never experience a physical birth, of course.

I know that understanding this idea is not very easy, but it is unlikely that it can be expressed more simply. The worlds where these hierarchies reside between their two births, and their monads throughout their cycle in Shadanakar, make up the Sakuala of Demiurges. It consists of three spheres. The homeland of the demiurges and the Great Sisters - ideal souls of super-peoples - is called Rangarajdr. The names of the others are Astr and Oamma. Astr is the homeland and dwelling place of the monads of the Younger Sisters and the spirits of national leaders. I am unable to provide any information about the content of Oamma.

However, it can be said that over the last five hundred years, one demiurge emerged from the number of demiurges who not only received a mission of universal, rather than just super-national significance, but also carried it out: this is the Demiurge of the Northwest. The creation of certain prerequisites for the unification of humanity into a single whole is the fruit of his creativity over the past centuries. In the near future, world leadership of this kind will probably pass for a short time to the Demiurge of the Russian super-people, and then to the Demiurge of India. Later, there will probably be no single leadership.

Yarosvet and Navna are names I have arbitrarily chosen to denote hierarchies of Russian metaculture. The true names of the demiurges and Great Sisters are unknown to me. In any case, they cannot be pronounced in human language.^^1 The meta-historical mission of the future marriage union and life in Shadanakar of Yarosvet and Navna - a mission of planetary significance - can be roughly outlined as their birth, or rather, their ethereal embodiment through them, of a certain Great Feminine Monad.

____________
^^1: I hope that the reader will understand that any application of anthropomorphic concepts familiar to us, such as age, marital relations, etc., to hierarchies can only be done for the purpose of bringing our thoughts closer to understanding phenomena that, in a literal sense, have almost nothing in common with phenomena familiar to us, using only possible, albeit distant, analogies.

Unthinkable in any personal physical incarnation, it is ready to pour into an ethereal receptacle over time, enlightened, personal, living and immaculate; it only arises simultaneously with its embodiment in Enroth: the universal Brotherhood. The Russian people are thought of as their demiurge, still unenlightened in Enroth, but already being enlightened in Heavenly Russia, an ethereal-physical substance from which this double receptacle of Light will be created, and at the same time as an arena on which this theurgic act will be performed.

Above the sakuallas of the Demiurges and Great Sisters hovers a sakualla that I can only define in words: Waves of World Femininity. The first of its spheres, Limuarna, is the feminine Synclite of Humanity, and the second, Bayushmi, is the abode of the Great Feminine Monad at present. Of the remaining spheres of this sakualla, I only know their names: Faolemmis, Saora, Naolitis. The name of the sixth sphere will remain a secret.

This sakualla is encompassed by another - the worlds of communication between the hierarchies of Shadanakar and the hierarchies of the macrocosmic universe. Of these three worlds, I can only name the middle one - Raoris - the abode of the Great Feminine Monad at the beginning, when She emanated into Shadanakar.

From here, the layers of the existence of our Brahmatuhra's Unified Church begin. They include both the Sakuala I just mentioned and the three spheres of even higher Sakualas: the Elites of Shadanakar. Oceans of enlightened and spiritualized matter sway around it; their luminous crests encounter no obstacles in its transparent facets, smoothly flowing inside and, spreading throughout this abode of Perfection, convey to it the fullness of life. Both the humanity of Enroth, the humanity of demons, the humanity of the Moon, the angels, the stihialy, and even the animal kingdom, whose metaphysical meaning was such a deep mystery, find their highest justification, their finally transformed existence in the bosom of this highest heaven, combining tranquillity and power, bliss and creativity, perfection and boundless movement further and further along a dazzling path. These are all those who see the World Salvatore face to face, the highest step of the Shadanakar ladder for any of its monads, both begotten and deified, except for the Planetary Logos, the Most Holy Virgin, and the Great Feminine Spirit.^^2

____________
^^2: Under the term "etheric," I mean a more subtle and elevated materiality than physical. Etheric materiality belongs to the worlds of Enlightenment, Zatomis, and Light Stikhials. The term "astral" is used to denote even more subtle materiality, characteristic, for example, of the Sakwala of High Duty and the Sakwala of Angels, and the term "meta-etheric" is used for the finest of all imaginable materialities. This is the materiality of the highest layers of Shadanakar. The word "spiritual" is applied to everything hierarchically arranged even higher.

The only thing I can do when talking about the Elite of Shadanakar is to list some of those great spiritual personalities who have reached the Elite, their last human names: Akhenaten, Zoroaster, Moses, Hosea, Lao Tzu, Gautama Buddha, Mahavira, Ashoka, Chandragupta Maurya, Patanjali, Nagarjuna, Samudragupta, Kanishka, Shankara, Aristotle, Plato, all the apostles except for Paul, Titurel, Mary Magdalene, John Chrysostom, Augustine, Francis of Assisi, Joan of Arc, Dante, Leonardo da Vinci. Thus, we have brought the overview of the structure of Shadanakar to its end - to the highest of Sakualas, encompassing our entire Brahmatuhra with three spheres: the Sphere of the Planetary Logos, the Sphere of the Most Holy Virgin Mary, and the Sphere of the Great Feminine Monad.

Due to purely subjective reasons, I am used to calling this center and summit of Shadanakar the World Salvatore - a name that is, of course, entirely arbitrary and even accidental, having nothing to do with the Crusaders' medieval Salvatore, Palestine, or even the remotest relation. I do not insist on it in the slightest, but I am forced to use it for lack of a better one.

The World of Salvaterra permeates all of Shadankar except for the four worlds of the demonic foundation and Sufetkha, but to varying degrees. Its greatest completeness is associated with the high layers of the atmosphere. The religious meaning of the word "Heaven" is not the result of aberration of ancient dark minds, but an expression of reality that high souls felt thousands of years ago.

All Providential in the history of Shadankar, in the history of humanity and the individual soul, comes from Salvaterra. It is here that the lower emanation of the higher cosmic Entities is concentrated, expressing themselves in the formation of star worlds as well as in our formation. "The sparkling crystal of the heavenly choice" is a formula applicable to the World of Salvaterra not only poetically. Continuous waves of grace and power pour forth from these heights, from these depths. How can words such as "shining gospel" or "resounding radiance" help us to approach an understanding of them? That which such semi-forms may have hinted at remains deep down in the worlds of angels, in the sakwala of High Duty, in the synclite of the World. Even what the biblical legend of Jacob's ladder attempted to express ends here, passing through all of Shadankar. Great entities and great beings ascend and descend the steps of material existence from Salvaterra to the earth and from the earth to Salvaterra. It is the heart of the planet and its inner Sun. Through it and only through it, the heights, breadths, and depths of the Spiritual Universe are revealed, embracing both the star archipelagos and the oceans of metagalaxy, which seem so barren to us.

The Spiritual Universe is inexpressible in any language and can only be experienced in the most remote intuitions. The highest spiritual ecstasies of Christian mystics, the highest level of ecstasy of Hindus, the "abhidjna" of Buddha - all of these are the states of these remote intuitions. The systematizing mind tries to pour them into solid forms of doctrines to make them accessible to many, creating dull reflections, like the teachings of Dao, Pleroma, Empyrean, or the breathing of Parabrahma.

When wanderers in other worlds speak of Eden, like the teachers of Semitic religions, or of the chambers of Brahma and Vishnu, the Iranian azure heavens, or the Hindu devas, the blessed land of Sukhavati, or even of Nirvana - they only consider them as the ultimate goal of individual stages within Shadanakar, individual peaks of metacultures and the highest transmyths of religions, or finally, the reality of the World of Salvaterra.

When humanity - physical and already non-physical - completes its colossal cycle, when all the kingdoms of the planetary Nature have finished their own, they will fully coincide with this planetary paradise. Then the disclosure of the World of Salvaterra will begin, like a flower opening in the ready-to-receive space of the Spiritual Universe. The Sun of the World will shine over this flower, taking in its fragrant radiation into its heavens.

But the ultimate goal will still be infinitely distant even then, and now it lies beyond any most dazzling intuition.

### Chapter 2. The Logos of Shadanakar

All innumerable myriads of monads, as far as I know now, are divided into two ontologically distinct categories. One is the divine-born monads. There are few of them. They are larger in scale, they directly emerged from the unfathomable depths of the Creator, they are destined to guide the worlds and from the very beginning they undertake it, without knowing any falls or failures, and subsequently only increasing from glory to glory, from strength to strength. The mystery of their divine birth is not comprehended and will never be comprehended by anyone except themselves. In Shadanakar, the planetary Logos, Zventa-Sventana, the demiurges of super-peoples, the Great Sisters, and some of the Supreme Hierarchies belong to the number of divine-born monads. No demonic monad of Shadanakar is included in their number, although it should be known that Lucifer is a divine-born monad, the only one among all divine-born monads who has committed apostasy.

The other category is all other monads of the world, the God-created monads. The mystery of their creation by God can be comprehended by each of them, although, of course, at an extremely high level of ascent.

The planetary Logos is the great divine-born monad, the divine mind of our Brafmatura, the most ancient, the very first of all its monads. Its distinction from all the others is that it expresses, as the Word expresses the Speaker, one of the hypostases of the Trinity: the Son of God. The Logos of Shadanakar accomplishes an absolutely unfathomable path of ascent and creation along the cosmic ladder, and no Brafmatura, except demonic ones, can exist without such a monad. For one such monad appears in each of the Brafmaturas at the dawn of its formation and throughout the development of all its sakuals remains the focal point of the Providential forces and the Divine Spirit.

Planetary Logos descended into Shadanakar as soon as the hierarchy of materiality of Brafmatura became able to receive Him. The layer into which He descended first became Irulon in due course. Through the creative work of the Logos, this layer was prepared to receive many young god-created monads. However, this creative work was not able to protect Shadanakar from the invasion of Gagtungar. The Planetary Logos and the hosts of bright monads were forced to enter into battle with him. Red laws of the world were created that were foreign to suffering, death, and any kind of darkness. The beginning of the first humanity - angelic humanity - was laid by the Planetary Logos Himself and Lilith, whose being was still free from demonic aecexor at that time. Simultaneously with the tireless struggle against the demonic state, Olirna was created, the Sakuals of High Responsibility and the Great Hierarchies, the Supreme Elementals were created, and the layers that became the Sakuals of the involutions of other planets were prepared. Of the layers created at that time, some no longer exist: for example, those to which the angel-humanity rose in those times after reaching enlightenment. And since the materiality of these beings was not poisoned by any aecexor, the ascent of the angel-humanity was not overshadowed by any failure.

The notion of original sin implies the events that occurred between Lilith and Gagtungar when he invaded her world - events that resulted in satanic seed - aecexor - being carried by all beings whose physical-material chains were or are involved in Lilith's creation. In demonic beings, aecexor even dominates over the monads, and in others - in the worst case - over the shells. As for the legend of Adam and Eve, all layers, eras, and hierarchies are so mixed up in it that it is better not to touch this tradition at all. In any case, the general redemption, that is, the illumination of all aecexor, would have been accomplished by Christ in the end if His mission in Enrof had not been cut short.

Mirroring the convergence of angelic monads in Shadanakar, Gagtungar created a dense material layer where smaller demonic creatures found their incarnation, those which eventually turned into the monsters of our days: witzraors, velgs, ryphrs, igvs, and dark angels. And in parallel with the ascent of angelic humanity, organic life began to emerge in Enroth, intended for the animal kingdom. This kingdom was conceived as a grand community of new, young, created, and creative monads of God, called to descend into the densest layers of materiality to enlighten them. However, when Gagtungar managed to distort the laws of life in Enroth and lay his hand on the animal kingdom, thus overthrowing the Providential plan, the forces of the Planetary Logos created a second humanity - the Titans, whose purpose was the same as that of all Light communities: to enlighten matter. Over time, they were supposed to move into Enroth and guide the processes of enlightenment of the animal kingdom and some elementals - demonic or backward. The rebellion and fall of the Titans became a new catastrophe. The collapse of the second humanity was the source of such an increase in Gagtungar's power as he had never experienced before. If the animal kingdom was only slowed down in its development by him, and the Titans were thrown into the worlds of Retribution and later broke free from there, then the Lunar humanity, created by the Planetary Logos and His forces, after the Titans suffered an even more devastating blow and, after going through the phase of demonization of almost all of its shells, disappeared from the face of Enroth completely. This happened about 800,000 years ago, when humans began to emerge from the animal kingdom on Earth, and in other three-dimensional layers, the Planetary Logos and His retinue created the humanity of demons. Their creation was prompted by the urgent necessity of strengthening the Light retinue and the fact that new and new myriads of monads emerging from the Father's womb were looking for ways to descend into the dense material layers for their enlightenment. The task of enlightening the animal kingdom was not assigned to the demons - their layers were not related to animals - but the enlightenment of backward elementals was and remains one of their tasks.

Regarding the so-called dawn of humanity, that is, the era of the emergence of the human species from the animal kingdom, it was an extraordinarily dismal and gloomy dawn. The humanity of the cave age can and should be mourned, but it should not be idealized: it was cruel, base, and crudely utilitarian. It knew absolutely nothing spiritual, except for magic, and magic is utilitarian and selfish by its very nature. A microscopic minority slowly nurtured an incomprehensible feeling of the Great Elementals and the first shoots of the sense of beauty. The first mass experience of the transphysical side of things was the experience of the diffused everywhere arungvilty-prana.

The slow process of spiritual infiltration into the sphere of consciousness went on for millennia, drop by drop; sometimes accumulating in the subconscious, after centuries, like a certain charge of energy, a spiritual quantum, and breaking through immediately into the soul and mind of an individual. These were the first people of noble missions, a kind of messengers. Around them, small communities were created, and the nearest segments of the road to perfection were opened. It is difficult to indicate the exact time when this began, but, in any case, glimpses are already noticeable by the end of the Cromagnon period. Then came a long regression, then new flashes on the American continent, and, finally, on the eve of the formation of the Atlantic culture, they merged into uninterrupted chains of light.

The destruction of Atlantis put at risk all the spirituality achieved during these unhappy centuries. The thinnest thread was carried to Africa and transmitted to Egypt through Sudanese culture. Another thread was thrown to America. There were centuries of painful turmoil for all the forces of Light, because the pressure of darkness was such that the thread sometimes took shape in one single person on earth. Can one easily imagine his unparalleled solitude and the raging of the darkness thirsting to destroy him? There are several strange, unknown names that could be mentioned, but it is better to say that these messengers and heroes of the spirit at the bloody dawn of humanity subsequently wove into their further garlands those most beautiful and brightest flowers whose names are now known to everyone. These are Akhenaten, Zoroaster, Moses, Hosea, Buddha, Mahavira, Lao Tzu, and Apostle John. Future Gautama Buddha withstood particularly fierce struggle. It was among a Negroid tribe in the Lake Chad area when the Sudanese culture did not yet exist, and the dimming flame of the Atlantic wisdom and spirituality warmed in the soul of this one single person. The thread passed to America was broken, and he remained the only light of the spirit in Enrof on the earth. From the point of view of later measures applied to prophets and messengers, he was not so bright, but he was alone, and that says it all. The synclite of Atlantis was too geographically distant to provide him with effective assistance, and he was not yet able to perceive the help of other forces of Light with his wakeful daytime consciousness, and he felt that he was enduring an endless battle in absolute darkness all alone. Fortunately, at the end of that incarnation, he had some worthy disciples, and the cause was saved. That is the incredible nature of his feat: without Synclite!

In the world of daemons corresponding to our Enrof, Jeram, the Planetary Logos, was incarnated about 10,000 years ago, during the height of Atlantis. It was impossible to interrupt or distort His mission in the world of daemons of Gagtungar, nor to physically kill His incarnation before it fully manifested the power of the Logos. The path of the Logos in the world of daemons turned into His apotheosis, and this sakwala embarked on a path of successive enlightenments. The Logos' mission in relation to the world of daemons was similar to His later mission in relation to our humanity, but there it was brought to a victorious conclusion, leading to the accelerated development of this sakwala.

Before achieving the incarnation that fully reflected His essence, the Great Spirit performed a preparatory descent, incarnating about 7,000 years ago in Gondwana as a great teacher. However, humanity was not yet ready to receive the spirituality that flowed through the incarnated Logos. Only a deep and pure esoteric teaching was established, with the first seeds carried by the winds of history to other lands and cultures: India, Egypt, China, Iran, Babylon. The incarnation of the Logos in Gondwana did not yet possess the completeness that later manifested in Jesus Christ; it was essentially a preparation.

The people, culture, and country that were supposed to become the arena of Christ's life did not become clear at once. As a necessary condition, there had to be a clear monotheism, not professed by individuals, but already perceived by the masses. Without this, the psychological groundwork necessary for the revelation of the Son of God would be absent. However, the geographical and historical conditions that determined the cultural and religious character of the peoples of India and China did not provide monotheistic ideas with ways of penetrating the consciousness of the masses. Both the monotheistic teaching of Lao Tzu and similar tendencies in Brahmanism remained almost esoteric doctrines. Everything was limited to spiritual enthusiasm of individual high souls and secluded theosophical speculations. The unparalleled religious talent of the peoples of India conditioned their perception of the revelations of many Great Hierarchies and the creation of a synclite, incomparable to any other in terms of its size. However, the mighty pantheon of India seemed to overshadow an even higher reality of the World of Salvaterra. Indian religious consciousness had long been accustomed to the idea of the incarnation of hierarchies in the form of humans and even animals; therefore, it would not be able to perceive the perfect exclusivity and peculiarity of the incarnation of the Planetary Logos, its complete and fundamentally non-similarity with the avatars of Vishnu or with the incarnations of any other bright forces. Buddhism, powerful in its ethical side, avoided the clear formulation of the problem of the Absolute. Buddha, like Mahavira, believed that in the matter of salvation, a person should rely only on himself. This mistake was influenced by the negative side of the terrible spiritual experience he gained during his lonely burning in the planetary night, an experience that he remembered when he became Gautama, but which he apparently could not fully comprehend. In any case, the Buddhist teaching, which avoided direct appeal to the One, by its wide dissemination in India, finally crossed this country out of the list of possible arenas for the incarnation of the Planetary Logos.

In the 14th century BC, the first attempt in world history to create a distinctly formulated solar monotheism as a national religion was made. This happened in Egypt, and the colossal figure of the pharaoh-reformer still looms on the horizon of past centuries as the image of one of the first prophets in history. What complete loneliness this genius poet and seer must have felt, finishing his inspired hymn to the One God with a tragic lament: "And no one knows You except Your son, Akhenaten!"

However, this lament cannot be understood with absolute literalness: there was at least one person who shared his loneliness. The role of his wife, Queen Nefertiti, as an inspirer and participant in the religious reform, can hardly be exaggerated by anyone. This amazing woman walked across the golden sands of her country as a messenger of the same Heavenly Light as her husband, and for a long time they both, inseparably linked by creativity and divine love in all ways, reached the highest worlds of Shadanakar.

Akhenaten's attempt, as is known, failed. Not only was the cult he founded abolished, but the very name of the reformer was erased from the annals of Egyptian historiography; the historical truth was only restored at the end of the 19th century by the efforts of European archaeologists. Along with the failure of this plan and the long, stable dominance of polytheism, Egypt was also excluded from the possible arenas for the embodiment of Christ.

To clear monotheism could not develop in Iran, nor did Mazdaism. The colossal transmyth of this religion was not contained in its myth even in a small measure. Responsibility for this, of course, does not fall on its founders, because they, and foremost Zarathustra himself, prepared a religious form that was sufficiently capacious to contain an enormous amount of content. The responsibility falls on the witzraors of Iran and its shrastr. Their reflection in Enrof - the empire of the Achaemenids - managed to slow down all spiritual development, cause ossification of the religious forms of Mazdaism, smother its mysticism, petrify its ethics, direct the flow of aesthetics not towards religion, but towards themselves, and redirect the spiritual energy of the nation towards the creation of a great power state. When this empire finally fell and the Cathedral Soul of Iran was briefly liberated, the time was missed. The religion of Mithras, which was spreading at that time, bears the imprint of a too hasty creation, of a revelation that was too indistinct. The gaze of the Chooser finally stopped on Judaism.

The meta-historical study of the Bible made it possible to trace how the prophets of this people were inspired by its Demiurge; how distorted, but still his voice was captured by the creators of the books of Job, Solomon, Jesus Sirach; how at first, inspiration from Shalem was added to this revelation, diminishing it, from the elemental mountain of Sinai, from the spirit of harsh, stern, and stubborn; and how later the books of the Old Testament begin to be increasingly clouded with notes of anger, rage, militancy, and merciless demands: the characteristic intonations of the witzraors. But monotheism, as a national religion, was necessary, and here, it was given after all; in this lies the historical and meta-historical merit of Judaism.

What is important is that, despite countless substitutions, despite the confusion of instances that inspired the reason and creative will of the creators of the Old Testament, the monotheistic religion was not crushed and under Him, the God of the Bible, it is possible, although not always, to understand the Almighty.

The extent to which meta-historical knowledge allows us to understand the tasks of Christ, which He faced in His earthly life, can be determined as follows: the imparting of humanity with the Spirit of the Spiritual Universe instead of speculations about it using speculative philosophy and lonely premonitions; the revelation of spiritual perception organs in man; overcoming the law of mutual struggle for existence; straightening the iron ring of the Law of Karma; abolishing the law of violence in human society and, consequently, states; transforming humanity into brotherhood; overcoming the law of death, replacing death with material transformation; raising humans to the level of God-humanity. Oh, Christ should not have died - not only a violent, but also a natural death. After many years of life in Enrof and solving the tasks for which He accepted this life, He was waiting for transformation, not death - the transformation of His entire being and His transition to Olirna in the eyes of the world. Once completed, Christ's mission would have brought about the establishment of an ideal Church-Brotherhood on earth instead of states with their wars and bloody orgies, two or three centuries later. The number of victims, the amount of suffering, and the time of humanity's ascent would have been immeasurably reduced.

On the basis of Christ's Church in Enrof preceded the descent of the forces of the Ever-Virgin Mother, another hypostasis of the Trinity, into the higher worlds of Shadanakar. This descent did not have a personal character, nor did it involve the descent of any god-born monad. This descent was not the first by femininity in terms of time. The first descent of femininity during the period of our humanity took place fourteen or twelve centuries earlier, and echoes of intuitive understanding of this fact can be found in some myths, where it is inseparably merged with traditions of sacrificial descents of congregational souls of supernations into the dark layers, as we see, for example, in Babylon. But twice, specifically in Babylon, and the second time specifically during the era of the first descent of femininity, the brightest of the god-created monads took on human form, which was to later become the Planetary Logos Mother on earth. Her life path that time did not take her beyond the limits of a small city in Sennar; she was a great righteous woman there and suffered execution. At the moment of her death, the World Femininity enlightened her entire being, which predetermined what she later became - the Mother of God. Even earlier, before Babylon, she lived in Atlantis, where she was simply a beautiful woman and mother of many children, and before Atlantis, at the dawn of human civilization, she lived in a small town in Central America. This town is completely forgotten, and its poor remains will never be extracted from under the tropical thickets of Honduras or Guatemala. In the era of primitive societies, the monad of the future Mother of God did not take human form.

The second descent of the forces of the World Feminine in Shadanakar caused, as an echo, a softening of the spiritual hardness in the beings of many people in Enroth: without this, the establishment of the Church on earth by Jesus Christ would have been completely impossible. The Christian churches, in the interrupted, unfinished form in which they are known to us through history, are pale, embryonic, limited and distorted reflections of the Church of Shadanakar, which abides in the highest realms.

From the age of fourteen to thirty, Jesus was in Iran and India, where He passed through the deepest wisdom achieved by humanity at that time, and left it far behind Him.

Why did Jesus not put His teaching into written form? Why did He choose to entrust this task to His disciples? After all, even though they were inspired by God, the evangelists remained human, and the great adversary did not rest, and even in the books of the New Testament, his distorting touch is clearly discernible in places. But Christ could not express His teaching in a book because His teaching was not only His words, but His entire life. His teaching was His immaculate conception and His birth on a quiet Bethlehem night, illuminated by the singing of Angels; His conversation with Hagtungrom in the desert and His travels along the Galilean roads; His poverty and His love, healing the sick and raising the dead, walking on water and transfiguration on Mount Fabor. His martyrdom and resurrection. Such a teaching could only be expressed, albeit with gaps and errors, by living witnesses of this divine path of life. But the ancient enemy crept into the gaps; penetrating the human consciousness of the authors of the Gospel, he managed to distort many testimonies, distort and darken ideas, lower and limit the ideal, even attributing words to Christ that the Savior of the world could not have spoken. We still have no way to separate the genuine from the erroneous in the Gospel, no precise criteria, no clear evidence. Everyone who reads the New Testament should remember only that the teaching of Christ is His entire life, not just His words; and in the words attributed to Him, everything that is in accordance with the spirit of love is true, everything that is marked by the spirit of severity and mercilessness is erroneous.

It is difficult to say at what point in Jesus' earthly life anxiety arose in his soul, doubt about the feasibility of his mission in all its fullness. But in the last period of his preaching activity, readiness to accept that the Lord of the dark forces could turn out to be a temporary, partial victor becomes increasingly clear in his words - as far as we know them from the Gospel. Indeed, the visible form of such a partial victory was the betrayal of Judas and Golgotha.

The subjective motive of Judas' betrayal was that Christ, through his incarnation, had destroyed in Judas' soul the Jewish dream of the Messiah as a national king, the ruler of the world. This dream had burned passionately in Judas' heart all his life until the day he met Jesus, and its destruction was a great tragedy for him. He had no doubts about the divinity of Jesus, and his betrayal was an act of deadly hatred, a clearly conscious deicide. The thirty pieces of silver, the motive of greed, were merely a hastily taken disguise: he could not reveal to people the true motives of his crime! It was the nature of these true motives that caused such an unprecedentedly severe form of karmic retribution, which was his descent into the Jurgen.

Hence, it is clear what immense importance the events unfolding in Jerusalem after Jesus Christ's triumphal entry into this city had. At this moment, the Planetary Logos could not yet prepare his incarnation for transformation; Golgotha condemned Him to a painful human death. He did not want to avoid execution, although he could have: it would have been a retreat, and anyway, Hagthungar would have killed him a little later. But after death, another kind of transformation became possible for him: resurrection. And between these two acts, the shocking descent of Shadanakar and the disclosure of the eternal gates of these worlds truly earned Jesus the name of Savior. He passed through all the layers of magma and the core; only the threshold of Sufetha proved insurmountable. All the other thresholds were shifted, the locks were broken, the sufferers were lifted - some into the worlds of Enlightenment, others into the realms of Sakual, and still others into the upper layers of Vengeance, which began to be transformed from eternal places of suffering into temporary purgatories. Thus began the great, later growing mitigation of the Law of Karma.

The physical body of the Savior, which rested in the tomb, was enlightened and, having been returned to life, entered into another, higher layer of three-dimensional materiality - into the Olirna. The properties of His flesh, which were observed by the apostles between His resurrection and ascension - the ability to pass through objects in our layer and, at the same time, the ability to eat, the ability to overcome space unusually quickly - are explained precisely by this. The same new, second transformation, which is described in the Gospel as ascension, was nothing else but the transition of the Savior from Olirna to an even higher layer among those that existed at that time. After some time, He carried the transformation of the Mother of God Mary, and a few decades later - the apostle John. Later, transformations were also performed on some other great human souls.

Gradually ascending from strength to strength, for nineteen centuries the Resurrected has been leading the struggle of all the bright principles of Shadanakar against the demonic principles. In the early centuries of Christianity, new enlightening layers were created - Fair, Nertis, Gotimna, then Usnorm, and the movement of many millions enlightened through this Sakwala was accelerated. Through Christian churches, a powerful stream of spirituality flowed, thinning and enlightening more and more human souls; sparkling zatomises of Christian metacultures with their multi-people, becoming brighter synclites emerged and flourished. The most grandiose process of turning suffering into purgatory by our time has hardly reached half of its path: the Sakwala of Magm awaits transformation, and the purest purgatories must gradually change even more. The element of retribution will be completely eliminated from them; for souls with a burdened etheric body, such spiritual assistance from synclites will replace it, which can be likened not to punishment, but only to healing.

Over these centuries, Mother Mary has fulfilled her ascension from world to world. She is the helper of all those who suffer, especially those who are tormented in the underworld. She is the Universal Intercessor and the Great Mourner for all and everything. Like her Son, she resides in the World of Salvation, taking on a luminous etheric garment to descend to other layers. The Savior, who dwells as the Planetary Logos in the inner chamber of Salvaterra, has possessed the power to clothe himself in luminous etheric bodies that he creates. He descends to Zatomis in this manner, communicating with the synclites of metacultures. His power has increased immeasurably, but we are not yet able to comprehend the meaning of the processes that have occurred in the highest worlds of Shadanakar during these two millennia, although the most important aspects are clearly contained in them from the perspective of metahistory.

But if the otherworldly struggle of Jesus Christ with demonic forces was marked by a series of world victories, then the incompleteness of His mission in Enroth was reflected in an inexhaustible multitude of tragic consequences.

The very doctrine turned out to be distorted, confused with elements of the Old Testament - precisely those elements that were overcome by the life of Christ, and if this life had not been cut short, they would have been finally overcome. The main characteristic of these elements is the introduction of traits of a fearsome, merciless judge, even avenger, into the image of God, and the attribution of inhumane laws of nature and moral retribution specifically to Him. This ancient substitution serves as a significant obstacle on the ascending path of the soul: confusion in the consciousness of the divine and the demonic forces makes one reconcile with the idea of the justification, eternity, and immutability of those very laws for which Gauntlgrym is responsible, and which must be lightened, spiritualized, and fundamentally changed. Such a lowering of the level of ethical understanding naturally leads to a concentration of attention on one's personal salvation, while the impulse of social compassion and active striving for the enlightenment of the world are paralyzed.

The incompleteness of Christ's mission is reflected in the fact that the material aspect of nature and the fleshly aspect of humanity did not receive the enlightenment intended for them on a universal scale, not just within the nature of Christ himself. And, remaining unenlightened, they were cast out by the Christian church beyond what it embraced, accepted, and blessed. The sacraments of baptism and communion severed the neophyte from the pagan justification of the self-willed fleshly beginning; no other higher understanding was given. This ascetic tendency of Christianity, barely softened by the compromise institution of the sacrament of marriage, this polarization of the concepts of "spirit and flesh" which Christianity brought with it to all the cultures it touched and which ultimately led to the irreligious era of civilization, was not a simple coincidence or even just a phenomenon of one historical plane. On the contrary, this reflected the peculiarity inherent in Christianity in its meta-historical destiny, a peculiarity predetermined by the very interruption of Christ's mission in Enroth.

The main thing is that there was no fundamental shift in Enroth at all. Laws remained laws, instincts remained instincts, passions remained passions, diseases remained diseases, death remained death, states remained states, wars remained wars, tyranny remained tyranny. The formation of the church in humanity burdened with its former self-will and not protected from dark inspirations could not have brought about the swift spiritual and moral progress that would have occurred if Gagtungr had not cut short the life of Christ. Therefore, for nineteen centuries, humanity has moved along a broken, zigzagging, uneven, and one-sidedly narrowed path: the resultant of the work of Providential principles and the furious influence of Gagtungr.

The half-hearted nature of the victory of the great demon plunged him into a prolonged state that could not be compared to anything human, except for extreme rage. This frenzied rage echoed throughout Enroth, causing unprecedented turmoil in the course of world history. A series of monstrous tyrants on the throne of the Roman Empire, which marked the first century AD, their atrocities unparalleled by anything before or after them, their bloodthirstiness, pride, madness, their inhuman inventiveness in devising new methods of torture, the grotesque distortion of their creative impulse, which led them to erect structures unheard of in their grandeur but either pandering to the basest instincts of the masses, like the Coliseum, or utterly meaningless, like the absurd projects of Caligula - all these are echoes of the fury of the one who saw that His eternal enemy, though detained on His path, had become more powerful and would now grow from glory to glory.

Several centuries before Christ, a formidable weapon was found in Gahtungrom: it was possible to embody in the appropriate layers certain huge demonic beings and begin the first dynasty of Witzraors in Babylon-Assyria and Carthage. One of its descendants, the Witzraor of Judaism, conscientiously aided his master in his struggle with Christ during the Savior's life in Enroth. Without this Witzraor, it would hardly have been possible to completely capture the will of Judas Iscariot and many Jewish pastors who imagined that by persecuting and executing Christ, they were defending the interests of their people. But even beyond this, the "Smart Spirit" understood well that the creation of two, three, or several predatory beings of the same type and layer would, by the law of the struggle for existence, lead to the victory of the strongest of them, until the strongest of the strongest spreads his power in the future over all strata and over the entire earthly Enroth - the power of his human machines. Thus everything will be prepared for absolute tyranny. It was for the realization of this idea that Witzraor dynasties were also created in Iran and Rome, and the Roman one proved to be stronger than the others.

It seems that in the first century, after the resurrection of Christ, the main hope of Gagtungr was placed precisely on Forsuf - the governor of the Roman Empire. Moreover, it seems that even the forces of synclites then did not have the confidence that the madness of Gagtungr, which doubled his strength, would not lead in the near future to the appearance of the Antichrist and would not shorten the terms of the first zone, thereby multiplying the number of spiritual victims to unimaginable proportions and complicating the tasks of the second zone to the extreme. This alarm explains the apocalyptic, or more correctly, eschatological mood, the expectation of the end of the world in the near future, which engulfed Christian communities and Judaism in the first decades after the resurrection of Christ. Fortunately, these fears did not come true: the forces of Gagtungr at that time were enough only for fantastically absurd bloody madness against the Caesars and attempts to physically destroy the Christian Church. However, already in the middle of the first century, another line of activity of Gagtungr is outlined. Taking advantage of the fact that the mission of Christ in Enroth remained unfinished and therefore the Church founded by Him, instead of a universal apotheosis, barely flickers in the form of several small communities under the heavy layers of state institutions created by governors and under the oblique thicknesses of the psychology inverted by them, the forces of Gagtungr begin to interfere in the life of the Church. A highly gifted and deeply sincere willed personality emerges, in which Jewish obsession and aggressive Jewish severity are combined with a rational-legal consciousness of a Roman citizen in his impulse to Christ. This person was the carrier of some mission, undoubtedly bright, but the mentioned personal and hereditary traits distorted his understanding of this mission by himself. Instead of continuing Christ's work, instead of strengthening and enlightening the Church with the spirit of love alone, the thirteenth apostle develops a huge, wide-ranging organizational activity, cementing scattered communities with strict statutes, uncompromising unity and even fear, since the danger of being expelled from the bosom of the Church in case of disobedience created precisely spiritual fear. The fact that the apostle Paul never met Jesus Christ during his lifetime and was therefore deprived of all the grace that emanated directly from Jesus is no less significant than another fact: that Paul did not experience, like the other apostles, the descent of the Holy Spirit. Nevertheless, the other apostles seem to take a backseat, each narrowing their activities to local tasks, to creating Christian communities in one country or another, while the graceless Paul gradually becomes the central figure, rising above all the communities, uniting them all, and dictating to them what he believes to be the continuation of Christ's work.

Perhaps this is the first clear manifestation of Gagtung's determination to fundamentally change the demonic plan. By the end of the 1st century, the situation suddenly changed and the entire atmosphere at the top of Roman government changed. The last emperor on the throne, Domitian, fell victim to conspirators. The era of imperial madness was abruptly interrupted. For the next century, quite worthy monarchs succeeded to the throne. They, of course, do what the logic of power requires of them, that is, the will of the demon Forsuf, they try to strengthen the state system that provided Forsuf with such an inexhaustible flow of red nutritious dew (called shavva), but there are no longer any former inflamed dreams of universal autocracy, no delusional building projects, no "living torches," that is, Christians covered in resin and set on fire, with which Nero illuminated his orgies. State life enters a more or less normal course. In other words, Forsuf is concerned with prolonging his existence, but there are no longer any aspirations for world domination. The axis of the highest demonic plan has changed. The idea of ​​bringing the Roman Empire to the stage of planetary domination has been discarded. The focus is now on taking over the Christian church from within.

Despite all the distortions caused by the spiritual limitations of the human thousands who created it, the Christian church (and later churches) was a mouthpiece for a powerful spiritual current that flowed down from planetary heights. In the eyes of the "Intelligent Spirit," the church became a factor of paramount importance, and all means were used to capture it from within. Semitic religious exclusivity, Greek spiritual separatism, Roman ruthlessness and thirst for political hegemony at all costs - all were brought to bear in the second, third, fourth, and fifth centuries of the Christian era. To achieve the main goal, it was certainly not enough, but to distract the church from its direct tasks, to cloud it with a spirit of hatred, to involve it in an ocean of political turmoil, to replace timeless spiritual goals with current worldly ones, and to subject its eastern half to the power of emperors, and its western half - to the ideas of falsely understood theocracy - was quite successful. The church becomes a secular power - the worse for it! Humanity is still far from the moral heights where it is possible to combine secular leadership with ethical purity.

My ignorance prevents me - not to mention painting a panorama of the nineteenth-century struggle of Gagtung with the forces of the Resurrected - but even to outline its main stages. Only a few, very few, of its links are more or less clear to me.

Little by little, the meta-historical significance of the personality and activities of Muhammad becomes clearer. Taking the point of view of any orthodoxy, Muslim or Christian, it is relatively easy to give one or another positive or negative evaluation of his activity. However, striving to maintain objectivity inevitably leads to considerations and arguments, the inconsistency of which does not allow for a final judgment. It would seem that neither the religious genius of Muhammad, nor his sincerity, nor his inspiration by high ideals, nor the special fiery persuasiveness of his preaching, which makes him a true prophet, a messenger of the upper world, can be doubted. On the other hand, it is unclear what exactly can be considered progressive in his teaching compared to Christianity. And if there is no such progressiveness in his teaching, then why was it necessary for humanity? The attitude towards Muhammad as a false prophet does not help to clarify the matter either, as it remains completely unclear how a religious falsehood could still become a channel through which spirituality flows into the masses, raising millions and millions of souls in fervent worship of the One God.

Meta-historical understanding provides an unexpected answer to these questions, which is equally unacceptable, unfortunately, for both Christian and Muslim orthodoxy. The point is that the correct answer can be found only if we are convinced that Muhammad appeared at the historical moment when the emergence of a true false prophet had already been prepared by Gagdtungr. It was a figure of enormous scale, and equally enormous was the spiritual danger posed by this creature over humanity. The false prophet had to detach a number of peripheral peoples from Christianity who had adopted this religion superficially, entice a number of other nations who had not yet joined Christianity, and in Christianity itself, arouse the strongest movement of direct demonic orientation. The imperfection of the Christian Church was the soil on which such a poisonous seed could bear the richest fruit, culminating in the establishment of a group of overt and covert supporters of Gagdtungr under the patronage of spiritual and state power.

The Prophet Muhammad was a carrier of a high mission. Its meaning was to involve the young and pure Arab people, who had barely touched Christianity, in a movement that would ignite a fiery movement towards religious reform in the Christian church. This reform aimed to purify Christianity from the extremes of asceticism on the one hand, and from the subordination of the church to state authorities and the theocratic autocracy, which the papacy had already been striving for, on the other hand. However, Muhammad was not only a religious preacher; he was a brilliant poet, even more of a poet than a messenger of the upper world. He was one of the greatest poets of all time. This poetic genius, combined with some other traits of his nature, led him away from the strict religious path. The stream of his powerful poetic imagination entered the channel of his religious creativity, distorting and clouding the revelation given to him. Instead of reforming Christianity, Muhammad allowed himself to be carried away by the idea of creating a new, purer religion. And he did create a religion. But since he did not have enough revelations to truly say something new after Christ, the religion he created turned out to be regressive, though not false or demonic, compared to the teachings of Christ. This religion really drew those peoples into its stream who, without Muhammad, would have become the prey of whoever Gahtungg was preparing. Therefore, the final assessment of Muhammad's role cannot be entirely negative or entirely positive. Yes, he was a prophet, and the religion he created is one of the great religions of the right hand; yes, the emergence of this religion saved humanity from great spiritual catastrophes. But by denying many basic Christian ideas, this religion regressed to a simplified monotheism; it essentially offers nothing new, and now it is clear why there is no Islamic transmif among the Great Transmifs, among the five crystal pyramids shining at the heights of Shadanakar.

Here I will only mention one more line of the demonic plan, without knowledge of which it is impossible to understand further, and which must become, in its time - both in history and in meta-history, if I may say so, the main highway.

Speaking about the fact that no demon, however grandiose he may be, is capable of generating a single monad, I hoped that due attention would be paid to this circumstance. After the incarnation of the Planetary Logos, humanity became the decisive arena of struggle, and in the demonic mind, a dream crystallized: to create, albeit slowly, such a human machine that would be able to implement absolute tyranny in the historical plan and turn the population of the earth into devilish humanity. Once again, the creative poverty of demonic elements manifested itself: it was not possible to invent anything self-sufficient; one could only surrender to the laws of thinking "by opposition" and paint pictures that were mirror-distorted and opposed to the forces and paths of Providence. The cosmos was opposed to the anti-cosmos, the Logos to the principle of form, the God-man to the devilish humanity, Christ to the Antichrist.

Antichrist! By introducing this concept into the circle of the present concept, I will scare off more readers than, perhaps, I scared off with all the preceding chapters. This concept has been discredited many times: both by its flat, superficial, vulgarized content and by the abuses of those who declared their political enemies to be servants of the Antichrist, and by the unfulfilled prophecies of those who already saw the features of the approaching Antichrist's kingdom in the traits of long-gone historical epochs. But even if by introducing this resurrected concept I scare away ten times more people than I do, the concept of the Antichrist is still introduced here, tightly connected with the whole concept, and will not be eliminated from it as long as it exists.

Since Gagtungur is unable to create monads and demonic monads cannot be incarnated in humanity, he had to use one of the human monads for his plan. No matter what dark mission a person accomplishes or what terrible mark they leave in history, all this darkness comes not from their monad, but from their shelter. Only the shelter can be demonized, not the human monad. In those rare cases, like with the founder of the kingdom of Igva or with Klingzor, when a person, having achieved a state of ultimate consciousness, commits apostasy, it is not the monad that does it, but only the shelter. At the same time, something truly terrible happens: the rejection of one's own monad precisely because it cannot sanction apostasy, and the complete surrender of oneself - that is, the shelter and all its material coverings - to the will and power of Gagtungur. The connection between the monad and the shelter is severed. The monad departs from Shadanakar to begin its journey anew somewhere in other brahamphaturas, while the shelter is either given to some demonic monad that does not yet have a shelter for some reason, or becomes a direct instrument of Gagtungur, with the absence of the monad being partly compensated by the influence of its own spirit. In both cases, the shelter is finally demonized, that is, there is a gradual transformation of its material substance: siayra - the materiality created by the bright forces of brahamphatura - is replaced by so-called agga - the materiality of demonic origin; the same happens with the astral body. (Structurally, agga differs from siayra in that it lacks microbrahmphaturas, and its elementary particles are not animated or even partially intelligent beings, as in siayra, but dead indivisible material units. Agga consists of only eleven types of such dark anti-atoms, representing countless combinations of them.) - Naturally, beings with such demonized shelters and astrals can no longer be born in any layers except for demonic ones. Thus, the possibility of incarnation in humanity is excluded for them.

And since the plan was to create an Antichrist by embodying it in humanity, there was only one option left for Gagtungur: to capture one of the human monads, sever all the coverings that enveloped it - the Shelt, Astral, and Ether - and gradually create other coverings for it made of Aggi. Destroying its previous, bright Shelt was not in Gagtungur's power, but once deprived of its monad, as if spiritually beheaded, it could remain in a state of indefinitely long spiritual lethargy somewhere in a peculiar transphysical tomb, in the corners of Gashsharva. Abducting the monad required incredible effort and long preparation. It was only successful in the 4th century AD, when Gagtungur managed to snatch one human monad from Irolna, which had once passed through incarnation in the time of the Titans and was now connected to the Shelt, barely completing its journey through Enroth in the form of one of the Roman emperors. However, the uniqueness of such a being caused apprehension for the anti-god, that unexpected intervention by the Creator might disrupt the demonic plan. Subsequently, several monads were also abducted - a kind of "reserve," or, if one may put it that way, candidates for Antichrists. In historical perspective, the fiercest battles emerged between them - victory going to the strongest and most successful, and the concentration of demonic work specifically on them.

The shells whose monads were abducted did indeed lose the ability to be born anywhere. They remain, as it were, walled up in the depths of Gashsharva to this day. And the abducted monads, burdened with material coverings made of agyi, as if bound by the hands and directly directed by Gagtung, moved along the path of demonic perfection, incarnating in humanity from century to century.

Soon, one of them, namely the former Monad of the Emperor, began to surpass the others. Her abductor led her from incarnation to incarnation, overcoming her resistance and finally achieving almost complete extinction of her bright will. During the incarnation of this remarkable being in the fifteenth century, it was found that the Monad as an autonomous force was completely paralyzed, and the material coverings created for her increasingly obeyed demonic inspiration. Although they are still far from realizing all the possibilities inherent in them. This incarnation coincided with the culmination of the meta-historical struggle of the Roman Catholic metaculture. It was associated with one of the most obvious, dramatic and terrifying attempts of Haggungra to capture the Church from within - an attempt that remains historically the last to this day. I have already mentioned elsewhere that behind the extreme current in Catholicism, which was clouded by the end of the Middle Ages and which found its most complete expression in the institution of the Inquisition, there was one of Haggungra's most horrific offspring, and the struggle against him by the forces of Light ended in victory only in the eighteenth century. As for the diabolical machinery, it appeared on the historical stage earlier, outwardly acquiring the appearance of an active fighter for universal theocracy. In Russian literature, there is a remarkable creation, the author of which undoubtedly could not but possess spiritual knowledge of this event, although this knowledge did not become fully available to his waking ego. I mean "The Legend of the Grand Inquisitor". The one who was to become the Antichrist in the not-too-distant present was, so to speak, caught by Dostoevsky by the hand at one of the most important stages of his pre-existence. However, this historical figure did not leave a loud name behind: it is now known only to medieval specialists as the name of one of the quite notable figures of the Spanish Inquisition at that time. At about the same time, Haggungra began to realize the failure of his overall attempt to turn historical Catholicism into his servant, and the impossibility of uniting the whole world on the basis of Roman cosmopolitan theocracy. Absolute tyranny was impossible without the unification of humanity, but there were still many necessary prerequisites for this unification on any basis.

I will address some of the most important meta-historical collisions that have taken place over the past centuries in other places. As Jesus Christ predicted, this course of development has led to the proximity of a decisive battle, inevitable due to the innate aggressiveness of the demonic element and its aspiration towards universal tyranny. The universal power of Him who was Jesus Christ has increased immeasurably over these centuries. If He appeared again in Enroth now, before the miracles He could perform, all the miracles of the Gospel, all the miracles of Indian and Arab legends would fade. But this is not necessary yet. His second coming is still two or three centuries away, and during this time He will be able to achieve such power as to accomplish the greatest act of history and meta-history - the changing of eons. The changing of eons will be a qualitative change in the materiality of humanity, the birth of all synclites of metaculture in enlightened physical bodies here, in Enroth, the entry of those who will make up demon-humanity on a long path of redemption in other layers, and the advent of the thousand-year kingdom of the righteous in Enroth, as it is called in the Sacred Tradition. The act of the second coming must be performed simultaneously in many points of earthly Enroth, so that not a single creature remains without seeing and hearing Him. In other words, the Planetary Logos must achieve such unimaginable power as to appear simultaneously in as many forms as there will be perceiving consciousness in Enroth at that time. However, these ethereal-physical forms will remain only brief expressions of His unique Image, and they will merge with Him for permanent residence in enlightened Enroth. This is precisely what Christ's prophecy about His second coming speaks of, which will be like lightning shining from the east to the west, so that all peoples and countries of the earth may see the Coming One on the clouds of heaven.

### Chapter 3. Femininity

I am approaching the decisive thesis. And yet, as important as it may be, I dare not say a few words about it.
For almost two thousand years, there has been a dogma of Christian doctrine that we now have to touch upon. Various dogmas of the Creed have been questioned, and different interpretations have given rise to schisms, sects, and heresies. Even the slightest ritual differences sometimes turned into a real chasm, separating schismatics from the dominant church. But over the past nineteen centuries, there seems to have been no disagreement about what was considered the foundation of all foundations: the three hypostases of the Holy Trinity - God the Father, God the Son, and God the Holy Spirit.

I do not want to subject the emergence of this understanding of the Trinity in the Christian church to historical or psychological analysis. I do not have the necessary materials or the erudition required for this. And even if I possessed both, I would be afraid to touch with the scalpel of rational analysis the most mysterious spiritual depths where this idea arose and was determined in the first centuries after Christ.

I would like to remind of one page of evangelical history, which, as it seems to me, points not towards such an understanding of the mystery of the Trinity, but towards another. The canonical Gospels (of Matthew and Luke) clearly and distinctly assert that the conception of the Infant Jesus by the Holy Spirit occurred through the Virgin Mary. Thus, it can be concluded that it was not God the Father who was the Father of Christ as a human, but the Holy Spirit. But how can this be? Could the eternal birth of God the Son from God the Father be expressed mysteriously in the historical, human world in no other way than by the birth of the human Jesus from the forces of the same hypostasis? However, the gospel account is quite clear. What is unclear is the church's understanding of the third hypostasis. Throughout the history of the church, the dogma of the third hypostasis has never been fully developed. The contrast between the most detailed development of the doctrine of God the Son and the almost empty space that is dogmatic formulas about the Holy Spirit is striking. But there is nothing strange here, in fact. It is no coincidence that Christianity itself was called precisely Christian: in addition to indicating its origin from Christ, this name reflected the fact that this religion is the revelation of God the Son above all, that is, not so much a Trinity religion as a Son religion. Hence, this excessively vague generality, ambiguity, incompleteness, and sometimes inconsistency in the dogmas concerning other hypostases.

After all, who else can be God the Father if not the Spirit? Only the Spirit. And moreover, specifically the Holy Spirit, in contrast to all other spirits created by Him, because each of the God-created and even God-born monads can make - and many have made - a negative choice, apostasy; but the Father - obviously - cannot fall away from Himself. He is primary, unchanging, pure and unclouded, and is called Holy precisely in this sense. What positive content can be attributed to the abstraction from God the Father of two properties initially inherent in Him - His spirituality and His holiness? What is the basis for attributing this abstraction an entirely autonomous significance as the third person of the Trinity? In general, why, on what words of Christ, on what testimony of the four gospels, can one base the teaching that God the Father is one hypostasis of the Trinity, and the Holy Spirit is another? There are no indications of this in the gospels. The words of Jesus cited as justification are His famous prophecy: "I will send you the Comforter, who will guide you into all truth." Different interpretations of these words even gave rise to the Great Schism, which split the Christian Church into Eastern and Western halves; but both interpretations proceeded from the common postulate: from the undisputed, for some reason by no one challenged position, that here Jesus means by the Comforter specifically the third hypostasis. But there is no hint in these words that the Comforter, whom the Risen Savior will send, is a third hypostasis, or a hypostasis at all. There is no indication here that the expressions "Comforter Spirit" and "Holy Spirit of God" should be understood as meaning the same thing. Isn't it more natural, consistent, and understandable from all points of view to adopt a completely different solution: namely, the solution that the Holy Spirit of God is precisely God the Father, because God the Father cannot be anyone other than Holy and Spirit?

Once again, I am touching upon the roots of a great teaching here, opposing a lone voice to such a powerful, vast choir that has been resounding for centuries, such that there can be no doubt about the nature of the responses to it, even if someone were to hear it. I even understand that in the eyes of some, I will be guilty of a great spiritual crime and will be attributed the one unforgivable (according to the Gospel) sin: blasphemy against the Holy Spirit. I declare solemnly that I worship the Holy Spirit, honor Him, and pray to Him with the same reverence as other Christians; and I cannot commit not only blasphemy against Him, but even the slightest diminution of His image in the idea that He is God the Father and that God the Father is the Holy Spirit - that these are two names for the same person - the first person of the Holy Trinity. And I emphasize that I express here my personal opinion, not claiming anything. True, this opinion seems to me to be a conclusion that many will have to come to over time. It was confirmed by the highest authority, which remains the only decisive authority for me. But I believe that no one is authorized to insist on the sole and absolute correctness of this idea, on its dogmatic obligation. The lawful, obvious authority empowered to resolve such a question could be the Eighth Ecumenical Council, where representatives of all existing Christian denominations and the Rose of the World would discuss this thesis, as well as the thesis on the absolute truth and irrevocability of the decisions of the ecumenical councils in general, and perhaps revise some points of Orthodox dogma. Until then, no one in the Rose of the World can claim the complete incorrectness of the old dogma: one can only believe as conscience and one's own spiritual experience dictate and work for the reunification of churches, for the resolution of all misunderstandings. However, the idea expressed here opens the way to solving another no less fundamental problem.

It is known that from the Gnostics to Christian thinkers of the early 20th century, Christianity had a vague but fervent and persistent sense of the World Feminine Principle, the feeling that this Principle is not an illusion or a projection of human categories onto the cosmic plane, but the highest spiritual reality. The Church apparently intended to give expression to this feeling by sanctifying the cult of the Mother of God in the East and the cult of the Madonna in the West, using its authority. Indeed, before the reverent worship of the Mother Principle - a worship that is irrationally innate to the masses - a concrete image emerged, towards which it was directed. However, the mystical feeling I am talking about - the feeling of the Eternal Feminine as the beginning of the cosmic and divine - remained unsatisfied. The early and undisputed dogmatization of the teaching about hypostases put the carriers of this feeling in a peculiar position: in order not to fall into heresy, they were forced to avoid the root question, not to speak to the end, sometimes identifying the World Feminine Principle with the Universal Church or, finally, to abstract one of the attributes of the Godhead - His Wisdom - and personify this abstraction by calling it Holy Sophia. The highest ecclesiastical authorities avoided expressing themselves on this issue in any way, and this cannot be blamed on them, because the idea of the World Feminine Principle cannot but transcend into the idea of the Feminine aspect of the Godhead, which naturally threatens to break the dogmatized notions of the Persons of the Holy Trinity.^^1

____________
^^1: It would be extremely interesting to see a comprehensive study on the history and development of the idea of the Eternal Feminine, at least in Christian cultures. But of course, such a study would greatly benefit from including other religions, at least those in whose pantheons the images of great merciful goddesses have been outlined: Hinduism, Mahayana, ancient polytheistic teachings, and, of course, Gnosticism.

I have met many people who were culturally and intellectually refined, possessing undeniable spiritual experience, but who were surprised and even offended by the very principle of transferring, as they believed, differences of gender and human categories to the highest realms of reality and even to the mystery of God himself. To them, this seemed like a consequence of the ancient tendency to anthropomorphize spiritual spheres with our limited human consciousness. By very similar (psychological) sources, by the way, stems the protest of strict Muslim monotheism against the idea of the Trinity and against the cult of the Mother of God. And for the same reason, deism and modern abstract cosmopolitan monism are so intolerant of beliefs in the Trinity, in hierarchies, and, of course, in the idea of the Eternal Feminine. Ironically, even the accusation of polytheism, thrown at Christianity by Muhammad 1,300 years ago, is repeated.

Such accusations are based on either too simplified understanding of Christian ideas or unwillingness to delve into the depth of the question. In neither historical Christianity nor in this concept is there any transfer of human categories to the Godhead, but there is something fundamentally opposite. The unity of God is not questioned by anyone, of course; it would be naive to seek a return to the times of Carthage, Ur, or Heliopolis here. Hypostases are different manifestations of the One Essence outwardly; it is how it is revealed to the world, not how it abides in itself. But outward manifestations are as absolutely real as abiding in itself; therefore, hypostases cannot be accepted as illusions or aberrations of our consciousness in any case.

As it manifests outward, the Unity reveals a certain inherent polarity. The essence of this polarity within the Godhead is transcendent to us. However, as it manifests outward, it is perceived by us as the polarity of two mutually attracting and interdependent principles, eternally and perpetually united in creative love and giving rise to the third and completing principle: the Son, the Foundation of the Universe, the Logos. Flowing into the universe, divinity maintains this inherent polarity, permeating all spirituality and materiality of the universe. At different stages of being, it is expressed differently. In the layer of inorganic matter, which is accessible to universal human perception, it can be seen, perhaps, in the basis of what we call the universal law of gravity, in the polarity of electricity, and in many other things. In the organic matter of our layer, here, the polarity of the Divine is manifested in the opposite nature of the masculine and feminine principles. I repeat and emphasize: here, because the polarity of the Godhead underlying this opposite nature cannot be understood in itself, in its essence.

That is why we call the Divine Feminine the Mother of the Logos and through Him, the entire universe. But the eternal union between the Father and the Mother does not change Her eternal essence; that is precisely why we call the Mother of the Worlds the Ever-Virgin.

Thus, in the doctrine of the Trinity and the Feminine aspect of the Godhead, there is not the transfer of the "too human" to the upper spheres, but, on the contrary, the understanding of the objective polarity of our layers - male and female principles - as a projection of the incomprehensible polarity in the essence of God. "God is love," said John. Ages will change, then zones, finally Brahmas and galaxies; each of us, sooner or later, will reach the Pleroma - the divine Fullness, and will enter the maternal womb not only as a child, but also as a brother of God; our present ideas about the Godhead will disappear from memory, like pale, faded, unnecessary shadows, but even then the truth that God is love will not lose its truth. God loves not Himself (such an assumption would be sacrilegious), but each of the Incomprehensibilities concealed in Him is turned by love towards another, and in this love the Third is born: the Foundation of the Universe. The Father - Ever-Virgin-Mother - Son.

The highest of mysteries, the inner mystery of the Godhead, the mystery of the love of the Father and Mother, is by no means "reflected" in human love, whatever it may be: nothing in the finite world can be commensurate or similar to the essence of this mystery. But nothing in the world, except for what comes from the apostate principles, can be indifferent to this mystery. In human love in general, that is, in love for all living things, the essence of the Triune, which is love, is expressed (not reflected). In the love of men and women, the internal mystery of the union of the Father and Mother is expressed (not reflected) to the extent that it reaches us, being refracted by a multitude of layers of the cosmic series. And therein lies the fundamental, ontological difference between the two areas of our spiritual life, which have almost nothing in common with each other, but are expressed in our poor language by the same word.

Love for all living beings has long been a religious foundation, if not in practice, then in idea, and not only in Christianity. We can expect an even greater expansion of what is encompassed by love in the future. However, in the non-religious teachings of modern times, there is a clear retreat from love in an extremely narrow sense: towards one's state collective, its allies and supporters abroad, towards one's family and friends, and only towards them. But this phenomenon is strictly temporary, conditioned by the nature of the non-religious era with its limited and reduced morality, and its duration is the same as that of the entire non-religious stage of development. The next religious era will be new precisely because it will proclaim and strive to realize the love of all humanity, all the kingdoms of Nature, and all the ascending hierarchies.^^2 In the distant future, even greater spiritual possibilities will be revealed. Love for demons will become accessible and necessary. Some of the saints in the past already elevated themselves to such love. But to surpass oneself, to cultivate in one's soul, which is not yet free from temptations, which has not yet embraced love even for humanity and the animal kingdom, love for the true enemies of God and all living beings, means to endanger the ascending path of one's own soul. Demons are just waiting to be pitied. But they wait, of course, not because they need this pity (they are obsessed with pride and despise human pity), but because such pity towards them is one step towards doubting their wrongdoing, and from such doubt, it is easy to fall into the temptation of blasphemy and rebellion. Rebellion, in turn, predetermines the soul's subjection to cruel retribution and the generation of emissions of suffering, Gehenna, in exactly the abundance that demons dream of to maintain their life force. Therefore, love for demons is highly dangerous for anyone except for an already enlightened soul. An enlightened soul will understand on its own how to love without experiencing either sympathy (because sympathy for anyone is impossible without sympathy for their basic activity, and the activity of demons is directed only towards evil) or rejoicing (because they rejoice only in what is contrary to Providence). This love can only be expressed in the feeling of the greatest pity, in the belief in their ultimate enlightenment, and in the readiness to give up everything except for one's loyalty to the Divine for the sake of this enlightenment.

^^2: In the chapter on the animal kingdom, there was already mention of the only exception - the class of living beings that cannot and should not be circumscribed by love in the conditions of the current zone: parasites. Here we face an ethical problem that we are not able to resolve at this stage of our ascent. We should not harbor any illusions about this.

But love for all living things is practically only one side of the problem. What about the other side of our lives - both external and internal - which includes everything called love between a man and a woman?

The "glowing coal" inside every being, the relentless instinct of reproduction, the source of self-sacrifice, wild passions, pure inspirations, crimes, heroic deeds, vices and suicides - is it strange that for ascetics and saints, this love was the greatest stumbling block? They tried to distinguish the duality within it: opposing physical love to platonic, fleeting passion to unchanging love, free relationships to the labor and duty of childbearing, debauchery to romantic infatuation. Sometimes they distinguished the duality of the transphysical sources of love: Uranian Aphrodite and Common Aphrodite. But in concrete reality, in living feeling, in everyday relationships, everything was intertwined, entangled, transitioning from one to the other, condensed into a knot that cannot be untied; it begins to seem that it is better to uproot the very roots of this love than to block the path to heaven with its wild overgrowth.

Thus began the great ascetic era in religion. There is no need, I think, to repeat the truths about the deals Christianity and Buddhism had to make with their own spirits in order not to degenerate into ascetic sects, hating life and themselves hated by it. Marriage was sanctified by the sacrament, childbearing blessed, but the highest state continued to be considered - and completely consistently - monasticism.

The peculiarity of love as a source of various human tragedies lies in the fact that love can be one-sided. Love will not lose this characteristic for a long time, until the second zone. But in addition to tragedies of this kind, if one can put it that way - primary tragedies, humanity, striving to normalize its complicated life, has created prerequisites for other tragedies: they occur when the love of two people conflicts with established customs, social views, or state law. When a man or a woman loves, but does not receive reciprocity, this is a tragedy of the first type, and nothing can be done about it until humanity, as Dostoevsky said, "changes physically." When both love each other, but their comprehensive and harmonious connection, untainted by anything, cannot be realized due to the family or social status of one of them, this is a tragedy of the second type; customs and legislation must be restructured over time to reduce these tragedies to a minimum, if not to zero.

This is an enormously complex task. It is unlikely that a single system of laws in this area can be developed for all of humanity: the level of social and cultural development, traditions, and national psychology are too different. It will not be the central legislative body of the Rose of the World, but probably its legislative bodies in individual countries that will have to deal with this. It is also quite clear that society will have to be led, as in everything else, through a series of successive stages, because a unilaterally negative solution to the problem, that is, a sudden cancellation of legal restrictions, leads, as experience has shown in Russia, to moral anarchy, forcing the state to cancel the cancellations and restore the prohibitions. This is because the cancellations were made mechanically, without prior education in generations of such a view of marriage and love, which is necessary to be able to use such broad freedom.

It is thought that the correct religious answer to the question of love between a man and a woman can only be one: this love is blessed, beautiful, and holy to the extent that this love is creative.

What does this mean?

It means that the most common form of creative love in our sphere is the birth and upbringing of children, but this is by no means the only form of creative love and love creativity. Joint work in any field of culture, nurturing the best sides of each other's personalities, mutual self-improvement, inspiring each other in artistic, religious, and any other creative work, finally, even the simple happiness of young, fresh, passionate love, enriching, strengthening and uplifting both - all this is divinity because it leads to their growth and enlightenment, to the expansion of the world ocean of love and joy. The radiance of beautiful love between a man and a woman rises to the highest worlds, strengthening them - to the worlds that were characterized in one of the previous chapters as Waves of World Femininity. Even if both lovers direct their joint creative work in the wrong direction, for example, if both of them work in a direction that has socially harmful meaning - even in this case, only the direction of this work deserves condemnation; the impulse of co-creation, with which their love is marked, the spirit of companionship, companionship, and friendship with which it is imbued, is blessed from above.

Until humanity is physically transformed, love between a man and a woman will remain attached to the instinct of physical reproduction. Over time, this will change. The creativity of love will change its content. The concept of physical reproduction will become irrelevant to the transformed humanity. Then the embodiment of monads in enlightened bodies will take place, realized in a completely different way. But, of course, in the conditions of our zone, the main form of creative love remains the birth of children and their upbringing.

The chapters at the end of the book are dedicated to the problem of upbringing. Here, I think it is timely to note some of the peculiarities of the historical tasks that the current cycle of epochs sets before women, not only in upbringing but also in life in general.

Both men and some women who lack a deep understanding of the feminine principle sometimes make a decisive statement that cultural and creative tasks for both genders are the same. And if up to now, in society, politics, science, technology, philosophy, and even in art, women have lagged behind men in the volume and significance of what they create, it is only because women have always been in a subordinate and oppressed position. Such an opinion is more widespread than one might think. It is even permissible to call it prevalent.

However, was a woman always and everywhere in an oppressed position? For two hundred years in Europe and Russia, the doors of creative work in literature and art have been open - of course, in privileged classes - to women as well as men. Do we need to remind that, despite showing undeniable talent and producing a considerable number of musicians and performers, women over these two centuries (as well as throughout the entire preceding period of world history) have not enriched the pantheon of musical geniuses with a single name? It is sad that we have to point out that among the world's literary greats, for every two or three hundred male names, there are only six or seven female names. Almost a century ago, women gained the right to higher education in many countries. And she successfully replaced men in many areas of professional activity: in hospitals, laboratories, school chairs, even sometimes in scientific expeditions. But where are the hundreds of names of outstanding women scientists who could balance the hundreds of male names that became known worldwide during the same period of time? The world theater shines like a starry sky with the names of remarkable actresses. But has any female director truly gained worldwide fame? Has anyone heard of a woman - a great philosopher? a great architect? a great statesman? a famous metallurgist, wise critic, remarkable production organizer, or celebrated chess player? To deny or ignore these facts is to sign up for complete lack of objectivity. Instead of denying the facts, it would be more productive to change the perspective on them. Is a woman less talented than a man? It is absolutely undeniable that in some respects - yes. And it is equally undeniable that in other respects, she possesses gifts that a man does not have and never will.

Of course, it would be a reactionary absurdity to deny that a woman can be a good geologist, a conscientious engineer, a talented artist, a qualified chemist or biologist, or to doubt the usefulness or value of her work in these fields. But two indisputable facts can and should be recognized: first, that the list of brilliant figures in these fields has not been enriched by, and is unlikely to ever be enriched by, female names, and secondly, that a woman is indispensable and highly gifted in another area.

Creativity of love. And finally, the creative fertilization of the soul of the one she loves. That is where a woman is indispensable and boundlessly gifted.

In the first and last of these forms of creativity, she is absolutely indispensable. In the others, a man yields to her to the extent that she yields to him in the field of statecraft or technical sciences. For here, it is precisely the feminine, womanly spiritual quality that is required: softness, loving tenderness, selflessness, patient perseverance, carefulness, sensitivity, heartiness, attentiveness.

In the fields of high creativity, the opposite of what we see in the physical world occurs: there, the fertilizing element is the woman, and the man shapes and embodies it. "The Divine Comedy" is the fruit of two people, and without Beatrice, it would not have appeared in the world, just as it would not have without Dante. And if we delved into the depths of the creative process of most great artists, we would be convinced that the spiritual seed of their immortal creations was sown by a woman into the depths of their subconscious, into secret creative sanctuaries. The idea of erecting a monument to Ulrike Levenzof in Weimar, who inspired Goethe's beautiful poetry, is fair and profound. And there is no need to be embarrassed that in most artists' biographies, it is difficult to find by external means the female names that deserve the gratitude of future generations to the same extent as the names of the artists themselves: the artists themselves sometimes do not know to whom they owe the seeds of their creations. Each of them will find out in their own time and place, already beyond Enroth.

For thousands of years, there has been an excess of the masculine, masculine element in humanity: strength, audacity, pride, courage, the desire to move forward, cruelty, militarism. There is a Spanish proverb that depresses the consciousness and offends the conscience: "A man must be ferocious." Alas, the people who created this proverb have fully justified it. The inhumanity of the conquistadors and the atrocities of the Spanish Inquisition decorated the pages of the world's peaceful history with pictures of such ferocity that the evil emanating from them continues to affect souls to this day.

However, many other nations were not far behind the Spaniards in this regard. Waves of wars, uprisings, revolutions, terror, and brutal retributions have rolled and continue to roll across the face of the earth, millennium after millennium, composed of countless drops that make up these waves - men's wills and men's hearts. Female cruelty is sometimes spoken of, but, my God, did the bloodshed of Genghis Khans, Timurs, Napoleons, the torture of Zastenkov, the fury of the Jacobin terror, the frenzy of colonial conquests, the mass repressions of fascist and other dictatorships begin and be led by women? History knows of female poisoners, fratricides, infanticides, and sadistic women, but it knows of none whose historical significance is comparable to that of Tiberius and Nero, Assarhaddon and Allah ed-Din, Torquemada and Pizarro, Duke of Alba and Robespierre. Neither of the fearsome Skuratovs, Himmlers and Berias.

The timid, cornered feminine principle was spared destruction only because without it the male himself is as sterile as lead, and because there can be no physical continuation of humanity without a woman.

Until now, it has been proclaimed that not only men but also women must be brave. If courage is understood as courage and resilience in the struggle for life, then, of course, this is true. But if femininity is understood not as a style of manners and behavior, not as coquetry and sentimentality, but as a combination of heartwarming tenderness, inner elegance, and the ability to sacrifice oneself daily for those you love, then not only women but also men should be feminine.

When humanity finally reaches an era in which falsely understood masculinity will no longer turn a man into a ferocious conqueror, a braggart brawler who flaunts his crudeness, a mixture of a turkey and a tiger, when he will no longer be raised with false shame before his own suppressed tenderness, trampled and violated by himself, it will be difficult to overcome this millennia-old complex of prejudices, biases, mental scars, and atavistic instincts, but they must be overcome. At all costs.

In the metahistory of modern times, the most mysterious event is taking place: the descent into our universe of new divine-creative forces. The hearts of the most elevated and the minds of the most refined have dreamed of this event since ancient times. And now it is happening. The first link in this event - an event of such significance that it can only be compared to the incarnation of the Planetary Logos - took place at the turn of the 19th century: it was the descent of the forces of the Ever-Virgin Mother, but not impersonal, as it had occurred twice before in human history, and infinitely strengthened by its personal nature. From the heights of the Universe, the great god-born Monad descended into Shadanakar. The vision in Raoris - one of the highest levels of our universe, into which She entered then - was given almost a century later to Vladimir Solovyov when, on a starry night in the Egyptian desert, he experienced a breathtaking breakthrough of consciousness and saw this Great Feminine Being in person. We call Her the Zventa-Sventana, the expression of the Feminine hypostasis of the Trinity. Her dwelling place now is in Bayushmi, in one of the spheres belonging to the Sakual of the Waves of the World Femininity. The day of Her long-awaited descent into one of the supreme cities of metaculture is approaching. There She must be born in a body of enlightened ether - the child of the demiurge and one of the Great Sisters. A host of the highest souls will descend with Her into this enclave of the Elite of Shadanakar. Here She is, our hope and our expectation, Light and Divine Beauty! For this birth will be reflected in our history as seen by our grandchildren and great-grandchildren: as the foundation of the Rose of the World, its spread through the human circles of all countries, and, if the terrible failure of humanity does not cast it down into the depths of darkness, the coming of the Rose of the World to supreme power over the whole earth.

Oh, this does not yet mean the final victory of the forces of Light: let us remember the Horsemen of the Apocalypse! Only the sequence of the Horsemen in history is not the one predicted by the prophet on the island of Patmos: first came the Black - the era of the dominance of theocracy on a feudal basis. Now the second Horseman completes his path, the Red one: everyone will understand what is hidden behind this symbol. We await and hope for the arrival of the White Horseman - the Rose of Peace, the golden age of humanity! The appearance of the last Horseman, the Pale one, will not prevent anything: Gagtungur will achieve the birth in human form of the one he has cherished for so many centuries. But the era of the dominance of the Rose of Peace will bring about such a reduction in spiritual sacrifices that cannot be counted. It will be able to raise generations of refined character. It will strengthen the power of the spirit in millions, even billions, of wavering souls. Warning of the approaching Antichrist, and when he appears - pointing him out and exposing him, instilling unshakable faith in human hearts, and understanding of meta-historical perspectives and world spiritual panoramas in the mind, it will make the temptations of the coming darkness inaccessible to generations to come.

And not only will the Rose of the World reflect in Enrof the mystery of the birth of Zventa-Sventana ^^3 in one of its bays; the increase of feminine forces and their importance in modern times is reflected everywhere. This is primarily what determines the universal aspiration for peace, the aversion to bloodshed, disillusionment with violent methods of transformation, the increasing social importance of women, the growing tenderness and care for children, the burning thirst for beauty and love. We are entering a cycle of epochs in which the feminine soul will become purer and wider; when an increasing number of women will become deep inspirers, sensitive mothers, wise leaders, far-sighted directors of people. It will be a cycle of epochs when the feminine in humanity will manifest itself with unprecedented power, balancing the self-will of masculine principles to perfect harmony. Let those who have eyes to see, see.

^^3: As I have already mentioned, the phonetics of Enrof cannot accurately reflect the sound of words in the language of the Synclite of the World: each such word possesses a kind of chord of sounds, a chord of meanings, and is accompanied, in addition, by light phenomena. The approximate meaning of the name Zventa-Sventana is "The Brightest of the Bright and the Holiest of the Holy". The root of the name is Slavic, since the zatomis in which Her birth takes place is associated primarily with Slavic peoples.

## Book VII. On the Meta-History of Ancient Rus'

### Chapter 1. Kiev Rus' as a Meta-Historical Phenomenon

As I have already mentioned, the term "supranational" refers to a group of nations or nationalities united by a shared, jointly created culture that is physiognomically distinct from others. Ethnicity is not relevant in this context. It is enough to recall cases where one nation immediately stood out as the leading one among the nations that make up the supranation (for example, ancient Egypt; the subordinate nationalities belonging to a different ethnic root were the peoples of Nubia, Napata, and Meroe), as well as cases that were opposite: several ethnically diverse nations came together to form a single supranation, passing on the leading role to each other in different eras or sharing it among themselves (Indian, Northwest, Far Eastern, Roman Catholic supranations).

Coinciding mainly with the centuries-old outlines of Russia, our people belong more to the formations of the first type. The polyethnic origin of the Russian nation does not contradict this: what is important is that throughout its history, the leading role in the supranation, the global role, has remained with it, not passing to Ukrainians, Belarusians, or the peoples of the Volga region or Siberia. Emerging from diverse ethnic elements, like the people of Egypt once did, the Russian nation has become, like it, the strongest creative force among the smaller nations that have come together with it in a single culture. (This refers to the past and present. It is not excluded that the situation may change in the future.)

This great education of the last millennium was long ago predetermined by the creative intent of the ethnocentric hierarchies - the Russian demiurge and Navna, - an intent that arose in their consciousness as a vague dream, as a form that restrained their will. This was the case once in Rangarajadra, the homeland of the demiurges and the Great Sisters. Oh, Yarosvet then did not at all resemble the "spirit of snow and flame": it was a joyful, sunny child, not yet having acquired the wisdom of Shadanakar, and if it had a vague premonition of the vast expanse of its duty, then only in the vague outlines of grandiose prototypes. Contemplating from afar the emerging peaks of other metacultures, the creations of other demiurges and synclites, it began to realize the scale of its spirit, the proportions of its own future creation. Gradually becoming aware of its duty, it tried to approach it with its inspired boyish play; this game began to grow into a sacred act, into peacemaking, when the high spiritual person who had been an apostle Andrew the First-Called in Enroth a few centuries before gave his strength to Yarosvet. In the Demiurges' sacral, there began to emerge, as it were, a hazy outline of Heavenly Russia. Church tradition considers the apostle Andrew to be the first enlightener of our distant ancestors. This is true in the sense that in the late 1st century AD, the apostle Andrew received the crown of martyrdom in the land of Scythia. But this tradition also contains, apparently, an echo of intuitive knowledge that this spiritual person who had reached immense strength and height in the millennium between his death and his participation in Yarosvet's peacemaking act was the founding father of Heavenly Russia.

His duty, which consisted of marrying the Cathedral Soul of the people and giving birth to Zventy-Sventana with her, was already understood by the demiurge Yarosvet, but the preparation for this could not yet be represented to him in the forms and temporal scales that it actually took. He did not anticipate that one of his own creations would fatally rise up against him and become his greatest metahistorical rival, usurper, and distorter of his design. He could not foresee that the constant struggle of hostile hierarchies against him and Navna would become the content of Russia's metahistorical drama from the 11th to the 21st century. Finally, it could not be clear to him that for the realization of his mission, huge processes must also be completed within the womb of other cultures, because only with the union of all humanity into a single socio-political whole is the gradual transformation of this whole into a universal brotherhood possible.

The time of Navna's descent into the four-dimensional layers came a little earlier, when Yarosvet was still absorbing the creative emanations of the Planetary Logos in Rangaraidre. Below, the boundless empty spaces of the four-dimensional sakual stretched out. In the distance, to the east and south, were rising the building masses of other, senior metacultures. To the west, a misty, slowly crystallizing structure had already emerged, crowned with the peak of dazzling whiteness - the mystical Monsalvat of Germany, England, Burgundy, and Scandinavia. To the south, the Byzantine Zatomis trembled and shimmered with gold and purple, and it seemed that it was already ready to break away from the earth and rise, like a glittering ark, to the foot of the heavenly abode of Christ. But the vast space open to the Arctic Ocean was barren. Only transparent clouds of raging stihials swept there, over untraveled forests and giant Enrofa rivers, and weak thickenings of tribal egregors pulsed here and there, intensifying on the open steppes of the south.

Of course, the picture I have sketched should not be taken literally. It is only a hint, a poetic generalization that greatly simplifies the true picture of many sakuals that opened before the eyes of the descending Navna. But all of them were connected with the only region of the ancient Eurasian continent that still remained free from any influence of the great civilizations of mankind.

Scanty material remains of several disappeared tribal groups, which never created either a nation or a written culture, rested in the soil without disturbing its primary virgin purity. The forests and steppes of future European Russia seemed quite capacious for the settlement of vast human masses in the future, while to the east, there was still another inexhaustible spatial reserve stretching to the Pacific Ocean. The reserves of all kinds of minerals could provide the material basis of life for a colossal collective for millennia to come.

The centers of great senior cultures were distant enough to preserve the young culture of the future from losing itself until the task of overcoming the border vacuums could become within the reach of its own growing genius. Only the demiurge of Byzantium was still working nearby on his tragic work that was tearing him away from the ground, preparing to pass on to Yarosvet the burden of tasks doomed to remain unfinished.

It was not a country but a whole part of the world, and the anticipation of events commensurate with its scale could take one's breath away - not only human breath.

The meaning of Navna's descent or second birth in Shadanakar was that she gradually began to clothe herself in the material fabrics of that four-dimensional layer, where the demiurge and great human spirits, giving him their powers, began to lay the material (not physical, of course, but etheric) foundations of Heavenly Rus. From this time, apparently corresponding to the 8th-9th centuries of our era, a slow process began to form an East Slavic tribal unity in the historical plan.

If we wanted, by analogy with the phenomena of human life, to determine the meta-ethereal age of Navna in that historical epoch, we would have to stop at the one which we are accustomed to identifying with the transition from childhood to youth.^^1 Mother Earth nurtured her, and the souls of the stihials, harsh and gentle, one after another entered into the created zatomis of Holy Russia and clothed the flowing substance of Navna with their flowing fabrics. In those times, the state of Navna was marked by the unity of the original harmony, the immediate joy of the first taste of embodiment. The feminine-material premonition of future storms was softened by memories of the celestial homeland, Rangarajdre, and the expectation of a brother, friend, and fiancé from there. And in Heavenly Russia and in earthly Russia, his distant but unwavering gaze was felt everywhere. And if Navna herself was barely beginning to understand the vague reflections of the surrounding stihials in the popular consciousness, then the Demiurge's reason clarified, outlined, defined, crystallized them in the names of Slavic deities: Perun, Yarilo, Stribog, Lada.

In the language of historians, this cross-influence of the Demiurge and the Ideal Cathedral Soul is called mythology, religion, art, and the way of life of the ancient Slavs - all that is now embraced by the concepts of spiritual and material culture.

____________
^^1: I note that age stages applied to hierarchies of a super-nation not only have a duration many times greater than that of the corresponding stages of human life but also the proportions of these stages do not coincide with those familiar to us. In particular, their youth is synchronous with very long periods of history, and their maturity period predominantly takes place when the corresponding nation has played its role in Enroth and continues to develop and create in the higher layers of metaculture. For example, the national leadership hierarchies of Ancient Egypt, Babylon, antiquity, not to mention Gondwana and Atlantis, are currently in a state of complete maturity.

The event, which in the anthropomorphic cipher of our concepts can be marked as the first appearance of Yarosvet in the flesh in Heavenly Russia and his meeting with Navna there, took place in the 10th century. The storm caused by this in the meta-historical world is difficult to compare, as even the very idea of a joyful storm seems artificial to us. It was a descent of meta-etheric and astral streams, similar to bubbling waterfalls of light. Demiurges were accompanied by rejoicing human spirits descending from Iroln or flowing in from other meta-cultures – those who were to be later embodied on Russian soil with invisible crowns of lineage, righteous people, geniuses, and heroes. The Stihials welcomed Yarosvet as a messenger of God and a great creator who was to create something among them, over them, and with them that went beyond their understanding, but inspired their material souls with incomprehensible reverence and delight. Navna received him in the blessed forest expanses of Holy Russia as a long-awaited bridegroom.

Through certain mysteries and rituals of our religions, such as the mystery of marriage, which is familiar in one form or another to all peoples, we create resemblances to events in the lives of nation-building hierarchies. However, such a mystery between Yarosvet and Navna then still flickered only from the distant future, although it seemed to them that the joy of their meeting was the mystery of marriage. In reality, after this meeting, another event took place, another mystery, parallel to which only the Christian cult in humanity possesses, which has made the sacrament of communion its axis.

This was their communion with God the Son, crucified while the demonic element still exists in the universe, in Worldly matter, which is animated by Him – in that living flesh, the mystical sign of which we take bread and wine. It took place not in Heavenly Russia, which was not yet ready for it at that time, but in the great Byzantine hinterland. From there, the Byzantine demiurge opened the ranks of the heavens over this hinterland; Yarosvet and Navna saw firsthand the ultimate height of the Christian Transmif and, through the Heavenly Jerusalem, entered into communication with God. Thus, their first meeting with the One who can only be seen face to face by God-born monads took place in Shadanakar. Thus, the Byzantine demiurge initiated them into his deepest secret – a secret that he was unable to effectively embody in the forms of human life. Now he was passing it on to them as his heirs.

The historical failure of all three Christianities, as is known, boiled down to the fact that both Catholicism and Byzantine Orthodoxy, and later Protestant churches remained only churches, and with a small letter at that. The aberration of consciousness of some members of these churches, who consider them to be a single universal mystical community, is sad and striking. This is a distortion of perspective, confusion between the expected and the given, distortion of timeframes, and even worse, a lowering and distortion of the very ideal.

In our worldview, the churches of humanity are phenomena full of originality. As peaks, they reach the foothills of the World Savior, and in Enrofe, they exist as closed volumes, relying on limited areas within culture, within statehood, within everyday life, and within the human soul.

The drama of historical Christianity is that none of the churches turned into a form of perfect national structure capable of expressing and realizing the covenant of Christianity, its mystical and ethical meaning. The reason for this lies again in the interruption of the mission of Jesus Christ by Gagtung, due to the lack of serious, sincere, and pure attempts in this direction, the fault of the churches themselves as human communities. Because if Catholicism, striving to replace the Kingdom of God on earth with an hierarchy, fell victim, although fortunately temporarily, to one of the most terrible infra-physical vampires in world history, then Orthodoxy, having taken, according to Dostoevsky, "a corner in the state" in Byzantium, completely abandoned this task. This task, one of the key if not the most key task that arose before humanity, now passed with all the immeasurable weight and danger of the path required by it to the hierarchies of Russian metaculture.

It was reflected by the mirror of historical reality in the act of the so-called baptism of Rus. To truly understand the vast scale of historical and meta-historical consequences predetermined by the action of Prince Vladimir, it is sufficient to consider what the young Russian super-ethnic group would have faced with the prospect of joining Catholicism, Islam, or, even more so, Khazar Judaism; what a distorted, almost absurd future would have been brought to life by such a choice of religion. A great monographic chapter about Prince Vladimir Svyatoslavich, a truly titanic figure, naturally suggests itself, but unfortunately goes beyond the compositional framework of this book. This scale is still underestimated due to the remoteness and obscurity of the era and the pre-dawn twilight illumination in which the figure of this statesman rises at the origins of our history. Perhaps only meta-historical contemplation and reflection can lead to a deeper understanding of the true meaning of the one whom the people revered, loved, and sang praises of for almost a thousand years, linking his name to one of the warmest and tenderest nicknames known in world history: Red Sun (a nickname that cannot be translated into other languages, as only in Russian it seems permissible to use the diminutive form for the sun). In any case, the act of the baptism of Rus was almost entirely the deed of Prince Vladimir, a deed completely providential, no matter how primitive and extraneous the motives that were activated in the reformer's consciousness.

This involvation of Yaroslavets began in the 10th century and was quickly marked by the appearance, following Vladimir, of a number of major historical figures: Yaroslav the Wise, chronicler Nestor, Antoniy and Feodosiy Pecherskiy, and then Vladimir Monomakh. These future human spirits, who descended into Heavenly Russia in the days of its foundation, were now directed by the Demiurge to Enroth to fulfill special tasks, with the missions of righteous men and genealogists.

As always, over large collectives, over the Kiev state there breathed and swayed an immaterial formation, similar to which was already spoken about in the chapter about the middle layers of Shadanakar, called egregors. Created by the psychological emanations of the people associated with state activity, the egregor possessed a semblance of consciousness, a charge of will and lived its own life, largely determining the state activity of each subsequent generation of Russian people.

It did not have its own monad and Dingra's carriage - one of the manifestations of Lilith, the last of the hierarchies, the significance of which in the emergence of the Russian people was enormous. Expanding its activities to the boundaries of the nation - and later the super-nation, whose living materiality it was called upon to continuously renew and strengthen, Dingra's carriage fulfilled its providential role, and this positive content was exhausted by it.

The sphere of activity of the Karossi is primarily delineated by the boundaries of the people's sexual life. It participates in every act of human coitus and conception. It holds the keys to the desires of representatives of both sexes. But for her, carrying within herself the cursed yetzerhare, there is an inherent desire to overflow beyond the circumference of her zone of activity, to subjugate all phenomena falling within her field of view, to engulf with waves of sexual passion other impulses of the people's soul. The phallic orgy of antiquity, now lost its religious-magical coloration, but manifested in some folk festivals, remains to this day the most vivid expression of Dingra, "The All-People's Aphrodite" of Russia. Wedding, feast, spring and similar orgiastic actions, games, and rituals in pre-Christian times arose in Russia as waves emanating from the waving of the invisible coverings of Dingra, as echoes of her heavy dance, as reflections of her fiery gaze, staring into the body of the people and into the body of each person. In Russia, Christianity, which immediately entered into open and secret struggle with the Karossi, categorically said "no" to any mysticism of gender and forced it to go underground, where it, disfigured by narrow limits, acquired a suffocating and fetid shade, ultimately leading to the heinous sin of the flagellant and other perverse sects. In some other cultures, especially in ancient cultures, the activity of the Karossi was evident on the surface of the people's lives, and the shadow of these beings clearly reached the consciousness of the myth-creating and religious-creative strata of the superpeople, turning into images of goddesses, protectresses of love, marriage, and childbirth. It is clear that in those places where such goddesses were worshipped with the admixture of an orgy, where the tasks of continuing the race gave way to an uncontrolled thirst for sensual pleasure, the influence of the Karossi was mixed and even overshadowed by the viscous and disintegrating effect of the forces of Duggur.

Activation of the forces of light always triggers the activation of the forces against the gods - this is apparently a law of the current zone in the meta-history. Could the god of opposition and its worlds remain indifferent, contemplating the emergence of new forces in the meta-historical arena that ultimately seek to overcome the demonic rule over the human world? The struggle of the infra-physical state against Navna, Yarosveta, and Dingra (the latter remaining a necessary participant in the meta-historical process despite being blind) takes on several forms.

Trace the main lines of movement, the main events of the history of Kievan Rus: everyone can easily distinguish two main factors that threatened the young national formation. Even Vladimir took the Kievan throne only after a bloody feud. As soon as he died, the whole country was shaken by the struggle for power and the fratricidal wars of Svyatopolk the Accursed. The short respite during the reign of Yaroslav the Wise was followed by a new wave of strife during the reign of Iziaslav I, and since then, a two-hundred-year-long princely strife has been interrupted only by brief years. This strife not only flooded the country's fields with blood and undermined its physical existence but also exhausted the etheric substance of the super-people and dangerously and painfully inhibited its spiritual development. Thus, the great predator, the destroyer of lights and hearthstones, the multiplier of suffering - Velega of Russia - emerges on the surface of history. In human beings, she tears down all prohibitions on the lowest instincts of destruction and defilement. She absorbs fragments of the disintegrated human etheric and astral bodies. She is the swirling center of a multitude of small infra-physical beings, the inspirer of anarchic forces, the mistress of battlefields and places of execution.

The Velgs appeared within the boundaries of Shadanakar together with the majority of other demonic monads, that is, almost from the very beginning. But for the meta-historian, another immutable fact is more important: that each Velga is a pole of the Ideal Cathedral Soul, and that it strives to pull the ethereal-astral substance of the super-race into the sphere of demonic materiality.

The second form of struggle against the Antigod and his worlds, against the bright dyad and Dingra, consisted of attempts to exterminate them or exhaust them with attacks from the outside. This goal was pursued by those events that, in the mirror of historical reality, took the form of attacks by the Pechenegs, Polovtsians, and finally the Tatars on the Kiev state torn apart by the Velga. Is it difficult to discern behind these shadows, these hordes and armies rushing through the steppe expanses of the Volga, Don, and Dnieper, those from whom these shadows are cast: the fierce egregores of the steppe peoples, forever boiling, forever seething, unable to harden into stable, creative organisms of history?

This type of hostile activity of the Antigod will grow in the distant future, endangering the existence of the country during the time of Tatar, Polish, French, and German invasions. The actions of the Velga will take the form of nationwide internal upheavals of the Great Troubles and the Great Revolution.

Despite unfavorable meta-historical conditions, Yarosvet makes attempts to showcase his youthful genius in the 11th-12th centuries. At first, the demiurge of Byzantium still guides him; the result of this in historical reality is what historians call "Byzantine influence" or "Byzantine tradition". And since any creativity in the context of a certain tradition requires less courage and spiritual insight, the actors of the tradition always outnumber the innovators. But the most important thing is that during this era, the influence of Yarosvet himself became such that it was difficult to distinguish it from the influence of Christian Transmif, as he became involved in the reality of this Transmif himself. He became involved himself - but did not become closed off in it; the side that was expressed in pre-Christian Russian culture remained untouched by this Transmif and continued to exist, albeit not with the same intensity.

The Christian myth powerfully flowed into the consciousness of the people, enchanting and attracting hearts with the images of the Almighty, the Blessed Virgin, and the saints, who had once risen to the heights of righteousness from the dark depths of Judaism and Byzantium. White rays streamed from the holy sites of Jerusalem and Athos, from the merchants of Tsargrad, warming the soul and introducing it to the joy of Orthodox creativity: monasticism, emulation of the lives of the righteous, admiration in the realm of the spirit, humility, church construction, fasting. And from there came constant warnings, trembling horror before the worlds of retribution, all the more frightening because the weight of posthumous retribution was not softened by any purgatories in the Byzantine metaculture.

The ancient Slavic worldview has retreated to the remote corners of culture, to the lower classes and peasants. However, the great forests have reliably preserved the connection between human beings and the elements in their depths, and the wizardry of the volkhvs, performances in honor of creative forces, the spells of the witches, and the rituals that bind humans to the unseen inhabitants and owners of nature continued to exist. Demanding asceticism never became a guiding principle for the masses in world history; it did not happen here either. Life demanded the same things: continuation of the family line, protection of the family, and defense of the country against the attacks of nomadic steppe peoples. No matter how much the monks prayed in monasteries, these prayers did not relieve the masses of their military duty, daily labor, fatal Polovtsian raids, and the joys of passionate, full-blooded life that rewarded them for everything. Thus, the foundations of dual faith were laid, which did not disappear in Russia until the 20th century.

The first monument of the inspiration of the hierarchy of the super-people that has come down to us is "The Tale of Igor's Campaign" - a work that is not at all related to the Byzantine tradition or with the transformation of Christianity in general. In the foreign asceticism and humility, the brave intonations of the poem, similar to the clear and pure ringing of steel, in the reflections of non-Christian beliefs, flaring up here and there on its harsh horizon, even in the very theme of this monument - in the armed struggle against the national enemy - there is a direct inspiring intrusion into the will of the creator of the forces of Yaroslav. The light and transparent breeze of the Nav is dressed in the high chivalrous creature of the poem with a delicate musicality, rising to the piercing power in the lament of Yaroslavna on the city wall.

This poem overflowed with inspiration into highly artistic images. From the fact that these images turned out to be lifelike, we must conclude that real life provided material for them, and that the same inspirations were manifested in the relationships, psychology, and everyday life of the masses. In the face of the author of "The Word," a princely warrior, a genius poet, that is, a poet "possessed" by a daemon, stood under a pouring stream of inspiration. The Kiev and Novgorod cycle of epic poems allow us to feel how the masses, the anonymous creators of low art and folklore, were transformed under this stream. They say: the simplicity, coarseness of epic poetry - what kind of spiritual inspiration can be talked about here? - But what qualities, if not these, distinguish the creation of the masses from the work of a highly cultured master? The simplicity, primitiveness of epic poetry do not at all refute the fact of inspiration, they only indicate that, weakened and muddled, it still penetrated into the dense layers of mass psychology.

She began gradually to color with peculiar tones the arts that were most closely associated with the myth of Christianity. This can be traced in iconography and frescoes - Kiev, Suzdal, and especially Novgorod. Iconic images of the Novgorod school sometimes impress with a turbulent dynamism and such bold, almost modern sharpness, which were completely alien, even hostile to the Byzantine tradition with its stateliness. Unfortunately, in this book, I only have the opportunity to outline a series of special themes that require development. Several such themes are laid out in any of these chapters, and I can only regret the brevity of the remaining span of my life. While the Cathedral Soulual intuition in many other metacultures expressed its knowledge of the existence of zatomises mainly in the language of legends, Russia begins to express spiritual knowledge of its heavenly prototype and doppelganger - Russia of Heaven - in the language of another art: architecture. From the 11th to the 18th century, all centers of Russian spiritual and especially religious life with an impressive sequence strive for the development, improvement, and repetition of the same image. This is an architectural ensemble, the axis of which is a white crystal - a white cathedral with golden domes and a pillar-like bell tower, around it - a host of small churches, often multicolored but almost always with golden domes; further - palaces, services, and residential choirs, and finally, a ring of mighty defensive walls with towers. At their foot - the emanation of the river.

This motif emerged over the Dnieper River in the early 11th century, and now it is repeating itself over the Volkhov River, and then its variants begin to multiply: in Pskov, Smolensk, Vladimir, Pereyaslavl, Chernigov, Rostov, Kolomna, Nizhny Novgorod, Ustyug, in Troitse-Sergiyeva, in large and small cities and even without cities, in a multitude of monasteries and kremlins; in the following epochs, it will reach its apotheosis in the Moscow Kremlin.

This is worth pondering. Attempts to exhaustively explain this phenomenon with purely military-political, technical, or even general cultural considerations would hardly be successful. Other countries situated under similar geographical conditions, during the same feudal relations, and, if one may put it that way, in similar religious climates, created entirely different artistic and mystical symbols, other aesthetic models and, in particular, architectural canons. The architectural ensemble, in general, did not become the predominant symbol, the synthetic reflection of transmif, the stone likeness of the "City of Vengeance," everywhere. In such a symbol, it developed in Egypt and Babylon, in India and some Buddhist countries, in Athens, but this did not happen in Iran, Japan, or the culture of northern India, and even the significance of medieval abbeys as such can only be discussed with a stretch of the imagination. Obviously, we are dealing here with an irrational factor, perhaps with the spiritual taste of a super-people. The roots of spiritual taste go back to its unfathomable depths, to the laws that bind the super-people to the higher reality above them.

Meanwhile, the era in which this image crystallized was becoming increasingly unfavorable from generation to generation.

If we tried to transfer the analogy of the three basic states of matter in our layer - solid, liquid, and gaseous - to worlds of a different materiality, we would see that in the meta-historical picture of Kievan Rus, the state of the East Slavic egregore could be likened to a sparse fog hovering over the land, barely beginning to take on vague contours. Whirlwind-like vortexes of Velga repeatedly tore this formation apart in various parts, and the pressure of the Polovtsian, Lithuanian, and Polish egregores constantly changed its outlines, causing confusion in its entire being and detachment of individual parts that began to live a damaged, phantom-like independent life. It was a weak creature unable to offer effective resistance to either Velga or the egregores of the steppe tribes.

In the 13th century, the exhausted Russian egregore was confronted by the dark-ether giant-monster, a militant Uitzraor of the Mongol tribal array. I don't know whether it was a fatal mistake of the demiurge of the Far East or other reasons that gave birth to it, but its growth was fantastically fast, and its greed insatiable. The victim of this creature was the Mongol metaculture itself, too young, with barely emerging synclite, and now being drawn into the vortex of meta-historical designs against the opposite god. The demonic mind was now playing a game of no-lose: either the Russian metaculture would collapse under the pressure of a stronger enemy, or Yarosvet would have to oppose the Uitzraor of Mongolia with a similar monster in order to protect the very physical existence of the Russian people. This is the first mighty blow dealt to Rus by Gagtungor, and this is the same meta-historical event that stands behind the first great catastrophe of our history: the invasion of the Tatars.

It can be evaluated differently - and historians evaluate differently the extent of the social-political, cultural, and moral damage inflicted on Russia by the Tatar yoke. However, considering the events from a meta-historical perspective, we can only supplement the positions of historical science with the following indication: the impact of the forces of Velga, which manifested itself so vividly in princely strife, cleared the way for another, more powerful force, and both these groups of forces ultimately represented the will of the same infra-physical institution. What shook Velga had to crush the Mongolian witzraor; if it had not been possible to do so completely, he would have had another weapon in reserve, which would have had to unfold its activity at other times and by other methods: the black core in the being of the future Russian witzraor.

Indeed, under the blows of the Mongolian monster, the Russian egregore was crushed, half torn to shreds, barely preserving life and the ability to reunite in the future. The Carrosse Dingre suffered damage, which - if we were talking about physical beings - could be compared to bleeding. Yarosvet himself was defeated in a battle with the Mongolian giant on the borders of Holy Russia; it was only with great difficulty that the young, still weak and small synod managed to save only the most sacred shrines of their heavenly country from destruction.

Saved by the demiurge, Navna was removed from the desolate southern region of Holy Russia to the inaccessible virgin lands, corresponding to the dense northern forests in Enroth. The misty formations of the wounded, half-destroyed egregore clothed her new abode in beggarly attire. The enemy's onslaught did not weaken: Velga, who had satisfied herself, fled to her Gashsharvu, but the Mongolian witsraor constantly rushed through the heavenly country like a hurricane, extinguishing lights, drying up meta-etheric sources, and on the earthly soil of Russia, dividing that living material substance of the super-people from which the etheric bodies of all its individual members are formed, and without which life in Enroth is impossible, not only for the people, but also for the individual person. It became clear that the tasks for which the bright dyad had assumed an etheric embodiment were impossible to accomplish until Dingra recreated the national flesh; until the most powerful weapon, Gagdungra, was opposed by an opponent in the same plane of being: a powerful, all-powerful demon of statehood. The choice was before the demiurge of the super-people: either the creation of a Leviathan-state in Enroth and the consequent emergence of the Russian schrastre, populated by igvams, or a refusal to fulfill his mission on earth. He chose the former.

Obviously, the demiurge, who had not yet distinguished ideal social organization as a distant obligation from the state as a real possibility, realized the categorical necessity of the latter - the necessity of the state, and moreover, necessarily very strong, as a form of a super-people, the only one capable of protecting its physical existence, guarding against centrifugal internal forces - projections of Velga and against external attacks - projections of today's Uitzraora Mongolia, and tomorrow of some other. Who knows whether Yarosvet's idea of the necessity of a strong state merged with his idea of an ideal social organization, which was supposed to be the fruit of his upcoming marriage to Navna. Did he understand with complete clarity that, descending to Dingra's carriage as the father of their common offspring, by begetting Uitzraora from her and dooming Navna to captivity in the depths of the future statehood, he was pushing the day of his marriage to Navna into an unimaginable distant future? - Either way, Dingra's carriage gave birth to the first of Russia's Uitzraors, carrying within itself, along with maternal blood, a cursed eitsekhore. Isn't it clear what this means?

The sculptress of the physical substance of the super-people gives birth to the demon of great power from two origins: from the demiurge of the super-people and from the one who once invaded the flesh of the Lilithian poets: Gagtungra. Thus, eitsekhore was supposed to become a kind of curse, ruling over Russian statehood and fatally distorting the realization of the Russian people's world mission.

Could Yarosvet avoid the birth of the demon of great power? Could he preserve the physical existence of the super-people in any other way? Don't examples from other cultures confirm that Uitzraors are inevitable participants in any meta-historical process, its inevitable evil, its internal contradiction?

But then Gagtungr took care of the birth of this race of transphysical monsters in Babylon. Something like a chain reaction occurred: every demiurge of any metaculture found himself forced to oppose the malicious enraged enemy with an identical defender. The defender, in turn, grew into an attacking predator, thereby necessitating neighboring metacultures' demiurges to do the same. Now only small nations within the superethnic group, but not the superethnic group itself, are devoid of witzraorov. Since Babylon, there is no metaculture without witzraorov.

As for Yarosvet, his fervent dream prevented him from discerning the laws of perspective in this new world of historical reality. He was not yet able to draw a precise line between real statehood and ideal national organization, between creating a state and the ultimate goal of his marriage. Only with the painful experience of life and creativity could a demiurge attain the wisdom to teach him how to distinguish the near from the distant, the currently possible from the obligatory limit. The nature of the state itself was still unclear to him, and he hardly realized the irreconcilability of the autocratic state element with ideal national organization, just as he did not recognize that this national organization could only be achieved in the distant future when the physical preservation of the superethnic group was ensured by the unification of humanity into a single monolith.

But the thing is that there can be several types of nation-building, and understanding the differences between them is of the utmost importance. Of course, the attached table provides only a few of the most important types, having nothing to do with attempts to exhaust all their diversity and omitting many transitional or insufficiently defined forms.

1. The liquid state of statehood. The incipience of centralizing state power. Constant clashes between poorly organized constituent units. The power of tribal egregores and vampiric formations like Velgi. The influence of the diad of the super-people, still very young, mainly on the aesthetic and religious spheres of consciousness. Examples: Egypt of the nomes era, Vedic India, Greece of the polis era, Europe in the early Middle Ages.
2. A solid-viscous state of statehood, sufficiently soft for transformative work. Limitation of tyrannical tendencies by the balance of socio-political forces. State governance is carried out by a demiurge through egregores. His marriage to the Ideal Cathedral Soul. Examples: Egypt before Tutankhamun, Buddhist states in India and Southeast Asia, the Tang and Song empires in China, Athens during the time of Pericles.
3. Extremely solid state of statism. Despotic colossus state. Tyranny of the demon of great power. The etheric incarnation of the Cathedral Soul is preserved, but its freedom of action is greatly restricted, meaning that it is imprisoned within the confines of the state. At the end of this stage, and sometimes even earlier, the demiurge withdraws his sanction from the demon of statism. Examples: great empires-tyrannies, Assyria, Carthage, Rome, Baghdad, the empires of Genghis Khan, Tamerlane, Spain in the 16th century, Britain in the 18th-19th centuries, Napoleon's empire, Hitler's state, and so on.
4. Hierocracy. The capture of the church by the state-forming forces' egregore. Either its transformation into a vampiric monster similar to the Uitstaoriches, making universal claims and transferring its abode from the sakkual of the egregores to Gashsharvu (the papacy in the late Middle Ages); or confinement within ethnic boundaries and the draining of internal sources (Tibet). In the first case, there is a struggle against it by the diad of the super-nation and the synclita, even rebelling against the distorted myth of international religion. In the second case, the freedom of action of the bright diad is limited by the infraphysics of metaculture on the one hand and the forces of the Highest Transmyth of international religion on the other.
5. The fragmentation of the unified structure of the super-people into multiple solid state units. The development of local forces that have broken free from the control of hierarchies. The weakening of the active creative force of the latter. The state of the Cathedral Soul, similar to a state of deep illness. Examples: the Mediterranean in the 4th-5th centuries AD; Muslim countries after the caliphate; Germany after the Thirty Years' War.
6. Foreign enslavement. The organization of the people that has turned into an instrument of other hierarchies pursuing their own goals unrelated to the super-people. The state of the Cathedral Soul equivalent to a state of slavery.
7. A softened type of state organization created on the condition of the social-ethical maturity of the super-people and the absence of external threats. Subordination of the state element directly to the forces of the demiurge. The beginning of the extinction of the principle of violence. The opening up of the possibility for hierarchies to prepare an ideal people organization. The state of the Cathedral Soul as the spouse of the demiurge. Examples: to date, this type has only been achieved in some small countries, in its purest form - in Scandinavia, Switzerland. It can be hoped that in the future this type will acquire super-people meta-cultural proportions, only under which super-people meta-cultural fruits are possible.
8. Inter-Supernational Union. Currently only a theoretically conceived state formation, transitioning to a planetary union. Co-creation of demiurges.
9. Ideal societal structure. Abolition of the state. Transformation of the human state structure into brotherhood. A perfect societal structure, only into which the born hierarchical etheric expression of Eternal Femininity can be accepted.

What is clear now, could not have been clear a thousand years ago, even to the demiurge. His alliance with Dingra and the birth of Uitzraora erected a long-lasting barrier between Yarosvet and Navna. And although at that time it was impossible for the demiurge to fully comprehend the multifaceted meaning of what had happened, it became clear that this barrier would fall and the opportunity for the creative realization of their task would open up only when the perfect mistake was atoned for, that is, when its consequences were exhausted. The terrifying length of this atonement began to unfold.

What had happened was a powerful impetus for his spiritual growth. The first encounter with the true enemy of the light caste revealed to the demiurge the depth of the world's dualism, the insolubility of which he had not previously grasped. A burning sorrow, inherent in the realization of the first great failure in life, enveloped him; only now did the tragedy of the Byzantine demiurge become clear and the possibility of his own collapse, only on an even greater, already universal scale.

The situation was further complicated by the fact that the birth and childhood of witzraora visibly justified what had been done: the demon of statehood turned out to be exactly the force that the super-people needed to defend themselves against Velgi and foreign witzraors.

The area of the strongest inspirations of the First Zhrugra in Enrofe was determined in a certain geographical area, on the banks of the Moscow River, and here the process of concentration and education of the forces of metacultural and historical self-defense began.

This was one of those rare (in the life of any nation) periods when forces, various in their nature, hierarchical levels, and goals, combined their efforts in common work.

A deeply significant object of contemplation for the meta-historian remains the process in which personalities like Alexander Nevsky, whose wisdom and will were strengthened by the Demiurge, whose purity of intent was protected by Navna, the sculptress of the people's flesh, prepared the succession, the demon of great power strengthened the power of his sword, and the forces of the Christian Transmyth guarded him with their covering made of the bright ether of the people's prayers, the martyrdom of those who perished in battle or in the Tatar Horde, and the spiritual work of the luminaries of the church. No wonder his death was echoed by waves of grief throughout the country, and in later times the most irreconcilable movements of the popular spirit see their distant predecessor in this kind of lineage.

The activity of the demiurge, which so clearly blessed this demon's activity, has never been reflected in a series of historical facts as much as in the warm assistance provided by the pastors of Russia, the heads of the church, to the grand princes of Moscow, and in their justification of the gathering of Russia as the highest national-religious and moral goal, which was illuminated by the banner of church authority. This series of phenomena, which had such a vivid impact on the activities of the great Moscow metropolitans, reaches its highest expression in the blessing of Dmitry Donskoy for the battle against the Tatars by the greatest saint of that time, and in the person of the monk Peresvet, who opened the Kulikovo battle with his struggle against the Tatar champion.

When the geographical center of Russian metaculture was established, it was natural and inevitable that this Cathedral Soulual center and citadel of statehood should be crowned with a physical likeness of the peak of the super-national transmyth: the earthly Kremlin. The demons and other forces of the demiurge, sent to their souls, minds, and wills by Moscow princes and metropolitans, monks and boyars, architects and icon painters, celebrated and nameless, revealed to them those images of Heavenly Russia and Fongarandy that awaited their reflection in stone and brick. And so it began to emerge: slowly, laboriously, from year to year and from century to century, burdened, disorderly, constantly changing, distorted by chance, maimed by fires, attacks by foreigners, and the arbitrariness of authorities, with the golden crown of the kingdom on its forehead and the stamp of slavery and wounds of martyrdom on its face - and yet it was the most beautiful of all that was possible at the spiritual and material level of medieval Russia.

### Chapter 2. Christian Myth and Proto-russianism

A detailed analysis of the highly complex and broad question of the meta-historical significance of the Orthodox Church and even more so, the entire Christian myth, would require a multi-volume work or even an entire cycle of works. However, it is clear and natural that the inner mystical life of the Russian Church was determined by the connection with the general Christian transmyth and with those hierarchies and entities, cosmic and planetary, that were revered by the Russian Church: with Logos, with the Virgin Mary, with the angelic orders and with the great spiritual leaders of the general Christian or Byzantine past. Their high level of ascent opened up the possibility of active assistance from above, from the zatomis, from the Heavenly Jerusalem and from the Synclite of Humanity, down to the layer of concrete historical reality, in Enrof.

For many centuries, the Christian myth permeated and enveloped the spiritual life of Russian society, having a decisive impact on all areas of the culture of those times - from "weaving words", as they understood the art of the written word, to the ornamentation of utensils or the cut of clothing. However, an analysis would easily reveal in the stock of images that saturated these arts, and in the aesthetic canons that were then developed, a huge layer that has no direct relation to the ideology or pantheon of Christianity.

The grassy patterns on fabrics and tablecloths are just as far from the Christian myth in its pure form as the Firebird of our fairy tales, the heroes of our epic poems, the architectural features of our terems, or the stylized roosters and fantastic beasts that decorated the stoves, spinning wheels, and sledges of our huts. This layer of imagery, of course, dates back to pre-Christian attitudes towards the world, to the embryonic and never fully developed Slavic mythology. But what is important is that this attitude towards the world persisted as strongly in the 17th century as it did in the 12th century; it only began to fade away, or rather change its appearance, in the 20th century. It was never overcome or assimilated by the Christian myth. What happened instead was the parallel coexistence of two attitudes towards the world, characterized by a division of spheres of manifestation. One of them, the Christian one, quickly achieved dominance as a nationwide and popular circle of ideas, displacing its rival from a number of areas of life, and above all, from the field of generalizing and systematizing thought. The second attitude took refuge in folklore, in low and applied art, in folk rituals and spells, in daily life, but it never rose to the level of philosophical or ideological generalizations.

On the other hand, we cannot but be amazed by its extraordinary stability and phenomenal vitality. This vitality alone speaks to metahistory about the fact that this worldview was not rooted in random or transient features of the national psychology, but in those that are organically inherent to the people. If we are dealing with organic and indestructible features of the national psychology, then we always have before us a factor related to the manifestation of the creativity of hierarchies, since everything in the people that is outside the sphere of their activity, not bearing the stamp of their work, turns out to be short-lived, superficial, and ephemeral. In the aspect of the relationship under consideration, which was linked to the continuation of the lineage, everything related to the increase in the level and intensity of the sexual drive is distinguished by the murky, hot, and restless substance of the carossa of Dinge. Actually, under the conditions of a Christian country, there was no other sphere for its manifestation.

But in this worldview, there is also another predominantly aesthetic layer. The creative joy experienced by artists and masters in creating this ornamentation, these fairy tales and these terems, still overflows into our souls at the slightest touch to them; the love for the world, nature, and the elements that is poured into them testifies that not the carossa, but the forces of the demiurge himself were blowing in the human soul that created these works.

This worldview (since we are talking about the Russian national past) now has to be extracted from under the layers of the Christian myth either through painstaking scientific analysis or through meta-historical contemplation and reflection. I would call this worldview "prorossianism."

In essence, prorossianism is nothing more than the first stage of the development of the myth of the Russian superpeople.

The general Transmyth of Christianity in itself does not contradict and cannot contradict the Transmyths of super-peoples; it does not conflict with them and cannot conflict with them. On the contrary, the World Salveterra, permeated with the forces of Logos and Bogomater, that is, the highest reality of Christian Transmyth, remains at the same time the pinnacle of pinnacles, vaguely shining through the Transmyths of super-peoples. The historical prospects of the future would be gloomy and joyless if they were not illuminated by our belief in such a future world relationship, when the Christian myth will complement the myths of super-peoples, merging with them into a harmonious whole. But in the historical past, the mature Christian myth as it were covered the barely emerging myth of the Russian super-people. Covered - and due to the same inherent characteristics of historical churches, with their detrimental narrowness, the need to assert their religious aspect of the world as the only and universal truth, excluding even the possibility of the existence of others.

No matter how reverent the meta-historian's subjective attitude to the Christian myth may be, no matter how highly he may rate the role of the latter in the cultural history of Russia, he is unlikely to be able to completely get rid of a sense of bitterness and regret, even some unconscious resentment, when studying any of the arts of medieval Russia. He will feel that those germinal elements of genuinely national world relations, which still tried to manifest themselves at least in art, were uncomfortably and painfully narrow. The formula "The world lies in evil" prevailed. And love for it, childlike joy of life, sunny cheerfulness and immediacy barely dared to reveal their existence in the bright coloring of utensils, in the fairy-tale toy-like, I would say laughing style of tiles or carvings, in the backgrounds of icons, where flowers, heavenly lights, and fabulous animals create an amazing background, emanating touchingly pure, pantheistic love for the world.

Monastic asceticism prevailed. And the lowest levels of human life were given to Dingra's creative activity, the secret background of human life. The connection of spirituality with the physical side of love seemed sacrilegious: on the wedding night, images were tightly covered because even love sanctified by the sacrament of marriage remained a sin.

The Christian pantheon prevailed. And the soul, capturing the breath of the hierarchies of the supernatural and the elements, did not even dare to realize the existence of these hierarchies, which did not find a place in the Christian pantheon and were not sanctioned by church authority. The truths of theology and knowledge seemed exhausted by the two Testaments and the teachings of the fathers of the church, and any independent work of thought would be considered suspicious, if not heretical.

The attitude towards art as a secondary form of expression of the same truths of the Christian myth prevailed. Secular painting did not emerge, sculpture was perceived as paganism, poetry languished within the limits of folklore, dance was barely tolerated even in the form of formal round dances, and the beginnings of theatrical performances were harshly uprooted.

Comparing all of this, it's interesting to note one type of art in which paganism and Christian myth were able to coexist side by side, as if dividing the territory between them and hardly even mixing mechanically, while at the same time, artistically and psychologically complementing each other. I'm talking about some schools of church architecture, from the tent-like church to the so-called "Naryshkin baroque". What is striking about these monuments is one characteristic that is perhaps most vividly evident in St. Basil's Cathedral: the contrast between the exterior and the interior. The infectious, soulful joyfulness of these colorful onion domes and chubby columns, these walls, naively transformed into cheerful patterns resembling fairy-tale gardens... And when you enter inside, you feel as if you have stepped into another culture, although, impossible as it may seem, it is almost as Russian: lattice windows, narrow narthexes, low vaults, heavy pillars, stern faces, half-light. The myth of the super-people, banished outside, and opposing the world, creating the inner space, the self-sufficient and intolerant Christian myth. Paganism and Orthodoxy. Not synthesis, not even mixing, but almost mechanical delimitation of spheres of action. And if we speak of any dialectic, it is the thesis and antithesis.

It can be argued that frescoes and icons in our churches, being cleansed of the layers of centuries, reveal much brighter colors and more lively ornamental motifs to the eyes than is commonly thought. Yes, but if the cheerful character of some murals was influenced by the spirit of ancient Russia, then time worked against it, dampening the vibrancy of colors with the smoke of candles and lamps, inevitable and integral attributes of the cult. A unified color scheme was created that corresponded perfectly to the low arches, tiny windows, and the overall minor key of worship. The greatest unity and expressiveness were achieved through the combination of techniques, specifically in the interior of St. Basil's Cathedral with its division of internal space into numerous isolated cells, from which the worship was not visible, but only audible, and where the atmosphere encouraged internal, solitary prayer.

And in general, isn't it striking in the appearance of Russian sanctuaries of any era, from the Byzantine-style single-domed temple handed down to us to the Empire-style churches of the 19th century, the contrast between the exterior and interior, form and content? Oh, this is not harmony at all! The Russian church is harmonious, yes, as long as we contemplate it from the outside: whether it's a snow-white cube with golden roofs or a colorful tower-like flower, bending with its wooden or stone petals and seeming to be in eternal joy. It is also harmonious inside, but with a completely different harmony. But between these two harmonies - a gap, mutual incomprehension, and hidden enmity.

In the field of church architecture, the Christian myth (for reasons not entirely clear) nevertheless tolerated and silently accepted the territorial coexistence with the myth of the super-people.^^1 However, in other areas of culture and life, as I have already noted, the situation was much worse. It is not surprising that under such conditions, Proto-Russian culture could not develop into any autonomous system or doctrine. It could not even realize its own existence. For such awareness, it is necessary to have at least some kind of pillar, axis, or central image that belongs to this myth and only to it; but there was no such pillar. The influence of the Demiurge and Navs on the individual and the nation as a whole did not rise above the threshold of consciousness; and what was experienced in the soul was attributed to the actions of other authorities: authorities that exclusively belonged to the Christian myth.

____________
^^1: One of the episodes of the Church's struggle with this myth in church architecture can be seen in the prohibition (in the 17th century) of tented churches in favor of a return to the canonical Byzantine type.

If we are able to be surprised about anything in this matter, it is that Proto-Russian culture was not completely destroyed. Moreover, the impression is created that someone has always set a certain limit to the hostile pressure of the Christian myth, someone who, century after century, protected the weak fields of Proto-Russian culture from the trampling onslaught of the militant church. The Demiurge, himself involved in the Christian Transmyth, but free from human limitations, guarded this area of the potential of the Cathedral Soul for distant, great ages; he himself fertilized it with his breath; the Nav nourished it with its flickering spiritual dew.

But an even deeper wisdom, the wisdom of sacrificial self-restraint, is reflected in the fact that Yarosvet did not give the pre-Rus myth the opportunity for wild growth and powerful flowering. Where could this lead? If pre-Rus mythology had realized itself, formed a system, and claimed the role of a dominant ideology - a terrible struggle to the death between it and Christian myth would have been inevitable. A struggle - and the destruction of one of the sides. But in the eyes of the highest wisdom, both sides are precious, both justified by a single Truth hidden within them under the cover of two truths. Will Christianity be eradicated in Rus, will the pre-Rus justification of the world wither away - and one of the two foundations of the future synthetic culture will disappear. Both must be preserved until those distant times when it will be possible for both of them to transition into a common harmonious attitude towards the world and towards God, free from the narrowness and epochal limitations of one and the thoughtlessness and lack of intellectualism of the other.

After all, we have determined only the inhibiting effect of the Christian myth on the myth of the super-people. But the same process had another side. Behind the Christian myth flickered not a phantom play of random shadows, but a higher reality, the Christian Transmyth - the Heavenly Jerusalem and the spheres of the World of Salvation. Even the slightest touch to these values ​​of the highest order (not to mention those cases when the life of the one who touched them was transformed into a spiritual feat, into a hagiography) - contained an inexhaustible source of spiritual strength, gave a powerful impetus to the impulse of internal self-creation. Of course, this self-creation was essentially directed along an ascetic, monastic path; secular righteousness, although respected, was considered to be lower, a preparatory step towards monasticism. But if Orthodoxy had developed and succeeded in realizing the ideal of righteousness in civil, family, social, and state matters, it would have meant that a stage of human perfection had been achieved that has not been achieved anywhere else in the world. In other words, this would only have been possible in two cases: either if the mission of Christ was completed and not interrupted, or if a new stream of cosmic spiritual forces had flowed from the macro-brahman in Shadanakar, weakening Gagtowngra and powerfully contributing to the transformation of humanity.

In the 16th century, Sylvester made an attempt, the significance of which is not fully understood to this day. "Domostroy" is an attempt to create a grandiose religious and moral code, which was supposed to establish and implement the ideals of secular, family, and social morality into life. The task is colossal: its scope is comparable to what Confucius accomplished for his people and culture. Of course, it is very easy to blame Sylvester's failure on the discrepancy between his personal scale and the scale of such tasks. But can't we turn this question inside out: is it not precisely such a person who took on such a task precisely because the small scale of his personality did not allow him to understand the grandeur of the task or its impracticability at that stage of cultural and religious development? Isn't it precisely because in medieval Russia no truly great spiritual person dared to approach such a task, that spiritual insight and wisdom could not fail to suggest its prematureness to him? As is well known, Sylvester managed to create a fairly tightly knit, sturdy-looking, completely flat system that strikes with its gracelessness. There is no scope that characterizes everything inspired by the demiurge, no spiritual beauty, without which no Involution of Navna can exist, no fiery spirit that blows in creations inspired by the authorities of Christian transmutation. It's a completely different spirit: infinitely self-confident, obsessively demanding, self-centered, doctrinaire, hypocritically masking the ideal of social mobility behind the mask of godly strengthening of social harmony - a harmony that did not exist in real life. In subsequent epochs, we will meet this heavy, down-to-earth, strong-willed spirit again and again - in completely different works, in different doctrines - the spirit of the state demon.

The enduring value of what the Russian Christian myth created in terms of ethics lies not in attempts to create a universal code of ethics, but in the effective development of a harsh monastic path. Russian culture, or rather metaculture, owes its greatest righteous men to this ascetic path. The history of medieval Russia is characterized by a complete absence of creators of comprehensive philosophical and scientific concepts, a limited number of artistic geniuses, a large number of heroes (although many of their names have been lost to posterity), and not a constellation, but a whole starry sky of righteous men. Hundreds of their names have been preserved by the Church. Such a correlation was determined once again by the power of the Christian myth, which brought from Byzantium an equal attitude towards various forms of spiritual creativity.

No matter how one views the ascetic principle in relation to the conditions of life, ideals, and psychological climate of the 20th century, there can be no doubt for meta-history that the rigorous discipline of this path contributes to the ultimate concentration of inner strength on the mutual mystical connection between man and the highest authorities of the spiritual world. How could it not? If it did not contribute to this, then what else could? The average consciousness of our century definitely seeks revenge for its narrow understanding of such things, as did the average consciousness of Kievan and Muscovite Rus with its oppositely directed narrowness. Accusations of selfishness, self-centeredness, which are sometimes thrown at representatives of the ascetic path, are only valid in relation to those who have profaned this path, but with respect to those who are called saints, such accusations are based on ignorance or misunderstanding. Only a consistently materialistic view is logical, which does not see any value in the inner development of the individual if this development is not manifested very quickly in external actions visible to all. But if we adopted materialism, then there would be no point, and it would simply be impossible to start the book "The Rose of the World". Internal development, in general, and the cell and cloister, in particular, reveal in a person that which enables him to serve humanity and help it from seclusion. But this is not enough: a religious worldview cannot contemplate life on earth without its continuation in the afterlife; in this continuation, it is precisely the righteous person who has the opportunity, more than anyone else, to use those strongest spiritual tools, those means of helping humanity and all lower worlds, those means of combating the dark principle, which he has endured and developed within himself for decades of self-creation and self-purification.

In a meta-historical sense, the existence not only of Nile of Sora or Seraphim of Sarov, but also of righteous people of lesser height, lesser spiritual greatness, lesser direct influence on the popular psychology and morality, even righteous people who may have remained completely unknown to us - is more important for metaculture than the existence of thousands of people of spiritual mediocrity. There is "its own arithmetic" there. Let us remember that at the same time as gavvah, eifos, the emanations of envy, greed, avarice, malice compensate for the loss of vital forces in the country of demons, the emanations of spiritual joy, religious enthusiasm, and reverence become the finest material for the creation of zatomisov; rejoicing replenishes the vital forces of angels; emanations of high love between a man and a woman rise up to those worlds which are designated here as the Waves of Worldly Femininity, and only the azure distant glows of which we can perceive in moments of admiration; while compassion, inspiration, the creative flame of people strengthen the abode of the Logos of Shadanakar.

The devil in "The Brothers Karamazov" tried, of course, to caricature these regularities by reducing their principle to absurdity: according to him, the soul of one ascetic is worth as much as a whole constellation. Constellations are not constellations, but in any case, reason would be shaken and outraged if it could be convinced of the strange laws of the beyond arithmetic. However, it will not seem so strange if we remember that the existence of Pushkin is more important for Russian poetry than the existence of millions of people writing bad poetry. Of course, this does not mean that the value of people is measured only by their attitude towards poetry, as well as their attitude towards righteousness.

The gift of holiness is just as much a gift as genius or the unshakeable axis of heroic temperament that makes a person capable not only of a single heroic act (many are capable of this), but of turning their life into a heroic tale. All three of these gifts (as well as the gift of ancestry, but that is a different matter) are based on the fact that one of the daemons is sent from childhood (less often in adulthood) to a specific human personality who stands out due to their innate ability to perceive the bright inspiration of the hierarchies. Messengers from the world of winged humanity, where the mission of Christ was triumphantly completed and humanity itself has greatly surpassed us in its spiritual development, the daemons see one of their main tasks as helping the lower layers of existence, the backward, generally subject to elevation. Vigilant over people endowed with a bright gift, that is, a special mission, the daemons become conduits through which the influence of providential principles flows into the mind and will of the individual. It is precisely the feeling of their presence that gives rise to such enduring notions as the conviction of many genius poets of the presence of inspiring muses, religious figures of the presence of guardian angels, and certain thinkers of the influence of daemons on them in a completely literal sense.

In summary, we can say that the absolute value of the Christian myth lies in itself, while its particular positive value for the metaculture of Russia was that it revealed to the super-people as a subject of cognition the depth and height of the highest spheres of Shadanakar that the demiurge himself strives for, taking the super-people as his creation. The Christian trans-myth contains (although it is barely revealed in the Christian myth) the universal duty that lies beyond - or above - any zatomises, any stichials, any hierarchies.

Of all the cultures of humanity that have existed up to now and have fully defined themselves, only two have proven capable of breaking through local boundaries and spreading their principles throughout almost the entire globe: the Roman Catholic culture and the Northwestern culture. No matter how many reasons historians may find for this influence - social-economic, geographic, cultural - and no matter how much they try to silence the dissatisfaction with their explanations, for the meta-historian who does not reject the relative importance and mechanisms of these causes, something else remains primary. This primary cause is sought in the fact that the Christian myth, originally linked not only to Eden and Montsalvat but also to the reality of the Heavenly Jerusalem and the very World Savior, conveyed to the European spirit its true scales and made it capable of a truly universal mission.

The two other Christian metacultures, Byzantine and Abyssinian, were so tightly squeezed by demonic forces that the existence of one of them in Enrof ceased completely, while the other was hopelessly delayed in its path.

The fifth metaculture, imbued with the rays of the Christian Transmyth, was the Russian metaculture. Due to a number of external and internal reasons, it developed more slowly than its Western sisters, but nevertheless it overcame a number of deadly dangers, withstood staggering pressures, and by the second millennium of its historical existence, it entered the world stage, and for its friends and enemies alike, it was a formidable force with its all-encompassing potential.

Truthfully, other international religions were connected, at least in part, to the higher layers of Shadanakar, which were superior to the metaculture of the Zatomis. It seemed that the spiritual proportions necessary for tasks of universal scale could be conveyed to their supranational communities as well. However, in the Muslim myth, three layers are seen from a meta-historical perspective. One reflects the trans-myth of the Muslim supranation and is directed solely at this trans-myth, that is, to the Zatomis of Jannat. The other offers its own, reduced and distorted, but still based on the spiritual reality of the Christian myth. And the third seems to be trying to break through into metaphampture, but did not realize the existence of the World Savior, the existence of the Planetary Logos, and thus set a limit for itself, condemning itself to not revealing the potential for true universality within Islam as a religion. The reflection of universal aspiration, trembling in millions of souls caught up in this religion in its early centuries, made its magnificent spread possible, its expansion to a whole range of countries; but beneath this psychological drive towards the universal lay no ontological universality. It is precisely because of this that Islam, as a spreading religion, quickly exhausted itself and does not dare to think about expanding further than it was able to achieve in the distant past. 

Buddhist contemplation, except for, it seems, the state of "abhidjnana" of Gautama Buddha himself, stops at Nirvana, or rather, at the highest aspect worlds of the Buddhist Transmyth, not striving to realize even the highest spheres of Shadanakar. A sense of deep hopelessness, disbelief in the possibility of transforming worlds and enlightenment of the Law pervades this religion throughout. This is natural for all religions that arose before the incarnation of the Planetary Logos in Enroth. It is also natural that this hopelessness paralyzed any aspiration towards universality. If there is anything surprising here, it is rather that Buddhism still found the strength to spread outward, although, of course, its spirit of proselytism has long since faded into the past.

As for Hinduism, the same reason was expressed in the fate of this religion, as well as the historical peculiarity that Hinduism remained almost completely alien to any kind of proselytism.

On the contrary, the consciousness of the Russian super-people was imbued with the Christian myth from the very beginning, with a premonition of a universal mission—not a mission of world domination, but a mission of a higher truth that it must proclaim and establish on earth for the benefit of all. This is evident in the tone of the Kiev and Moscow chronicles and in the implicit but indisputable ideology of the epics, which interpreted their heroes as carriers and fighters for a higher spiritual truth, shining for anyone who is ready to open themselves to it. Furthermore, this self-awareness creates ideal images of Holy Rus: not great, not mighty, not beautiful, but precisely holy.^^2 Finally, in the idea of the Third Rome, this feeling is crystallized quite clearly.

As for the slow pace of development, who obliges us to consider it only from a causal point of view and not from a teleological one? Is it impossible for it to be expedient in the scale of world meta-history for Russian culture to enter the world stage precisely when it did? However, we are touching upon a problem here which is still premature to discuss in this place.

### Chapter 3. The Era of the First Witzraor

So, the metahistorical event that underlies what is called the elevation of Moscow and the creation of a national state was the birth of the kaross Dingroy from Yarosvet, the demon of great power, and the strengthening of his demiurgic powers to fight the common enemy.

But in the face of his creation and his successors - two demons of great power who inherited the first one - Yarosvet acquired, as it were, a metahistorical rival who also had to strive for a planetary goal, but fundamentally distorted its meaning.

The triunity of the nature of the first of the Zhruvrovs made his path and the path of his successors complex and tragic, their metahistorical destiny and the destiny of what they created in history.

Over the centuries, with the change of three generations of witzraors, with the expansion of their horizons and the increase of the power of the impulse of their world mission, they begin to realize it in its true volume. Of course, the clarity that this awareness reached in the last of the witzraors could not be achieved by the first one. And yet, by the 16th century, the idea of a world mission, Christian-demiurgic in nature but continuously distorted, becomes the highest sanction by which the first demon of the Russian great power justifies himself and his universal claims. This is the idea of the Third Rome - an amalgam of Orthodox religious exclusivity, witzraoric national pride, and historical fantasies characteristic of early stages of culture, with a premonition of the planetary scale of the future emanating from the demiurge and a high ethical dream inspired by the Transmyth of Christianity.

But the yetzerhare, trapped in witzraor, gradually fills this impulse with different content, putting before it a different, externally similar but internally opposite goal. The essence of yetzerhare consists of an insurmountable and painful desire for the possessor to absorb everything into their own self. Ultimately, they want to be alone in the universe, having consumed it all within themselves. This drive towards ideal tyranny is inherent in any demonic monad, but in witzraor, it is not only present but also clearly recognized. Witzraor is beyond ethics. This does not mean that it has other, non-human ethical beliefs; rather, it is entirely incapable of contemplating the world from an ethical perspective.

The third element of witzraor inherited from Dingir is uncontrollability and impulsivity, to some degree inherent in all elementals but reaching its extreme in Lilith and the karrokh. Hence, the strength of its emotions, their incredible intensity, and despite all of Zhugra's cunning, the inadequacy of its controlling mind.

The ethereal fabric of the Russian egregore was consumed by the demon of statism. The egregore, as a kind of personality with a semblance of consciousness and will, ceased to exist. The emanations of human psyches that had become its fabric became the sustenance of Zhugra. Thus, its existence became dependent on the continuous inflow of those ethereal forces possessed only by the mass of concrete human entities.

Like the witzraors of any metaculture, for the upcoming - already foreseeable - struggle with the demigod, synclite, and the Cathedral Soul, he is forced to take the most active part in the construction of the new citadel of anti-humanity - Drukkarga, and in creating conditions for the settlement of its races, the rarrugs and igv. From now on, the interests of Zhrugra and Russian anti-humanity begin to coincide almost entirely, because he and the population of Drukkarga are interested in shavva - the nutrient dew that comes from Enrof Russia, in victories over synclite and demigod, in keeping Navna captive in the fortress of Drukkarga, and in the upcoming exit of igv to Enrof, and in their capture of all three - and four-dimensional levels of Shadanakar. Both sides are interested, of course, in weakening and then conquering all other planes, other witzraors, and all other metacultures in general.

From here comes the complex nature of the Moscovite state. As if being a fortress wall around the Russian bright diad and Dingra, defending them from the pressure of external egregores and witzraors, that is, protecting the people from foreign enslavement, Zhrugr and its projection in Enrof - the state - perform the task entrusted to them by the Demiurge. Zhrugr remains within the limits of this task even when it strives to expand the state to the natural geographical boundaries of the country or seizes vacant spaces, the future arena of life and creativity for the multiplying super-people. But when this process of natural expansion turns into a process of super-state swelling, the limit of which is only the boundaries of the planetary sphere, the witzraor becomes the tormentor of the people and the slave of its satanic core. To put it even more plainly, it becomes an absolutely obedient instrument of the Great Tormentor, who has tried several times in world history to create a dark-etheric organism that would encompass the entire then-known earthly Enrof for the sake of bringing closer the day when universal tyranny will create the prerequisites for the appearance of the Antichrist. Such attempts, or rather rehearsals, were the Roman Empire, the Empire of Timur, the papal hierarchy, and the empire of Philip II, in which "the sun never set", and the world colonial empires of modern times.

Naturally, even in those cases when the witzraor ceases to limit itself to that amount of violence without which the existence of any state is impossible in relation to its own people and, tormented by insatiable greed and burning desire for absolute power, turns its state into a continuous system of tentacles, sucking shavva into the bottomless infraphysical womb, all of this turns out to be only the other side of its activity as an instrument of the Great Tormentor.

The vampiric structure inherited from Gagtung-ra gives the bloated flesh of Witzraor a vampire-like character, with countless suckers embedded in the people's body, in its etheric and astral tissue. Witzraor exists only insofar as it can absorb shavva, that is, the radiation of people associated with the state complex of their psyche. But by absorbing this shavva, it needs constant replenishment and multiplication. First and foremost, it needs the number of units that make up the population to increase, and then it needs the psyche of these units to emit the largest amount of radiation from the state complex, rather than any other radiation. Interestingly, in some historical epochs, the Witzraors' concern for increasing the population of the country is reflected even in the legislative systems, but in other epochs, these Molochs of the empire paradoxically contribute to the quantitative growth of the super-people. The second goal is to multiply such human units that are most capable of emitting shavva radiation, which is achieved by a variety of changing means of education, or rather, spiritual mutilation, from drill in barracks to militant preaching in churches and indoctrination of children with the imperial ideal. But all of this is visible to each of us. And the invisible part is what I have already talked about in the book on the infraphysics of Shadanakar: the absorption of some human souls, or rather astrals, by Witzraor during their physical sleep and their insertion into the womb of Kaross. Awakening finds such people already with some changes in their psyche: the act is repeated for several nights, and then again and again, until the victim becomes a fiery supporter and an unconscious slave of the imperial ideology. Of course, the object always presents it as having reached a new credo through impartial and free thinking.

Mechanism of continuation of the Witzraor race, as I have already mentioned, has no analogies, even remote ones, in the human world. This process resembles more the process of budding, and nothing, similar to external fertilization, takes place here.

As soon as the offspring of Witzraor separates from the parental creature, it becomes for Witzraor not so much a offspring as a rapidly growing rival and a potential patricide. Therefore, every Witzraor strives to devour its offspring. The eternal tendency of any sovereign state to destroy the nuclei of statehood of a new state that arises spontaneously from all the movements that seek to change the existing social structure to another one is essentially nothing but a reflection in the historical mirror of these disgusting scenes played out on the underside of the world.

I would be completely misunderstood if anyone concluded from my words that the dormant tendency of tyranny in a human being is determined exclusively by the existence of Witzraors, and the destructive tendency by the existence of Velgas. Of course, these tendencies would exist and manifest themselves without them. But infraphysical predators enhance these tendencies, benefit from the real fruits of the activation of these tendencies, attract and concentrate them around themselves and within themselves.

The hierarchy that the Great Torturer already used in the first period of his struggle against the bright forces of Russia, Velga, continues to exist in Gashsharve, sometimes soaring from there and coming into collision with Witzraor. He strives to expand the dark-etheric organism of the state, she - to destroy this organism and suck its tissues into herself. He is a tyrannical builder, she is a predatory destroyer. Having satisfied herself or being defeated, she falls into a semi-sleep in her two-dimensional world, and her pulse is sustained by what can be called the etheric evaporation of human blood, inhaled by her in her sleep from torture towers, from dungeons, from scaffolds, from battlefields. This lasts until such time as, in terms of metahistory, the actions of Witzraor do not lead, against his own will, to its awakening, and in historical terms - until the tyranny of the great power does not cause a backlash: unleashing the lower instincts of the masses and breaking all prohibitions from the element of destruction.

The final liquidation of the Tatar yoke under Ivan III and the conquest of Kazan and Astrakhan under Ivan IV mark the end of the period of the First Zhrugra's life, when he created a material-human vessel that gave in Enrof the facets and forms of the flowing Cathedral Soul of the people. During this period, as mentioned, the forces of all hierarchies patronized him, and the Yetzer Hare has not yet determined the direction of his work, patiently waiting for his time.

If this being was free from the Yetzer Hare, historically it would have resulted in the fact that Russian statehood would not have surpassed itself, the state would not have turned into a predator, tormenting its own and surrounding peoples, and the monarchy would not have degenerated into tyranny.

To clarify the type of figures referred to in this book by the term "lineagers". A lineager is someone whose activity has a decisive and beneficial influence on the national destiny and the destiny of the state and who is guided in this activity by the will of the demiurge of the super-people. Entering the synclite of metaculture after death along with the righteous, geniuses, heroes, and the whole multitude of enlightened souls, the lineager exerts a tremendous, ever-increasing influence on the aspects of existence that were associated with his historical activity during his physical existence.

Lineager of Russian medieval times included Vladimir the Holy, Yaroslav the Wise, Monomakh, Alexander Nevsky, Minin, Pozharsky, Hermogenes. Dmitry Donskoy was also a lineager for some period of his life. Ivan III was partly a lineager, although the inspiration of Witzraor was already beginning to drown out the inspiration of Yarosvet in him, and the actions of this ruler turned out to be significantly distorted compared to what he should have accomplished as a lineager, as a messenger and friend of the Demiurge.

Ivan IV was also called to become a lineager. The terrible transphysical fate of Ivan the Terrible was rooted in the fact that some properties of his nature made him easily susceptible to unconscious spiritual substitutions, and unlimited power unleashed his emotions, corrupted his will, undermined his mind, and inflicted irreparable damage on his etheric body. This transformed the emanations of his individual path, or rather, his fall, into a chain of misfortunes for the super-nation and a disaster for the state.

Tracing and revealing the internal side of this process, the metahistorical and psychological one, is the task of a special monograph. However, anyone interested in this topic, even a non-specialist, can easily trace how, in Ivan, the influences of the Demiurge of the super-nation and the militant demon of great power merged and struggled, how in 1564, during his strange escape from Moscow first to Troitse, then to Alexandrovskaya Sloboda, Witzraor fully subordinated his personality to his tasks, and the terrible metamorphosis that occurred in the state's creative activity, mental state, and even in the external appearance of the king shook his surroundings. The Oprichnina was established—the nucleus of fierce tyranny, which, according to its creator's idea, had to organize the young noble class around itself, the obedient tool of a new state. One can hardly doubt that the Oprichnina was conceived only as the first stage in the transformation towards a zone of absolute tyranny over the entire country, even if it meant the extermination of entire classes and the rapid and terrifying decline of the general creative and moral level that accompanies any tyrannical system of government.

Thus was reflected in our three-dimensional world the amplification of that structure in the demonic world which is the inverted likeness of the Heavenly Kremlin and its transphysical pole; and which first manifested in the mirror of history as a demonic caricature of a monastery - the Aleksandrovskaya Sloboda - and then began to distort the Moscow Kremlin, defiling it with walls, prisons, executions, and blasphemous orgies. This black citadel was built and strengthened in Drukkarg, great Igvy created drawings of the Future, Raruggi raged, tormented by thirst for blood and spurred on by impunity; forces from that infernal realm were unleashed, which were destined to become the center of planetary forces striving to wrest the entire circle of humanity from the influence of the World of Salvaterra a few centuries later.

But the fate of tyranny is unconquerable: at a certain stage of development, tyranny comes into conflict with the interests of the state as a sum of individuals. This means that another inspiration breaks through under the inspiration of Witzraor: the will of Velgi. And if it was not difficult to understand that in the actions of Ivan IV, directed at external strengthening and internal ordering of the state structure, inspirations of the demiurge and demon of statehood were cross-breeding, and in another chain of actions aimed at turning the state into an autocratic tyranny, there was only the inspiration of one Witzraor - then the other task is somewhat more difficult: to delve into the meta-historical meaning of the side of the king's activity that did not strengthen, but undermined this state. If we delve into it, we will see who satisfied the infra-physical hunger with previously unseen streams of Gawakh - radiation of human suffering at bloody bacchanals in Novgorod and Tver, torture and countless executions in Moscow; what kind of demonic hordes were the troops of black horsemen with dog heads at their saddles; and who subdued the blinded by anger soul of the king when he struck with an iron rod his son, the heir to the throne, the hope of the dynasty.^^1

____________
^^1: It is instructive to recall a characteristic view of Ivan IV that was typical of one of the later epochs, attributing to him a tyrannical tendency and even ascribing to the Oprichnina an undoubtedly progressive role.

A subtle, intimate, deeply human warmth is brought into the burning, some sort of fiery - if one may say so - image of this king by one circumstance: the influence of the Ideal Cathedral Soul, which was obviously experienced by him in his love for his first wife - the unfortunately early deceased Anastasia. He loved this queen, according to Klyuchevsky's observation, "with some special sensitive, non-domostroyevsky love".

Naturally, the posthumous fate of such a statesman was just as catastrophic as his life. His immortal part was divided into four parts. And if he had to help shelt, for whom the daemon had not fulfilled his task, in his infinitely long path of redemption now, and a part of his being, captured by witzraor, was carried away into the stream of dark-etheric blood rushing through the tissues of the demon of autocracy, then the fourth part, the prey of Velga, could experience nothing but disintegration into dozens of tiny, flake-like, homeless shells, flitting in unimaginable deserts, on the reverse side of Russian metaculture.

Thus, Ivan IV is the brightest example of a not-so-rare type in history, the type of the lineager-tyrant, that is, a personality called to extensive cultural and state activities by a demiurge of the super-people, who brilliantly entered this arena and fell into the abyss of infra-physical layers with the steepness with which the demon of statehood raised her.

The activity of the Terrible prepared the era of the Time of Troubles - unique in its kind. Its chronicles are illuminated by fantastic reflections of mass visions, supernatural interventions, demonic invasions. If the meta-historical contemplation has prepared us for understanding such evidence as expressions of the mass spiritual experience of the super-people, we will begin to read these historical events as a cipher in which the dark poem of the general clash of hierarchies in the early 17th century is written.

## Book VIII. On the meta-history of the Kingdom of Moscow

### Chapter 1. Change of Witzraors

The Demiurge of the super-people withdraws their blessing from the Daemon of Statehood when the latter's activity is dictated solely by its black core. At the same time, the historical layer is stripped of the demiurgic envelope and the human tool of the Witzraor.

This is the formula. But a formula in which all concepts are anthropomorphized to make them commensurate with our understanding. We will have to do the same in the future. I do not know of any other ways to make my subject easy to present.

So, the loss by the King of the ability to perceive (or the right to perceive) the demiurgic envelope, and the transformation of the King into an instrument of infra-physical tyranny - that is the meaning of Alexander's Sloboda, that is, the period of Ivan the Terrible's reign for which this title is fixed.

The peculiarity of such meta-historical and historical situations is that the subjugation to the black core always and inevitably leads the Witzraor and their human tool to a simultaneous collision with both mutually opposing principles: the bright diad of the super-people and the Dingro on the one hand, and the Volga on the other. For the internal forces of anti-cosmos are torn apart by struggles and contradictions: its stable equilibrium is only a goal set by GagTungar, a goal that could only be achieved through universal tyranny.

But tyranny has its uncompromising logic. Breaking down in historical reality into numerous conduits, into thousands of human personalities, with their complex mental structure, the tyrannical tendency loses its monolithic character. The conduits themselves break out from under the control of the center, they themselves begin to torment the body of the state. It would be naive to think that the activities of Ivan the Terrible took on forms dangerous to the state only by chance. Such forms are taken on by any tyranny; moreover, they are its signs. We can trace this process both in the reign of Caligula, Nero, or Domitian, and in the era of Louis XI in France, under Genghis Khan in the East, under Aurangzeb in India, under Hitler in Germany, and so on.

Instead of strengthening the state, the Oprichnina brought only turmoil, horror, and confusion into the life of the people. And if the influence of the Veche is generally manifested in arbitrariness, sadistic cruelty, and anarchic debauchery of anti-social passions of the ruling minority, where can we look for a more vivid manifestation of these forces than in the Oprichnina?

No deeds, not even the repeal of the Oprichnina, could fix what Ivan the Terrible had done. He was no longer a man, but a soul disintegrating while still alive, incapable of moving in any direction. And when he finally, in meaningless rage, killed his heir, he retreated from him and from his degraded dynasty as a demon of statehood. It is not surprising that the last years of Ivan the Terrible's reign represent a continuous chain of failures.

Has it become clear to the demonic consciousness of Zhrugr, so far from us, that the historical version of his own tyrannical tendency threatens him with the possibility of losing even what he has already acquired? But Ui-tsraor can temporarily retreat; he is not capable of changing his fundamental tendency, just as he is not capable of expelling his own excreta.

Ioann V, the very prince whose accession to the throne was awaited with such melancholy and fear by his contemporaries, escapes from the hands of Ivan IV and begins to prepare. The prince dies at the hands of his own father, attempting to save his young pregnant wife from his lust; the enraged old man completes the murder of his son by striking his own daughter-in-law in the stomach. Then the demonic involvement of the Rurik dynasty finally comes to an end, forever. Let pious Fedor Ioannovich reign as he knows best; he will not live long anyway, nor will he rule. A new, young, strong, healthy lineage is needed - a rising lineage. No branch of the branching tree of Rurik is suitable: "patrimonial" type of thinking, special prejudices, oligarchic tendencies, spirit of rivalry, zoological attachment to what has been up to now - all this is inseparably inherent in all old boyar families. What is needed? A resolute character of a true statesman is needed. A bold and cautious mind is needed. Freedom from feudal and boyar thinking is needed. An immeasurable, but capable of hiding its ambition until the time comes, thirst for power is needed. Finally, the ability to comprehend and grasp European-scale problems is needed. In other words, what is needed is Boris Godunov.

Obstacles are removed, the way is cleared, and the principle of noble origin that has determined everything until now is paralyzed in the minds - and for the first time in the history of Russia, a rootless upstart is elevated to the throne.

No, it was too late.

It is agonizing, both for Godunov and for the whole country, to observe from a distant epoch how the demon of great power attempted to atone for the results of his own actions; how he sought to regain the help of the demiurge by advancing Boris as a personality acceptable to both sides; how such measures and state plans were instilled in Boris, which could have made the glory of any ruler. The heir to the throne, Feodor, was raised with unprecedented care and foresight; it was clear that they sought to make him not only a wise ruler but also a high-minded person worthy of becoming the progeny if a truce with the demiurge had been reached. And at the same time, the tyrannical tendency constantly broke through these endeavors, sometimes in the form of new waves of repression and executions reminiscent of the days of Ivan the Terrible, and sometimes in the legislation that made the final establishment of serfdom specifically attributable to Boris's epoch.

When in Pushkin's tragedy Tsar Boris sorrowfully gazes upon the chain of his benevolent state endeavors and their fatal failure, he - according to the poet's thought - tends to see the cause of this in the moral law that made him, the murderer of the prince, unworthy of the crown. This aberration, characteristic of those who tried to apply the norms of human morality and naively impatient demand for retribution inevitably here, in this life - to phenomena of large scale, rooted in metahistory. Don't we know many cases where immeasurably large crimes remained unpunished for the holders of power, more precisely - unpunished here, on a visible stage of their infinitely long spiritual journey? Wasn't Tamerlane, Henry VIII, Louis XIV, Stalin - all these rulers who died a natural death, at a venerable age, at the height of power, capable of at least simply understanding what torments Pushkin's Boris? - The point is, of course, different. Namely, that no actor appointed by the sovereign will receive the sanction of higher hierarchies; that the sovereign is left alone with the consequences of his tyrannical attempt during Ivan's reign.

Just as Newton, despite all his genius, could not "rise" to the ideas of the theory of relativity in the 17th century, Pushkin could not surpass the level of historical experience and metahistorical consciousness inherent in the 19th century. His genius manifested itself in the fact that he intuitively sensed the ethical nature of the conflict between Boris's intention and the curse prevailing over him. It is not surprising that the great poet, who created his work one hundred and thirty years ago, explained this conflict as a simple violation by the tsar of the moral law.

Everyone knows what led to the fact that the Godunovs were left to their own devices. And probably no one, familiar with the history of the Time of Troubles, can remain indifferent to the death of the young Tsar Feodor Borisovich. Possessing such purity of soul and nobility, so carefully brought up in anticipation of the upcoming challenges of reign, so courageous and kind, he perishes "for the sins of his father" by the hand of a sixteen-year-old boy who had just ascended the throne, and he perishes, moreover, in such a terrible way that the young warrior loses consciousness from the pain, giving his murderers the opportunity to complete their task. He dies "for the sins" not only of Boris, but also for the sins of four Ivans, three Vasils, Dmitry, Simeon, and so on - all those who wove the karma of the throne that this boy now bears. He dies because, in this epoch, the demiurge rejected everything, even good, if it came from a monarch or was used by the latter for himself. But it is also clear that the beautiful human nature and light personal karma of Feodor II protected him from posthumous karmic ties with the monarch and his fate; this bond was exhausted by his martyr's death. All the good manifested by a person, even if rejected in its immediacy by the demiurge, cannot fail to bear fruit in the spiritual afterlife of the individual. Through the limit of suffering allotted to him, Feodor passed in his mortal hour. Beyond that limit, he had to reap the beautiful fruits sown in life, and instead of the burden of reigning in Moscow, for which he was completely prepared to carry worthily, to accept the burden and joy of the corresponding path in Holy Russia.

Anticipating the course of events, I will draw attention to the fate of another figure of that era, outwardly not similar to the fate of Fedor II in almost any respect, but close to it in meta-historical meaning: the fate of Mikhail Skopin-Shuisky. The First False Dmitri tried for the last time to introduce his guide into history, choosing for this purpose a fortunate military leader, a brave statesman, a man of high morality, and a national hero. But the short chain of brilliant victories of Skopin was catastrophically interrupted at the moment when the pacification of the state seemed to be a question of the very near future: at a feast hosted by another Shuisky, an unscrupulous ambitious man who hoped to take the throne after childless Vasily IV, Skopin was offered a cup of poisoned wine by the beautiful hostess.

The death of Skopin caused an explosion of national grief, unprecedented since the death of Nevsky. The capital, cities, villages, and monasteries resounded with weeping. The outburst of sorrow united all layers of Moscow, from the Patriarch and Boyars to the urban poor. Tsar Vasily fell to the floor beside his throne, tearing his hair and clothes in desperation. Even the commander of the Swedish mercenaries, a Lutheran, kneeled before the hero's coffin, and his rough face was wet with tears. It would seem that what better evidence could one find of Skopin's being led by the Demiurge of the supra-nation, destined to become the kin of the people, savior of the country and its statehood in such a harsh hour? But, I repeat, not all bright movements of the national spirit are always caused by this hierarchy. If the vision of the Demiurge were not sharper than the vision of the masses and their leaders, if his wisdom had not already far surpassed the human, he would not be the Demiurge of the supra-nation. Something invisible to the people but known to him compelled him to withhold his blessing from Skopin, to refrain from reinforcing the hero's destiny with the shield of his sanction. Skopin's last cry for help was essentially a renunciation before Yaroslav of his tyrannical ambitions, of his past, at least for the time being. Essentially the same thing happened to Fedor II.

In spectacles like the scene of a nationwide mourning at the moment of Skopin's death, the source of a reverent feeling similar, surprisingly, to enlightening joy, is enclosed for meta-historical contemplation. Obscurity is alien to meta-historical worldview. The meta-historian does not have to doubt that great popular love and the deeds that caused it are not subject to the law of destruction, if the deeds were bright and the love justified. To the hero who has passed through the mortal hour, new and new ways of creative influence on the historical layer from top to bottom are opened. Skopin's deeds were not accepted by Yarosvet during his lifetime. But the high purpose of these deeds could not but bear fruit, and there were no more obstacles to his soul entering the synclite of metaculture. And what boundaries can be outlined, what weights can be weighed, what concepts can determine the value of the spiritual-creative contribution to the cause of Russia's salvation, to its meta-historical construction, which was accomplished by Skopin - and maybe still being accomplished now - as well as by the heroes of preceding epochs, in their transcendental existence?

But, prepared by the internal meta-history of Russia, the Time of Troubles was complicated, as is known, by the fact that a state of Poland-Lithuania was formed in the west, on the very borders and even partially on Russian soil: as young as Russia itself and also embarked on the path of militant expansion.

In connection with the presented concept, this state urges to speak about it only once, precisely now. Of course, any considerations regarding such an extensive and complex topic as the meta-history of Poland would be inappropriate here; and I have no right to them. Only one thing is absolutely necessary: to point out the existence, under the statehood of this country, in that era, of some infra-physical entity, which I dare to name without going into detail, the "witzraor" of Poland. Complex relations that linked this young and weak, but already embroiled in pretensions creature with the belligerent demon of the papacy contributed to the crystallization of a certain disposition in Polish ruling circles. It boiled down to a very emotional idea of creating a strong state on the eastern periphery of the Catholic civilization, at the expense of and against Russia. The possibility of eradicating Orthodox culture in Russia, subjugating this country to Polish statehood, and including Russians as a small and backward nation among the satellites of the Roman Catholic super-nation were portrayed as the ideal.

In search of a human personality capable of becoming its temporary instrument, the witzraor of Poland discovered in Enrof a creature still completely unknown but deeply convinced of its rights to the Russian throne and ready to form an alliance even with the devil himself to achieve this goal.

To contribute to the clarification of the question of the origin and current name of this person, meta-historical contemplation, of course, cannot. In this case, it can only lead to one thing: the discovery of a component in the stranger's being that possessed an unshakable belief in his organic connection to the dynasty that previously ruled in Russia, in his rights to the throne usurped by the pretender, and in his duty to avenge this usurper.

The iron steadfastness, not to say the maniacal nature of this idea, is in striking contradiction to the human character of False Dmitry - inconsistent, carefree, and capricious. This person could fall into petty despair and come to groundless ecstasy, could make the most frivolous plans and unconditionally surrender himself, forgetting all sensual attractions. He was capable of jeopardizing his plan for the sake of his passion for a pretty Pole, only to betray her the next day for Xenia Godunova, whom he fancied. He could represent himself with equal ease either in the crown of the emperor (not just the tsar, but specifically the emperor) or in the rags of an exile. But the idea - not even the idea, but the irrational feeling of his right to the throne, his regality, never faded in him. The last minute of his life makes a staggering impression, when he lay stretched out on the Kremlin stones, with a broken chest and a broken leg, seeing naked swords and angry faces of pursuers over him. It was precisely about the right to the throne, and only about that, that his stiffening tongue mumbled, almost incoherently.

Such duality of being is natural when it contains some foreign self, and this duality may not be realized by the carrier (some rare features are required for its realization), but the mere passive presence of this foreign component leads to catastrophic discoordination between a person's life goal and their character, between their data and their behavior. This is exactly what happened with a stranger known as False Dmitry 1. From an early age, perhaps from birth, one of the many homeless wandering shells that seek refuge in living beings crept into his personality and settled there - those shells, those fragments into which part of the Tsar's being shattered and which became prey to Velya. To avoid repeating lengthy descriptions every time I talk about them, I will henceforth use the term "micro-ego" to refer to these personality fragments.

The slain prince's confidence in his identity was obviously just an individual aberration of this person's consciousness, natural to the elementary nature of his character, foreign to any mysticism or tendency towards self-analysis. His irrational sense of his royal status demanded rational justification, vindication. And it would have been impossible to find a more plausible justification than the one that was first suggested by reason and then merged with the main idea.

Thus, the extraordinary fate of False Dmitry was determined (since it was determined by internal factors) by two factors: a fragment of the deceased tyrant's existence - and the character traits of the stranger. This disharmony led to actions that not only did not correspond to the main goal but also fatally contradicted it.

In the long series of strange - strange precisely because of their elementary nature - mistakes made by the stranger, two stand out in particular. One, of course, was his involvement with Marina, a very cunning woman but entirely lacking in political sense. It is known that it was Marina who was one of the main instigators of the conflict between False Dmitry and Moscow society; it was with her and for her that the nobility brought to Moscow the practices of the careless government of Poland, all its anarchy, arbitrariness, and its militant arrogance. False Dmitry's other mistake was his complete misunderstanding of his position in Moscow and his whole series of blunders during his reign. These blunders (starting with the pardon of Shuisky after the revelation of the first conspiracy and ending with a demonstrative disregard for all the traditions and practices of Moscow society) added fuel to the fire of the conflict until it led to catastrophe. They show once again how foreign the life idea that had seized this careless and, in essence, good-natured nature was.

The meta-historical institution that was most actively manifested in the power of Moscow society at that time was the weakened demon of great-power statehood, aside from Velga. He was still alive, and nothing but a mortal struggle between two usurpers could happen in the end of False Dmitry's reign. In order to destroy the enemy in his geographic stronghold, the Kremlin, where the forces of the Polish usurper could barely reach, Zhruit was still active enough, straining his forces. The main thing, however, was that Velga herself no longer needed her tool: by undermining central authority in the state, involving foreign forces in the country's life, and shaking up all the usual norms and authorities of the whole generation of Russians with his imposture, the stranger played his role.

Arguments that False Dmitry, with some of the qualities of his mind, stood above Moscow society of that time and that, if not for a confluence of circumstances that determined the success of the state coup in May 1606, the king could have continued the most progressive initiatives of his predecessors, are meaningless from a meta-historical point of view. No matter what his subjective intentions were, False Dmitry remained a newcomer, devoid of organic connections to Russian culture and statehood. He was not supported on his shaky throne by the hierarchies of the super-people, nor by the demon of great-power statehood, nor even by the infra-physical predator whose forces had previously helped him in the struggle for power. An incomplete year was the most natural term for the reign of such a phantom.

When a meta-historian is faced with such a range of questions as the testimonies of contemporaries about various dark wonders over the torn and disgraced body of the impostor, he is not interested in whether such facts actually occurred as they are described. However distorted the facts may have been refracted through the style of naive fantasy of the magical-religious consciousness of the era, they themselves - even exactly as they are described by contemporaries - speak of a certain meta-historical experience, experienced not by individuals, but by huge human masses and attested to by various authors. Through these images, there is a burning sense of proximity to the rampaging otherworldly forces, whose playground was the stranger. What multitudes rejoiced over his corpse on Red Square on that apocalyptic night - and why?

witzraor did not take a single particle of the deceased into his material fabric: not having power over the immortal part of his being, which fell rapidly to the bottom of Shadanakar, he sliced the rest into many parts and scattered them across the layers from Skrivnus to Drukkargar. The new minute human-made demon accurately reproduced this act in Enroth over what it had power over: the physical remains of the stranger. And the cannon, loaded with the ashes of False Dmitry, fired towards the Polish border. But this act of hatred and revenge turned out to be suicidal.

Of course, it is not easy to accept certain things not only at the level of the 17th century, but also at the level of the 20th century. Thoughts about, for example, one of Ivan the Terrible's micro-egos inhabiting the body of a stranger, poisoning his entire mental makeup, and at the same time, like some microorganisms in a nutrient medium, entering the process of swelling, may seem absurd and insane. The post-death of the stranger presented a terrifying example of the dispersion of this being not only in the physical but also in the infra-physical space, and each of these particles began a new cycle of existence, parasitically attaching to the souls of the living and giving rise to historical phenomena that other epochs did not know. For ten years, they are divided and multiplied in a peculiar progression, rapidly decreasing in terms of personality scale and scope of action. Finally, the process of fragmentation is hidden from our eyes beyond the boundary of observable layers of infra-physics, resulting in completely ghostly formations known to history only by their nicknames.

Of course, the afterlife fate of the impostor False Dmitry, who showed himself during his lifetime not only in gambling with the interests of the people and the state, but also in a number of generous actions and with all the charisma of his personality, which was fully accessible, apparently, to the ascending movement, could not be identical to the afterlife fate of the micro-ego that attached itself to him. But, whatever some personal qualities of this man may have been, his historical role - shaking the social and moral foundations of Russia - objectively realized his dark mission. The nearest stages of afterlife for all bearers of dark missions are the same: falling to the bottom. Only after centuries of staying there will the dark missions be redeemed, after which - if Gagtungar does not pull the unfortunate impostor back into Gashsharvu - a new stage begins for the impostor: redemption in the shrastra of the karmic burden that was created by the personality during its stay on earth as the head and supporter of the state. That is why the pretender is now in Drukkarge, working as a slave-stonecutter in the ranks of other prisoner-lords.

Meanwhile, around each particle of the shattering micro-ego of Grozny, there arise dark-ether vortices, soaring in waves of movements of the Cossacks, serving nobility, ruined peasantry, the declassed rabble, and the mob. A period begins when, if one can speak of anyone's power over the country, it is only the power of Velga.

Her awakening and exit from Gashsharva into the shrastr of metaculture, the funnel-shaped twists of her hissing covers, purple and black, waving over the superpeople, occur every time the power of the state demon weakens. There are even more reasons for her discovery in those cases when the tyrannical tendency of the witzraorov and their violence over millions of human fates causes the devaluation of lives and the exposure of human evil. "It is not the gods who thirst," but the great transphysical predator thirsts - one could say about such epochs.

She arose from her depths, preceded and accompanied by the very devilish hordes that the people's otherworldly experience recorded in countless fantastic stories of that time.

Sometimes it may seem that her frenzy resembles the ancient orgies of karossa: the same wildness of the unleashed element, the same surges of distant distances and depths of lust; and sometimes it is really difficult to distinguish between the historical projections of both principles. But this is only a seeming resemblance, only the result of the interweaving of these principles in a mortal struggle, because the great Destroyer threatens the Sculptress of the flesh of the people above all. The impulse of destruction and defilement, the rampage of centrifugal anti-state forces, the rolling waves of civil wars, the struggle of all against all, the involvement of foreign destructive forces in the common funnel of national chaos, the collision of the smallest differentiated particles - such is the historical projection of the transcendental deeds of Velga, who is pulling in parts the living material substance of the people, its arungviltu-prana, into the fissures of infra-physics.

This chaos erupted on the surface of history even during the reign of Vasily Shuysky. His reign was the dying convulsions of the first witzraor; it was the spasmodic, almost blind flailing of his tentacles, the tossing of his head on an unimaginably long neck, the convulsions of his body, torn apart alive by enemies.

This reign, marked by the stamp of dishonor, inferiority, and irreparable spiritual damage, from beginning to end: as is known, Shuysky was proclaimed tsar by a spontaneously gathered crowd in the square, and four years later this tsar, clutching at door jambs, was dragged out of the palace and tonsured into a monk, holding him by the hands and reciting the required lines for the ceremony.

Reflecting the immense humiliation of the witzraor, the mirror of the historical plane shows us a stunning final episode: the aged Shuysky, kissing the hand of Sigismund in Krakow, in front of the entire court and nobility, while in Polish captivity. The Russian state had not experienced such humiliation since the time of the princes' trips to the Golden Horde Khan.

What does the insignificant personality of Vasily IV mean? What does its insignificance mean? Obviously, the enveloping forces of the demon of the great power were rapidly depleting; however, it was difficult to expect another process after the rupture with the demiurge. Apparently, the situation was such that it was necessary, so to speak, to grab onto any political figure who would possess at least two properties: organic connection with the old state principle and thirst for power.

It was a sorrowful reign when Zhruhr could see how his offspring sprouted, and each of them could and wanted to devour him and take his place. They were embodied in the cores of the new statehood, which seem to historians to arise in the chaotic spontaneity of revolutionary movements. There was not enough strength left to fight, and it was necessary to call upon Poles or Swedes for help, showing foreigners the way to the very heart of the country. Moscow held only a small piece of this recently vast state. After Skopin's death and the deposition of Tsar Vasily, the life clock of the First Zhruhr was counted down. He died at that meta-historical moment which in the historical layer corresponded to the interregnum.

The creations of Zhrugra writhed around, fighting each other and hurrying to condense their dark etheric fabrics - heterogeneous clusters, mostly taking the form of factions, militias, warbands, and sometimes even gangs of robbers. It may seem not entirely understandable what I intend to say, but it is impossible to avoid this fact: the future Uitzraor had to absorb the heart of his predecessor and father, the center of his feelings and will, which had been wandering aimlessly in a state of inexpressible languor through the spaces of Kragra - the layer where the battles of Uitzraors take place - after his demonic shell had descended into the deep Upum, the world called the Eternal Rain of Grief, the Clashes and Mutual Destruction of Zhrugrites, and the Frenzies of Velg. Dingga was exhausted in the struggle with infra-physical predators. The vessel of the nation's structure was shattered. Navna rose upward with a shining mist, while below, waves of infra-physical elemental forces rose, blocking her descent into the people. The question arose about the meta-historical and material existence of the super-nation.

Meanwhile, the Uitzraor of Poland launched a new attack.

To Russia's great fortune, this witzraor, whose character was so exhaustively reflected in the senseless governance of the Polish nobility, was, if one may express it this way, his own worst enemy: unwilling to put anything above his own momentary whims, he failed to provide his human machinery with the practical means to carry out the witzraorial involution; he couldn't even choose a tool whose individual characteristics would meet the objectives at hand. Had a more strong-willed and far-sighted personality than Sigismund III been at the head of the movement, events would have taken a different turn, and a Polish dynasty would have ascended to the Moscow throne, making it difficult to predict what new historical upheavals this would have entailed.

Yet the fate of the Polish witzraor continued to rise. The Poles possessed the heart of Russia — the Kremlin, while the country continued to boil around it, seemingly headless, but still alive.

What did the terrible experience of this apocalyptic era teach Yarosvet himself? Even naively, rather than daringly, trying to make sense of this experience would be beyond us with our three-dimensional consciousness. But the equivalent that is projected into this consciousness, inevitably simplified, acquires the following approximate shape of ideas.

To achieve Yarosvet's goal on earth, to give birth to the Cathedral Soul of the super-people Zventy-Sventany from him, the super-people must grow to create a worthy material vessel; such a vessel can only be a system of governance that is immeasurably more perfect than any state. Every ruler of the Russian super-people will carry within them a distorting and destructive Eichehore. That being said, who besides the mighty Zhruhgs could protect the super-people from being enslaved by rulers of other states surrounding it? Who could ensure Karosse Dinge's reproduction of new generations of people in Russia? Who could protect Navna from the danger of being captured by foreign rulers or from its dissipation, its return to the heavenly Rangaraidr, but not as the accomplished great Cathedral I, but only as a monad, having suffered irreparable destruction in Shadanakar and forced to start its creative ascent anew, in unimaginable times, spaces, and forms? The paths to the future global brotherhood remained shrouded in impenetrable darkness. However, to avert the danger now hanging over the super-people and to ensure its further physical existence, only one option remained: to choose one of the progeny of the first Eichehore, infuse it with strength, bless it for battle against external enemies, and for centuries of existence in the future as a great state, as the only possible protection for the Cathedral Soul.

And the choice was made. The middle class - artisans, merchants, and minor clergy - turned out to be the most healthy core of the nation's structure, the most complete layer of the nation. There, ancient moral principles, the ability for heroic deeds and self-sacrifice, the will to build life and create, spiritual integrity, and purity were still preserved.

Through the great lineager of the Time of Troubles - Patriarch Germogen, the demiurge of the super-people, turned to its native layers. Germogen paid for his call with a martyr's death, but the call was picked up by the spirit of Minin. The gold and silver that flowed into the young militia, strengthening and multiplying it, became the physical resemblance of those higher forces that poured into the new ruler from the bright sources of the will and power above him: Yaroslav and Synclita of Russia. The time of a mighty outpouring into the historical layer of the will of the second demon of statehood and the demiurge himself had come, an outpouring that engulfed ever wider layers of the people, transforming the nobility, merchants, clergy, Cossacks, and peasants into participants in heroic deeds and leading the militia to Moscow under the leadership of the spirit of Pozharsky to complete the bloody all-Russian drama: the change of rulers.

When Velga, wounded by the new Zhruh, crawled away from the underground walls of Drukkarg, writhing like black curtains that had wilted and torn, back to her Gasharvu, and the ruler of Poland withdrew within his own country, licking the wounds where his severed tentacles had been, the new Zhruh absorbed the heart of the first, and a new dynasty, crowned with Yaroslav and the forces of the Christian myth, began the work of a new historical nation-building of Russia.

### Chapter 2. The Egregore of Orthodoxy and Infra-physical Fear

Hardly any honest researcher would deny the bitter fact, which is
damaging to our national self-esteem: the absence in pre-Petrine Russia of any monuments that testify to the fruitful work of analyzing and broadly generalizing thought. Strictly speaking, we cannot apply the term "thinkers" to either the Russian chroniclers, or to the church poets and writers of the 12th-16th centuries, or even to Ivan the Terrible, who demonstrated an extraordinary mental temperament in his letters to Kurbsky.

In fact, this is natural. At the early historical stages of any people, there can be no other way. If anything can hurt our self-esteem, it is the excessively prolonged - more than eight hundred years - period of cultural childhood.

Another natural feature is the extraordinary wholeness of character and, I would say, the undifferentiatedness of the inner life that was characteristic of people in those times. Russian figures of the 11th or 16th century, whether it be Alexander Nevsky or Ivan Kalita, Svyatopolk the Accursed or Malyuta Skuratov, Stefan of Perm or Nil Sorsky, Andrei Rublev or the author of "The Lay of Igor's Campaign" (since we can judge his personality by his work), seem to us like figures carved out of solid stone. Apparently, the only type of internal conflict that was well-known to these people consisted of pangs of conscience, but even for this, a catharsis was found in the form of the church, which served as a guide for the soul: repentance and as the ultimate form - monasticism.

This is natural because until the second half of the 16th century, historical experience did not confront the Russian consciousness with insoluble contradictions of thought and spirit, did not give reason to delve into the abyss of ethical or religious dualism. The struggle against the Tatars was a struggle against a specific, open, clearly defined, all-national enemy; such a struggle could only contribute to the development of a whole and strong character, like flint. The collision of the Christian myth with pre-Rus' paganism was hardly even realized as a deep spiritual conflict by contemporaries of Yuri Dolgoruky or Vasily the Dark. Rather, it was a kind of syncretism - a stable, not entirely clearly understood household ambivalence, which was only not shared by a small number of extreme social groups: the monasticism.

The first historical figure to announce the transition to another level was Ivan the Terrible; it is understandable that such a figure, having been raised to the ultimate height of state power, so to speak, for everyone to see, could not fail to produce on contemporaries an impression of stunning, terrifying, and even, perhaps, daunting. But Ivan the Terrible was followed by the Time of Troubles with all the nakedness of the collision of meta-historical forces - the Troubles that sucked in all layers of the super-people into its apocalypse. These years became a turning point in the development of Russian consciousness.

As a result of the meta-historical experience of these years, a certain common attitude has formed in the broad popular strata, the same one that, in its logical development, led to the great church schism.

The cruel traumatization of the popular psyche by the calamities of the Time of Troubles and their trans-physical foundation could only be overcome with the change of several generations. The breath of anti-cosmos, which burned contemporaries of Ivan the Terrible and False Dmitry, was too evident and burning. For the first time in its history, the people experienced the proximity of death, not from the hands of an open, external enemy, like the Tatars, but from incomprehensible forces lurking within themselves and opening the gates to the external enemy - forces that were irrational, mysterious, and even more frightening. Russia for the first time felt the abysses that surrounded not only its physical but also its spiritual existence. Unprecedented crimes committed with impunity by heads of state, their mental tragedies exposed to everyone, conflicts of their conscience, their insane horror before the afterlife retribution, the ephemerality of royal greatness, the fragility of all undertakings on which there was no sense of divine blessing, mass visions of light and dark forces fighting for something sacred, fundamental, and inviolable in the people, perhaps for some divine essence of it - such was the atmosphere of the country from the childhood of Ivan the Terrible to the childhood of Peter the Great. Sharp vigilance, distrust, and suspicion of everything new and untested were natural and logical at that time. In order to be able to perceive and come to terms with such a cultural revolution as Peter's revolution, the people had to step away from the Time of Troubles for a whole century.

Yes: without the too early and too violent manifestation of the tyrannical tendency of the first reforms of Peter, they would have been internally possible a century earlier. Personally, I even think that the bright mission of Ivan IV, only a small part of which he was able to accomplish, consisted in preparing, creating conditions specifically for broad reforms aimed at internal rapprochement with other Christian cultures. But the thing is that Russia not only did not need to rush to the West during this period, but its historical movement in the 16th-17th centuries being slow could also have a providential meaning. If the overthrow of Peter's orientation had been made in the 16th century (and with the absolute monarchy of Moscow rulers, starting with Ivan the Terrible, this could have happened if a legitimate ruler of the type and scale of Peter were on the throne), then this revolution could have distorted the meta-historical and historical paths of Russia. The people were still too spiritually naive, too weakened by the Tatar yoke, too unhardened in the struggle against infra-physical temptations. Europeanization, which would have flooded into the Russian cultural zone, could have flooded the centers of national-Russian spirituality, stifling weak sprouts of original Russian culture under the silt of foreign, more advanced material civilization. They needed to be allowed to strengthen, the country needed to be passed through the crucible of satanic temptations - since they are inevitable anyway - but at the same time, it was necessary to force the tempting forces to limit themselves to temptations that the people could handle, and not to such temptations as the seductions of highly intellectual and ethically low Catholicism of the Inquisition era, on the one hand, or the seductions of the irreligious era, into which Western Europe was already preparing to enter, on the other hand. Russia was destined for a unique and irreplaceable role, a mission of global significance was being prepared within it and over it. And the implementation of this mission would have been doomed in advance if an unconsolidated culture, a spiritually unhardened people, an unprepared country were drawn into the orbit of more mature metacultures of the West, that is, turned into one of many nations of Catholic or North-Western culture.

The demiurges of superpeoples are not the highest meta-historical institution. There are others. There is Gridrutva, the White Abode, where the enlightened ones, rising from the depths of the Synclite of the World, together create the spiritual plan of human ascent; there is the Synclite of Humanity, there is the Elite of Shadanakar, there is the World Salvatorra. The bottomless deep designs of these institutions are only partially revealed after centuries have passed. Then the second, deepest layer of teleology begins to shine through, only the elusive, partial reflections of which become the teleological plans of all the demiurges of humanity - creations of great, but still limited plans, imperfect or too narrow in all their splendor, not all-encompassing, not having thought of everything.

So, the Time of Troubles brought the people out of a state of infancy. It gave them a meta-historical experience that enriched them. But mastering this experience took a long time; it has not been fully mastered, as is evident to this day. The seventeenth century stands entirely under the sign of this assimilation, this transition from childhood to youth. Under the sign of this assimilation - and at the same time under the sign of a new factor that complicated the process and gave it a unique form.

The cases are well-known in world meta-history when militant egregores arose over religious communities. The vigorously manifested expansionist and even vampiric tendencies, especially if they merged closely with the religious-community worldview itself, are the best evidence of a strong religious egregore, actively demonized by Hagtungor and turning from a simple, inevitable obstacle to the Providential process of meta-history into a conscious and deliberate enemy of it. It is enough to recall the history of Judaism or the bloody expansion of early Islam.

We have already discussed the enormous and, moreover, happiest significance for Russia, which was embodied in the personal decision of Prince Vladimir the Great regarding the state religion. Now it is necessary to recall that it was precisely the religion that Vladimir was attracted to Rus, which, according to its almost thousand-year tradition and the circumstances of its formation in the cultural centers of Byzantium near the imperial throne, remained alien to the extreme theocratic tendency. Compared to the egregores of Islam or Calvinism, and even more so with the monsters that emerged behind Judaism and the papacy, the egregore of Russian Orthodoxy was oblique, amorphous, non-aggressive, and weak. The church has long taken the position of a spiritual ally of the state, later turned into an assistant, then into a servant, and under the Third Zhrugr, into a slave and only once tried to assert its claim to the supreme all-state role. However sad this descent of the church down the stairs of subordination to the state may be from a religious-cultural, and even more so from a confessional-Orthodox point of view, it is still the lesser of two evils if compared to the opposite extreme.

The dark-etheric egregore strengthened over the Russian Orthodox Church based on the psychological climate that developed in the country as a result of the struggle against the Tatars and the establishment of a nationalist-autocratic government. The egregore was formed from the emanations of the human multitude associated with the church, which were contributed by any soul that had not achieved righteousness and mixed with emanations of "worldly care" in addition to reverence, humility, and love. The fatal circumstance contributing to the growth of the egregore was the characteristics of medieval semi-magical piety that compelled believers to make enormous contributions to monasteries for the commemoration of the dead, princes to donate colossal estates to monasteries, and monks to take it all for granted. The excessive enrichment of monasteries, the decline of monasticism and the clergy, in general, provided fertile ground for the dark-etheric growth on the body of the church. This hazy club, this stirring mist, thickened at the foot of its cathedral metetheric summit, apparently identifying itself with the church's consciousness. The threat of its swelling appeared as if the emergence of an invisible barrier between the soul of the believer and the transphysical essence of the church to which this soul aspired. Therefore, no matter how vaguely the believer sensed the nature of this danger, it must have seemed even more ominous than the vampiric tendency of Zhurgrov.

The Church, of course, did not remain indifferent to this threatening phenomenon; and the historical expression of the two main struggling tendencies within it - the Egregorial and Providential - is manifested in the 16th century clash of supporters and opponents of large monastic land ownership, with the most vivid representatives of both trends being Nil Sorsky and Joseph Volotsky. The Cathedral of 1503 and the heated literary controversy became an open form and arena for this struggle. It is noteworthy that the leader of the opponents of land ownership turned out to be Nil Sorsky himself, a man with a delicate spiritual organization, a true poet of the life of the Skete, a bearer of genuine sanctity, in the full sense of the word - a vessel of spirituality. It was not the excitement of "historical feeling", which Nil Sorsky, like almost all Orthodox ascetics, was deprived of, but a profound transfysical concern for the Church that brought him out of seclusion and urged him to fight the Josephites. However, although the Church subsequently canonized him as a saint - it was simply impossible not to do this in relation to the memory of one of the greatest Russian righteous people - victory remained with the Josephites, and thus the Egregor of Orthodoxy preserved for itself the soil that created its nourishing dark etheric environment. The results were more than evident a century later, soon after the Time of Troubles.

By carrying out his church reforms, almost exclusively focused on liturgical and textual issues, Patriarch Nikon remained, of course, an exponent of the will of the church as a whole. However, when he became a contender for the predominant position in the state, seeking to subordinate the royal throne to the patriarchal see, he became - no matter what his subjective intentions were - a direct expression of the will of the parasitic, dark-etheric entity that was feeding on the body of the church, which we are talking about.

The defeat of him and his inspirer was due not only to the greater power of the demon of statism, but also to the greater epochal-historical justification of their actions. This rightness of Nikon's was apparently felt by wide popular strata. If the purely liturgical reforms of Nikon had already provoked such a strong opposing movement that the constructive forms of the Old Believers, into which it had flowed, had survived to this day, then his attempt at a theocratic, or rather hierocratic, revolution must have frightened even wider strata, including the overwhelming majority of the church hierarchy, on whom such a revolution would have imposed an immeasurable, strange, incomprehensible, and therefore unfulfillable responsibility.

Nikon's papal aspirations were reminiscent of the vaguely familiar spirit of tyranny that had so terribly burned Russian society under Ivan the Terrible and had already died out under Boris at the end of his reign. Everyone remembered too well what suffering it brought and into what abysses it led; and the fact that now the danger came not from the demon of statism, but from something ominously unclear that had formed within the church itself only increased the irrational, transphysical fear.

Hierocratic ambitions of Nikon were stopped, but the otherworldly fear could not be eradicated by this alone. From it grew the schism, permeated with this terror of the "prince of this world", as if he had come into the world and managed to build his nest in the holiest of holies of humanity, in the church. Hence, the classlessness or extraclassness of the schism, to which people of any status or estate joined, if only this infraphysical fear was born in their hearts. Hence, the frantic intolerance of Avvakum, his vehement denial of any possibility of compromise, and his passionate thirst for a martyr's end. Hence, the uncompromising ruthlessness of the schismatics, ready, in the event of a church-political victory, to pile up hecatombs of the bodies of "children of Satan". Hence, also the burning, impatient thirst for deliverance, final salvation, the demand for the end of the world, which is so difficult to understand for people of other epochs. And hence, finally, that unparalleled heroism of bodily self-destruction, which puts us at a dead end when we delve into the history of mass self-immolations, if we are alien to meta-historical contemplation to any degree, and which shakes us to the deepest tremor if such a kind of contemplation has opened up to us the nature of these amazing phenomena.

Nikon was exiled, he died, but the church sanctioned his reforms; decades passed, and there was no turning back to the ancient faith, not even a hint of it. And when the demiurge, carrying out his universal plan, brought forth such a colossus as Peter; when the Second Zhrugr enveloped him with all his youthful power; when, on behalf of the reforming tsar, the state gave the church a small corner in the empire, subordinating religion to its interests and narrowing the limits of the people's spiritual creativity - then the schism acquired a concrete face on which its otherworldly terror and hatred were concentrated. Peter I was declared the Antichrist.

In vain do we wonder at the pettiness of purely formal, by no means dogmatic, discrepancies between Old Believers and Nikonians; from the point of view of the consciousness of the 17th century, half-magical and yet not afraid of extreme conclusions, the spirit of antichrist was by no means bound to manifest itself necessarily in rebellion against the Symbol of faith or in the physical extermination of the religious community. This spirit was represented as the offspring of the "father of lies", beginning with secondary external substitutions and descending on their ladder the apprehensible soul into the abyss of the anticosmos. And if we cannot feel sympathy for the heroes of the Schism in their ideological direction or in their methodology, we can understand and sympathize with the great spiritual turmoil that the Schism caused.

Of course, the Orthodox egregore will receive due resistance from this side and the danger has disappeared. True, of course, is also the fact that such inspirers stood behind Peter, and the path charted by this tsar revealed such perspectives that the idea of the Third Rome could have seemed like provincialism. But this impending future promised, at the same time, a chain of such changes or substitutions, gaped by such uncharted abysses, and from the recent past still shone the warning lights of the Time of Troubles, that the spirit involuntarily recoiled backwards, into the spiritually reliable, centuries-old forms of antiquity, which provided salvation for countless legions of souls - ancestors and forefathers.

Thus, in the 16th century, a spiritual process of extreme importance began to emerge, which was defined in the 17th century. This process can be outlined by the following complementary definitions:

a) as the disintegration of the primary unity of the soul structure;
b) as the dialectically inevitable passage through a prolonged stage of internal disharmony;
c) as the development of the ability to contemplate opposite spiritual depths simultaneously;
d) as the cultural and transphysical expansion of the individual's boundaries;
e) as the struggle of thought to comprehend the meta-historical experience.

It would be a sign of complete helplessness and inability to penetrate the essence of cultural and historical processes to assume that this spiritual process has been interrupted, extinguished, or confined to Old Believers. On the contrary, all religious philosophy and historiosophy of the 19th century, from Chaadaev and the Slavophiles to Vladimir Soloviev, Merezhkovsky, and Sergei Bulgakov, all the inner conflict, all contemplation and emotional experience of both spiritual poles, characteristic of Lermontov and Gogol, and even more so of Dostoevsky, Vrubel, and finally, Blok, are nothing but stages of this process.

Let's examine this in more detail. The disintegration of the primary unity of the soul structure reached such depth in the 19th century that even Pushkin's personality, who was full of contradictions and had evolved through opposing religious and political beliefs, seems to us to be relatively integrated compared to the spiritual image of his contemporaries and descendants.

Under the sign of internal disharmony, almost all cultural creativity of the 19th century was situated. Only towards the end of the century did one of the ways to overcome it begin to emerge - an overcoming, however, that was damaging and fraught with even deeper catastrophes - both in terms of general history and the personal eschatology, i.e. the afterlife fate of human souls. Here, I mean the colossal movement whose roots are embodied in the figures of Plekhanov and Lenin.

The ability to simultaneously contemplate opposite spiritual depths turned out to be nothing more than a manifestation in the spiritual sphere of the innate Russian capacity for unlimited expansion that corresponded to the new cultural age of the nation. This same expansiveness, which in the times of primitive and cohesive nature was expressed psychologically - in the unity of the soul's disposition with the breadth of boundless forests and steppes, emotionally - in heroic courage, and historically - in the creation of a monolithic state from the Baltic to the Pacific Ocean. The Pechorins and Pierre Bezukhovs, the Stavrogins and Ivan Karamazovs, the heroes of "The Enchanted Wanderer" and "Crime and Punishment" - the grandchildren of pioneers and oprichniks, monks and bandits, Cossack atamans and schismatics who burned themselves - only had different cultural ages and therefore different spheres of expansion.

This led to a cultural and transphysical expansion of the limits of personality - a fact too obvious to require any illustrations or comments.

As for the struggle of thoughts to comprehend the meta-historical experience, essentially all outstanding Russian minds of the 19th century were engaged in it, despite the fact that the concept of meta-history remained undefined and even unconscious. Isn't there an effort in Belinsky's musings on the new Russian literature to read history as a system of visible signs of some invisible spiritual process? Don't the masses and their leaders become manifestations and even instruments of transcendent forces in Leo Tolstoy's incomparable historical epic? Doesn't this otherworldly light flicker continuously in Dostoevsky's historical concepts, transforming historical perspectives into shifted, overturned, strange, and captivating perspectives of meta-history? Will anyone deny this spiritual perspective on the national past in Surikov's canvases and Mussorgsky's folk dramas? - I limit myself to mentioning only the luminaries of the 19th century; listing lesser names would require a separate chapter.

So, all five characteristics of the analyzed process that I mentioned earlier on the page are present. We see that the process, which originated in ancient times during the oprichnina, is a process of experiencing both poles of the transphysical world, understanding them, and interpreting them, moving from phase to phase until it reaches the heights of genius artistic generalizations and philosophical intuitions by the 20th century. I don't think there's a need to explain that the events of the 20th century should deepen this process, bring internal disharmony to the extreme, and prepare for the phase of some synthesis for future generations, given the conflicting concepts and emotional intensity of polarizing ideas.

In this sense, we cannot help but feel like blood descendants of those who performed the feat of self-immolation 250 years ago, which is now almost inaccessible to us; and those who, in the following decades, created the legend of the invisible city of Kitezh.

All of this created the prerequisites for the crystallization of this legend precisely during the schism. Naturally, it was in the remote forests of the Volga region, traditionally illuminated by the lamps of skete life of the servants of God, where this tale placed the city of the righteous on the banks of the Svetloyar. Its connection with the outside world is made through the city of Small Kitezh, located on the border of the steppes, which is a symbol of the historical church with its human weaknesses: that historical church whose true spiritual essence is hidden from seeking souls, obscured and distorted by the hazy, dense, and sensual Orthodox egregore. Under the sudden attack of an external enemy, the historical church is destroyed "without a fight, with great shame." But, of course, not all of it perishes: the virgin Fevronia, the embodiment of the Ideal Soul, surrounded by the poetry that can emanate only from Nav, enters Great Kitezh through her martyrdom. Great Kitezh ^^1 is physically defenseless: its small army of heroes receives the crown of martyrdom in the battle above Kerzhentse. Then, in response to the fervent prayer of the entire people before the Great Intercessor, the city mysteriously sinks to the bottom of Svetloyar, "into eternal life" - it transitions into a different sphere of existence.

____________
^^1: I'm here trying to point out the meta-historical meaning of Rimsky-Korsakov's musical mystery as the highest (so far) stage in the development of this amazing legend.

The legend reflected, in a transformed way, the essence of the schism as it was depicted by its best dreamers, contemplators, and "poets of the heart." It idealized reality to the point of being unrecognizable, yes; but in doing so, it gave an image that was infinitely deeper, more enduring, and more universal than the historical phenomenon of the schism: the mystery of a people, a culture, or an individual soul, whose inviolable inner sanctum, guarded by the hierarchies of the Light, remains inaccessible to any, even the most powerful enemy, retreating into a mysterious spiritual depth from any intrusion, from any hostile touch.

### Chapter 3. Filling the Space between Cultures

What impulses created that giant geographic whole, that strange conglomeration of deserts, tundra, highly populated fertile regions, enormous cities, and vast taiga, which, in general terms, coincided with the borders of the Russian super-nation?

Asking such a question, one cannot but recall certain epochs of world history, when a people or super-nation transitioned from a state of geographic isolation to a state of rapid expansion.

Historical science has put forth a number of clever ideas about the geographic, socio-political, and especially economic reasons for such phenomena. However, one can doubt whether it was only the lack of arable land that pushed the Arabs, who for centuries had subsisted as scattered tribes on their peninsula, towards the stunningly rapid unification and dizzying expansion; an expansion resembling a spring uncoiling, a lava flow from a crater, a hurricane; an expansion that did not think to stop at the conquest of neighboring rich and fertile lands, but within a mere fifty years had overwhelmed the territory from Guadalcázar to India.

It is permissible to ask the question: why, in the end, did the economy develop in such an unprecedented and amazing way on the threshold of the 16th century in Western Europe, that for the first time in human history, two super-nations - the Roman Catholic and the Northwest - conquered the ocean, flooded America, pulled Africa into their orbit, opened and partially subjugated the ancient cultures of the East to their civilization? Remaining within the framework of economic and socio-political motivations, we will have to shrug our shoulders and raise our hands to the simple question: why did the socio-economic conjuncture, which caused this expansion, only occur once and in one place throughout the history of numerous cultures of humanity? And if such a conjuncture arose anywhere else, for example in China, why did it not produce the same results? - It turns out that it is not wrong to keep a share of opinion in the exhaustive power of socio-economic explanations and even to suspect the existence of some factor in such historical phenomena that is not covered by the network of historical causality - an irrational factor.

This doubt and suspicion turn into a huge question mark, since the matter concerns the problem of Russian expansion to the East in the late 16th and 17th centuries.

The 17th century in general posed many mysteries to historical thought, and one of the deepest ones is as follows: why and for what exactly, prompted by what socio-economic reasons, did the Russian people, already extremely sparse on the vast, uninhabited East European plain, with the efforts not of the state, but exclusively of private individuals, flood the space, three times larger than the territory of their homeland, with something that is harsh, cold, uncomfortable, almost uninhabitable, rich only in furs and fish, and in the next century, crossed the Bering Sea and reached California?

Of course, the intensifying exploitation of serfs threw thousands of people onto the eastern, unsettled outskirts, where they had to seek means of survival. But weren't the Urals and Western Siberia extensive enough to accommodate and feed a population tens of times larger than the Cossack troops that crossed the Stone Belt during the reigns of Ivan the Terrible, Boris Godunov, or Alexei Mikhailovich? Why didn't these peasants (who, in the overwhelming majority, became Cossacks) engage in their usual work on new fertile lands and instead turn to hunting, a pursuit that placed them, due to the conditions of selling their products, in heavy dependence on merchants and the state? The people fled from the oppression of the landlords. Yes, they fled. But why couldn't they stop and settle firmly on the Ob, Irtysh, or Angara rivers, where there were no landlords and where it was necessary to run further and further away, not from a pursuit that did not exist, but from someone unknown, for unknown reasons, and to unknown places, into an endless wilderness, across giant rivers and impassable taiga, through regions inhabited by foreigners who offered resistance, and finally reaching the Pacific Ocean, not even finding peace there, but jumping to America?

Russian Cossacks, they say, were attracted by the abundance of game and fish in the Far East. Yes, they were. But it wasn't just the Russians who knew that fish was a tasty thing; not only the Russians wore furs and traded them. Why then, strange as it may seem, did these very riches not attract, for example, the Chinese, who lived much closer to them, were undoubtedly more advanced in the cultural sense in the 17th century, and suffered from overcrowding in their own country?

All of these questions, which naturally arise even on a school bench, cannot be answered because the factors that modern science deals with do not allow for such an answer to be obtained. The factor that contains this answer remains outside its field of vision. This is the same factor that, in its deliberately simplified understanding, is commonly contemptuously referred to as psychological, and without taking it into account, all of history becomes not only a dead scheme, but also a direct falsification of science - a falsification that covers up its inability to answer elementary questions either with dogmatic rhetoric or by pretending not to notice these questions.

Let's not be afraid of words. Yes, the excess of physical strength and the courage of the national spirit, in which the desire to go further and further is awakened with still intact internal integrity, is a manifestation of this irrational factor in the epoch we are examining in psychological terms.

What is this irresistible call that drove explorers further and further? What is this incomprehensible instinct (let's use this mysterious term, more enigmatic than "ether" in the physics of the recent past)?

But there is no need to imagine the involtation of the demiurge necessarily in the form of a dizzying enlightenment or a stream of dazzling images. On the contrary, such a form of involtation - or inspiration - is far from common. It presupposes a developed personality, a bright individuality, even a certain specific talent that is partly close to the artistic, but not identical to it: rather, it is one of the forms of religious talent. The demiurgic involtation of the "mass man," however, knows completely different ways. In such a soul, the demiurge does not rage like a storm; he does not inspire such a mind with any huge ideas, does not open up cosmic panoramas or ethical horizons to such a soul. He does something else: he rises from the depths of the soul with an unconscious, terrifying, and irrefutable call of the unconscious.

The voices of the Unconscious speak to the masses and other authorities: karossa, wwitzraor, the Cathedral Soul of the people, even Velga. These voices can only be distinguished by the nature of the feelings they awaken and the actions they inspire.

And the actions that were inspired in the pioneers were reduced to one - only one, but great: to capture and secure the grand spatial reserves for the Russian super-nation, all the empty territory between the existing cultures on earth, using the power of several hundred heroes. No Cossack, no hero of Siberian conquests, of course, could even remotely understand this. Before each caravan, there was not this common historical goal, but a small, private, concrete one: to fight for one's existence by heading east for mountain gold, squirrel fur, and sable. All of this was plentiful in the already captured places, but for some reason, it was impossible to stop. This was hindered by the wild smells from unknown eastern wastelands, striking the nostrils and intoxicating like wine. This was hindered by the cranes' cries, the trumpeting clicks of the deer - tense, passionate, free voices of the animal world. This was hindered by the bluish haze that obscured the dense forest horizon to the east. This was hindered by homeless overnight stays, campfires, faces, and stories of comrades, songs, and remote life. Even the sun itself hindered this, rising over the mysterious eastern expanses as if silently indicating the way and the goal. But most of all, their own blood hindered this, teaching them to understand the voices of the wind and sun, animals and birds in just this way - blood that roared through their veins with a powerful call into the distance, with an irrational and providential intoxication of wandering.

Someone will say, "This isn't even psychology, it's just poetry!" But then again, is historical science superior to poetry, so as to allow itself to look down on it? And if they are equivalent, if they should fertilize each other, then not only the history of poetry is logical, but also the poetry of history. Moreover, one should not be ironic about the poetic element in history to someone who, without the help of this element, could not answer the questions posed to them with anything but verbal prancing around them or embarrassed silence.

It is noteworthy that the demon of statism remained aloof from the movement of the pioneers for a long time. This is evident, at least, from the indifference with which the Russian state looked upon the occupation by the Russian people of vast lands in the East. When this movement began, the first Zhruhr was absorbed by another: the sanction of the demiurge was lost, and the very existence of the Uitzraor was nearing its end. There was no time for Siberia then. The second Zhruhr, during all three centuries of its existence, saw the expanses of Asia only as a secondary item of state enrichment. It is remarkable that up to the 20th century, it still did not understand why history and its own people burdened it with Siberia and the Far East. And when the fur trade ceased to play a significant role in state revenues, Siberia became a place of exile, and Russian America was sold. What would Peter the Great, that great shipbuilder and lover of the sea, have said if he could have known that two hundred years later, in 1925, his successors still would not have a military, and essentially, a civilian fleet in the Pacific Ocean? And Peter unconsciously understood more than the demon of statism. He understood, for example, that it was necessary to carry out such a grand enterprise as the Great Northern Expedition for something (it is not clear why, exactly). No European monarch in the 17th, 18th, or even 19th century conceived or carried out a similar enterprise. However, there is no evidence to suggest that Peter clearly understood the meaning and purpose of such an enterprise. In any case, the colossal expenses it required could not be offset by insignificant economic benefits, even if Russian ships had managed to break through to India through the Arctic Ocean. And Peter did not like to waste money on projects that did not promise significant state benefits. But the point is that Peter the Great, as I will try to show in the next chapter, was not only a conduit for the will of the demon of statism: through him, more than through any other Russian monarch of modern times, the demiurge led, and if we refuse to see the fruits of his inspiration in a whole series of Peter's actions, we will understand nothing in Russian history of the last centuries.

So, the excitement of the demiurge was clearly reflected in the occupation of Russian North Asian spaces, vast and almost empty. But why was he in such a hurry to expedite this process? To prevent others from taking over? But who? China? But until the 20th century, China could not properly master even Manchuria. England? But Siberia did not attract England before or after. Japan, the United States? But the expansion of these states only began at the turn of the 20th century.

We cannot know what evil the demiurge was trying to avoid by hastening the consolidation of these territories for his super-ethnic group. Did he anticipate the possibility of their capture by some foreign conqueror? Or was the possibility of the formation of an independent state in Siberia not excluded, a strong one capable of defense and offense, which would entail a chain of additional difficulties, sacrifices, and bloodshed? All of this is speculation that does not rely on any meta-historical experience, and therefore is devoid of any value.

But it is quite obvious that Yarosvet attached special significance to the transformation of Russia from a peripheral East European country into a great Eurasian power, filling all the empty space between the North-Western, Roman Catholic, Muslim, Indian and Far Eastern cultures (that is, between almost all cultures currently in existence). It can be surmised that this was related to the world-historical destiny of Russia and that these spatial reserves were to serve as a stage for the creative actions of the super-nation, witnessed by the 21st or 22nd century. A culture that is called upon to grow into an interculture can only fulfill its destiny by closely touching all the cultures that it must assimilate, unite, and transform into planetary unity. If the super-nation is destined to become a reactive agent, transforming itself and all the super-nations of the world into a spiritually unified humanity, then spaces corresponding to the scope of its struggle, its ideas, and creative work must be reserved for it.

### Chapter 4. Lineager Peter and the Demonic Distortion of His Mission

Among the mysteries posed by 17th century historical thought, a significant place is occupied by the strange fact of the birth, specifically in the royal family, as the royal son, of a person who, in his spiritual scope, talents, mind, character, and even physical temperament, precisely corresponded to the ideal image of a statesman demanded by Russia, its meta-culture, its mission, and its fate.

The birth of individuals of such caliber is counted in units of hundreds of millions of births. According to probability theory, the chances that such a person would be a prince are close to zero.

Meanwhile, in the conditions of the 17th century, a revolution like Peter's could only be carried out by a great state genius with one necessary, but essential condition: the legality of his power in the eyes of contemporaries. The much more modest undertakings of Boris and False Dmitry, aimed at bringing Russia closer to the West, were not forgiven by Russians, neither of them, and served as one of the reasons for these two premature deaths. Of course, the scale of the state mind of these two rulers is far inferior to the genius of Peter, but no usurper, even if he were as brilliant as Peter, could have overturned centuries-old social norms in a society still fully imbued with the ancient idea of the right of lineage to power.

However, the science of the present day, dogmatically denying the teleology of history, has to bypass this fact in silence. As always in such cases, it pretends that questions of this kind are meaningless. It perfectly understands that with an exclusively causal approach to phenomena, it will not be able to utter a single sound in explanation of this fact.

The situation of a modern historian - a historian in the proper sense of the word - is entirely natural. The application of the teleological principle to historical facts is impossible for him, and indeed, what methodology would allow him to approach facts with the question of "why"? From the steep shore of this question, he sees nothing but an endless sea of fantasy.

But meta-history does not need to limit its possibilities to the boundaries outlined by a causal approach. For him - from the steepness of the question "why" - another reality opens up, not of fantasy, but of a second reality. He does not intend to fetishize causality and approaches many problems from a teleological perspective, particularly regarding the dependence of character and abilities on the conditions of birth and childhood. If the historian does not want to see a fundamental difference between playing with fantasy and the meta-historical method, we will not at least deprive him of the consolation he will derive from the idea that sitting in the cage of causality is the ultimate and most brilliant achievement on the path of knowledge.

Apparently, the preparatory work of the demiurge and the Kaross of Digna on the ether-physical form or rather, the apparatus that would be capable of containing such a colossal involution and carrying out its tasks, began a long time ago - several generations in the lineage of the Tsarevich's father and his mother's lineage. The process of this preparation is, of course, beyond the field of view of meta-history; he only sees the possibility of tracing its very end - the providence of the circumstances of Peter's childhood and youth, which recreated his personality.

The tasks of the transformer were supposed to require tremendous physical effort from him. And Peter's childhood in the village of Preobrazhenskoye, taking him out of the hothouse atmosphere of the palace, where both of his brothers had grown fat, hardened his body and provided an opportunity for any physical exercises, including those that seemed completely inappropriate for a prince to his contemporaries.

The future reformer will need the greatest independence of mind, a habit of not relying on authorities, and independent thinking. And no one is allowed into his circle in childhood or adolescence who is intellectually and willfully capable of even temporarily replacing the boy's independent mental work with blind trust in authority.

The incredible tasks of ruling will require from him unprecedented, monstrous, and almost impossible forms of behavior. He will have to shed his royal garb and, rolling up his sleeves, set an example for carpenters, shipbuilders, blacksmiths, carpenters, and masters of various crafts. And in Preobrazhenskoye itself, there are conditions that fully meet the needs of the future king - not only to get used to such work but also to practically study some of them.

Instead of the boyars, he will have to find talented people of different backgrounds and create a new army that meets the needs of the coming days, which is unknown how and from where. And the boys from the common people, clever, loyal, and brave, become his playmates in Preobrazhenskoye - the core of the future guard.

The stern duty of a revolutionary on the throne requires from him uncompromising attitude towards the enemies of his state ideology. And his heart is hardened from an early age by such spectacles as bloody Streltsy uprisings and executions, and by such human relationships as his relationship with Princess Sophia. If an ordinary child, not nurtured by any meta-historical forces, were surrounded by all these conditions, nothing exceptional would have come out of him. But with innate genius, that is, with the previously developed ability to perceive inspiration sent to him by his daemon, - the conditions of the village of Preobrazhenskoye reshaped and polished this human tool.

Such teleological considerations could be applied to the biography of any person belonging to the category of the chosen, geniuses, and righteous, provided that we have sufficient biographical information at our disposal.

So what was Peter the Great's historical task, as indicated by the demiurge? To what extent can we separate this task from the influence of the historical environment in Peter's personality and actions, and to what extent is it expressible in human concepts? This task is outlined in the following way:

Russia is destined for a universal mission, the meaning of which is not known to the emperor. He must only be sure of one thing: its global character. His personal task is to turn the super-nationality towards a path leading from stagnation in national isolation to the vastness of universal development. At the same time, the Russian people should be brought into the circle of advanced nations not as someone's satellite or junior historical partner, but as a great power that other nations will have to take seriously from the very beginning.

This turn is possible only if Russia objectively adopts the advanced principles of the neighboring, older culture, because this culture is one of two that managed to dissolve the aristocratic and local isolation within itself - with respect to the rest of the world. For this same revolution to be realized and its results be strong, a complete transformation from within is required: it will abolish the nobility as a ruling group that has demonstrated its inability to meet historical challenges, and will transfer the leading role to the nobility and the middle class.

Why not to the clergy or the peasantry? Not to the clergy, because the dominance of this class in the state would lead to the triumph of the egrigor of Orthodoxy and ultimately to hierarchical despotism, the most pernicious of all despotisms. And not to the peasantry, because the peasantry was the most backward of all classes and it would have to receive assistance for centuries before it could play a positive role in state and social creativity.

It is impossible to give a detailed consideration of the question of how much Peter's historical activity corresponded to this task. But it is possible and necessary to point out the meaning of the second envelopment, as if it were interwoven between the envelopment of the demiurge and the personality of the emperor, giving the latter's activity a character that did not always and not entirely correspond to the desires of Yaroslav.

This envelopment of the demon of statehood addressed certain properties of Peter's character and temperament, and in some cases - to the properties of his reasoning. At the same time, it distorted the course of his thought and actions to the extent that this course was not free from the influence of these very traits of character, temperament, and reasoning.

Zhruhr worked hard to introduce his tyrannical tendency into the ruling ideology. He managed to transform the stern hardness necessary and inevitable in Peter's position into inflexibility, internal freedom from authority - into ferocious anger towards all authorities of the past, straightforward dedication to his idea - into hatred of everything that seemed useless to him, i.e. that could not be turned to the benefit of his idea, and the natural spontaneity - into uncontrolled sensuality and immoderate coarseness. Irony turned into a tendency to ridicule. Utilitarian thinking emptied the aesthetic element of nature, introducing it into two channels: the channel of artistic attitude towards crafts and the channel of craft attitude towards arts. And in manifestations of cruelty, a sadistic hue sometimes became clearly distinguishable.

From these qualities arose the mistakes of state thinking that led Peter to actions that were, from the perspective of meta-history, and perhaps also history, erroneous and harmful: to unjustified cruelty towards the boyars, musketeers, schismatics, his own son, and above all, his own people, who sacrificed not just enormous but sometimes unnecessary sacrifices to their king's designs; to a blind lack of understanding of the urgent historical need to ensure the growth, and later leading role, of the middle class, an error that had truly fatal consequences for the future; to violence against the church, which after Peter, according to later thinkers, was left paralyzed and in the third reign reached such a level of groveling before its own enemy that in any other era it would seem completely improbable; to neglect of the interests of the peasantry, which led to the consolidation of serfdom and for centuries slowed down the cultural development of the main class of Russian society; and finally, to the establishment in the country of an atmosphere of terror, devaluation of human life, and disrespect for the individual, which long outlasted Peter and became an attribute of autocracy in a number of subsequent epochs.

No matter how grandiose the figure of this emperor was, and no matter how providentially necessary his activity appeared, the ambivalence of the impulses received by his raging heart, heroic will, and far-sighted but utilitarian mind turned the rodomysla into a dual creature before whom the gates of Sinclyta were closed.

It is difficult to find a more striking opposition between the images of two dynasties that caused serious damage to their mission: those who, having been elevated to the pinnacle of autocracy, irretrievably fell from this height - Ivan IV and Peter, who continued to perceive the inspiration of Yaroslav until the end of their lives. It is difficult to find a more striking contrast between them than that revealed when comparing the circumstances of the deaths of their sons, Ivan and Alexei. In one case - a suicidal act for the dynasty and the state, committed by a creature that had lost its human form and was seized by senseless madness: a vivid manifestation of the will of Velgi. In the other - a coldly calculated and ruthless measure carried out in the name of the state idea, for which its own flesh and blood are sacrificed: an equally obvious involvement of the demon of statism.

Perhaps no less curious is to imagine both tsars not dealing with state affairs, not striking Tatars or Swedes, but feasting. One - surreptitiously looking at the feasters and immediately doing something outrageous, one could even say monstrous: once - striking an infamous boyar with a staff in the chest, another time - biting off someone's ear among the guests, the third time - laughing uncontrollably at a prince dressed in a bear skin and being torn apart by dogs, the fourth time - forcing some unfortunate person to eat genitals of his own father.

And after a century and a half, there was a great ruler: a giant with a murky gaze, but firmly standing on wide-spread legs, making a former boyar or perhaps a baker or shoemaker, now a nobleman, laugh and pat him on the back, and then drink a cup of the Great Eagle with a gulp.

A truly great person cannot but be magnanimous. Ivan the Terrible was huge, but devoid of magnanimity, and thus he was not great. Peter, on the other hand, was magnanimous, with an unusual, magnificent magnanimity. Pushkin wonderfully captured this:

    He reconciles with his subject,
    Releasing the guilty of their fault,
    Drinking a cup of ale with him alone.

But the most expressive parallel, it seems to me, is the comparison of the circumstances of the deaths of both tsars. In the first case, it was rotting alive, tossing in grief and prayers, desperate attempts to soften God by orders of pardoning criminals and opening all the prisons. In the other case, it was an unreserved dedication to the impulse of saving the drowning sailors and his own death as a consequence of this heroic act.

Clearly, of course, Peter's posthumous fate could not have anything in common with the posthumous fate of his distant predecessor.

But in the synclite, one cannot enter who has turned themselves into an executioner - both in a figurative and literal sense; those who have crossed over heaps of sacrifices - their own subjects, who are innocent of any wrongdoing and gave up their souls to God only because the leader required it at that moment, without any concern for the lives of thousands of builders to raise a new capital - the key to Russia's global future.

To this capital, the shelt, astral, and demonized ether of the founder of the Petersburg Empire are attached. Falconet's Bronze Horseman is not just a statue. It is something like the icon of the Second Zhrugra, personified in the conditional guise of the brightest of his human inventions. It is also a likeness of the founder of Drukkarg, rushing on a frenzied rarugga. Moreover, this is a representation of the founder of Duggur, adjusted according to human consciousness and Enrof's conditions, sitting in the lunar twilight on a giant serpent and illuminating the lush and gloomy square with a torch in an outstretched hand.

On the Senate Square, concepts are turned upside down: Peter rushes on a horse, trampling on a snake; around him are the bright colonnades of the empire. However, like any icon that combines the emanations of the depicted with the emotional contemplation and reverence of the human masses, this monument is connected by thousands of threads to the one whose ashes have rested for two hundred years in the underground of the Petersburg Fortress.

The shelt of the emperor, now clothed in a demonized material cover, is bound by the heavy chain of his deeds to the underside of his own metaproimage. Like a moving caryatid in the citadel of Drukkarg, this giant still supports what he has created: the Russian world power. And is he alone? Zhrugrs may change, forms of national organization may fall and be rebuilt, but the great reformer will remain one of those who support the Russian state with their power as long as it exists on Earth. And then? Who and when will remove the burden from this Atlas? Only the liberation of Navna, only the destruction of Drukkarg, only the death of the last of the Zhrugrs, only the end of the Russian great power.

## Book IX. To the Metahistory of the Petersburg Empire

### Chapter 1. The Second Witzraor and Outer Space

When contemplating the meta-history of Russia in recent centuries, a striking comparison naturally arises between two historical moments.

The Romanov dynasty, chosen by the All-Russian Council, blessed by the Church, welcomed by all the estates of the country, and sanctioned by the authority of the great lineagers of the Time of Troubles, embarked on the grateful and arduous task of restoring and aggrandizing Russia. The Tsar was a sixteen-year-old boy, devoid of any talents or exceptional qualities, and this was later forgiven him. No one expected him to be a genius. Society had a strong and unshakable confidence that this monarchy, which had been wrought by the people in the terrible crucible of turmoil, foreign invasions, and powerlessness, was protected and directed from above. And indeed, the fatal impossibility of creating other, brighter forces to shield the people from destructive pressures from outside and from deadly conflicts within, prevailed over the demiurge. This led to the fact that the second Witzraor of Russia, together with his instruments of power - the bearers of state power - was overshadowed by a providential sanction as the lesser of two evils.

Three hundred years have passed. The monarchy of the Romanovs, hated by all classes, despised by all creative minds of the nation, condemned by the highest representatives of the people, and captivated by the mystical nonsense of a crook who dreamed of a patriarchal hat, collapsed almost without resistance. The last autocrat was as colorless and unenlightened as its founder; but nothing was forgiven to him. He was accused of an innate lack of genius, because only a state genius could have saved the old empire, giving it progressive movement, injecting new forces, and pointing out a new goal. Society was firmly convinced that the Romanov monarchy failed to cope with historical tasks, was not directed by any forces from above, and had no right to life. And indeed, there were no reflections of a demiurge above the heads of the emperors for a long time. Stubborn fools or tragic failures, they could not bring grace to their activities. And everyone understood that the solemn ceremony of coronation had turned into a miserable masquerade, into fiction. If the catastrophe had not interrupted the natural course of events, it could be expected that Grigory Rasputin would achieve the restoration of the patriarchate, that the hat of St. Hermogenes would be placed on the head of the Khlystovskiy "savaof", a debaucher and former horse thief, and that several years later, Emperor Alexei II would be crowned in the Assumption Cathedral by this madman, this puppet of Gashsharvy. Only the catastrophe saved the church from such an indelible shame.

Obviously, the sanction from the second witzraor was lifted long ago. But why? And when exactly? It is evident that the activity of Peter was saturated with the involvement of the demiurge, although not only with it. Therefore, the loss of sanction occurred in one of the subsequent epochs. But when exactly? Under whom? What were the faults of the witzraor that led to this loss? And do we not see at this turning point in history some exceptional figure whose destiny is still full of incomprehensible meaning?

The historicism of all schools agrees that among those who stood at the helm of power during these three hundred years, the most significant figure was Peter, and that no one else's importance or scale of personality can be compared to his. This thesis requires revision. It requires it because it takes into account not all the facts and processes, and because it completely ignores the spiritual side of the historical process as a whole, that is, metahistory.

Let us check whether a personality no less significant than Peter has emerged in the historical layer after him, but in terms of the nature of its significance, it could be called the antipode of the great founder of the empire. Let us also find out whether the fate of this person is related precisely to the circumstances and the period when the demiurge's sanction was lifted from the activity of the second witzraor. And finally, let us delve into the true meaning of this strange, ambivalent, surrounded by legends, mysterious image, not only for its contemporaries but also for us, distant descendants.

However, before tackling this task directly, it is impossible to avoid considering a whole chain of other problems, without a meta-historical understanding of which the role of the person in question cannot be understood. These problems boil down to the final assessment of the activity of the second uicraor based on a comparison of what tasks the demiurge set for him in Russia and what was actually achieved by the second demon of the great power.

The zenith of his creative power was undoubtedly the era of Peter. Compared to the historical perspectives that opened up to Russia at that time, the old concept of the Third Rome began to seem like groundless dreams, an empty abstraction. But what exactly should be understood by this new perspective? That is, how exactly could it be envisioned by those who lived on the cusp of the 18th century?

Obviously, it was a vague but powerful sense of global spaces; it resembled the breath of the ocean, the penetrating, salty and noisy wind that suddenly burst into a closed world that had existed for so many centuries. The center of statehood was transferred to the shore of the maritime space. Statehood began to be created by a new continent of people; and for them, this atmosphere, which did not know solid geographical boundaries, was northernly cold and maritimely demanding, seemed incomparably higher compared to the atmosphere of Moscow Rus, which was saturated with local smells, stuffy, earthy, and viscous.

The historical significance of this feeling, it seems to me, is that Peter's contemporaries and their descendants began to perceive humanity and their place in it in a new way.

The Tatar igo and the centuries-long struggle for creating a national state only pitted Russians against peoples whose cultural level did not exceed theirs, and mostly on the battlefields. As a result, a huge national egocentrism developed, manifesting in a range of colors from religious-mystical pride to vulgar bourgeois arrogance. After the victory over the Poles in 1612, the Russian people grew in their own eyes into a giant, the only people of God on earth. It was not far from the boiling point that produces such turbulent vapors that eventually explode the vessel of national-state existence, as it once happened with the Jewish people. When you read the works of Protopope Avvakum or become familiar with the eschatological hopes of other schismatics, this Orthodox-Russian messianism strikes our fortunately already immune mind with such force that you recoil from these writings with a feeling similar to that sensation that makes us pull our hand away from under a hundred-degree steam jet. It is possible and necessary to pay tribute to the personal heroism of the schismatics. It is quite natural to share the feeling of the trans-physical anxiety that gave rise to the schism in their own way. But thank God that this movement did not become dominant in Russia. A people who believed themselves to be the Messiah and all the rest of humanity to be wandering in darkness condemns itself to one of two things: either to the tragedy of the destruction of its historical citadel (let us remember again Judaism), or to the sterile boiling and evaporation within itself, within those same boundaries that it considered a shield against great cultural and ethical temptations (let us remember Byzantium). It has long been realized and expressed that any people bringing a new word into the world, as Dostoevsky said, feels its chosenness. But this chosenness is not unique, and any self-aggrandizement on this score threatens catastrophe.

The Peter the Great era dramatically changed the Russians' perception of humanity; now it began to consist not of two, but of three great entities.

Firstly, the great Western culture (which at that time did not yet notice that there were two cultures in the West: Roman Catholic and North-Western, mostly Germanic, closely linked with Protestantism). This unified, seemingly magical Western culture was deep, mature, multifaceted, and remarkably democratic and hardworking, while remaining aristocratically contemptuous. Much had to be learned from it.

Secondly, there was an indefinite blur of "wild" and "pagan" peoples, including Buddhist, Hindu, and even Muslim peoples, considered to have nothing to teach, and in relation to them, one could adopt an aristocratic view from above.

And finally, Russia's own super-people, who were not messiahs, but in terms of their size and territory, and the feeling of hidden power within them, were clearly destined for something great and urgently needed to catch up on what had been missed.

However, if we try to uncover any ideological depth under this layer of new perceptions, we will soon find ourselves in sad bewilderment. What content was invested in the concept of Russia's "great future"? What cultural or social meaning did it acquire?

In the 18th century, we will not find a more meaningful answer than Lomonosov's formula, proclaiming that "Russian land will give birth to its own Platos and quick-witted Newtons." That is, the Russian people would not be inferior to others, producing exceptional individuals endowed with genius. And that's it.

But Lomonosov, perhaps our first genius (herald) since the time of Andrei Rublev, could not, obviously, be unaffected to some degree by Yaroslavl and Novgorod. When we move from poetic formulas, albeit extremely simplified, but still reflecting the influence of this inspiration, to those layers of national consciousness that were possessed by the demon of great-power statehood, we are even more struck by the emptiness of the idea of "Russian greatness".

No matter how much we search for the content of this idea in the statements of people from the 18th century, from Menshikov to Potemkin and Suvorov, we will not find anything other than the idea of military, great-power, purely external power. This ideal was proclaimed either in the dry imperative language of orders and laws, or in the pompous lexicon of manifestos, or in the cries of the military command, or finally, in the solemn clanging of political lyres. The theory of the Third Rome was illuminated by a vague, but still reflected the ideal of religious and ethical values. Now even this distant radiance has faded, and the familiar words about the "Orthodox" tsar have degenerated into a dead rhetorical figure. And it was difficult, indeed, to attach great importance to the Orthodoxy of those, the greatest of whom amused themselves and their capital with the spectacle of the "All-Sober Council", that is, with hooligan antics in the style of those anti-religious processions and carnivals that were so sadly famous for the voluntary society of "Atheists" in the 1920s. But the leaders of this society did not proclaim themselves, at least, Orthodox. On the contrary, with all frankness and sharpness, they declared their anti-religious intolerance. What can be said about the "Orthodoxy" of their distant predecessor? Of course, Peter was a complex, contradictory, and ambivalent personality. Today - mocking the church, tomorrow - sincere prayer. But many of those who had watched his sacrilegious amusements the day before could hardly have believed in the sincerity of his prayers.

Thus, the ideological poverty of the second demon of statehood was already determined very soon; its desire for external power as the only positive goal was exposed.

The chain of victorious military campaigns and the galaxy of brilliant heroes of the empire reflected in the historical layer of the 18th century this meta-historical aspiration of the second witzraor. Were these campaigns necessary from the teleology perspective of the demiurge Yarosvet?

If the second witzraor had already fully emerged from demiurgic leadership, like his predecessor did under Ivan the Terrible, Yarosvet's sanction would have been lifted already in the 18th century. However, an event like the Patriotic War of 1812 with its stunning, awakening impact on the people indicates that even in this late era, the demiurge and demon of statehood were still able to act, so to speak, together. Therefore, as empty as the wars of Anna, Elizabeth, and Catherine may seem to our eyes, some of them pursued a goal that was unclear to the performers themselves but had a meta-historical justification. Thanks to them, by the 19th century, the state acquired the geographical contours that largely coincided with the borders of the super-nation. This eliminated the danger, which had so menacingly manifested in the history of most other cultures, of fragmentation into several stable state units that had torn apart the body and soul of their super-nation for centuries with bloodshed and spiritual rivalry.

However, despite everything, the second Romanov did not acquire a truly global perspective until the very end. Perhaps this was natural for a demon from a strictly continental nation; in any case, Peter never conveyed the oceanic scope of his dreams to his successors, neither to his close nor distant ones. Later, only in the consciousness of Alexander I, did the dream of his great-grandfather seem to flicker, as he sent expedition after expedition on circumnavigation voyages.

The other holders of state power from Birone to Nicholas II repeated the historical narrow-mindedness of the one who, with an enchanted gaze, stared at the dark-ether giants of Western Europe, taking them into account and seeing the meaning of their desired triumph only in this zone.

Intellectual poverty forced them to cling to the traditions of the historical past, trying to compensate for their own creative sterility in this way. Such is the stubborn attachment of Russian statehood to the idea of its continuity from the Byzantine Empire - a pitiful relic of the religious concept of the Third Rome. The images of the double-headed eagle on the citadel of Istanbul and the cross on the Hagia Sophia attracted its gaze with hypnotic force from century to century. States arose and collapsed around them, the world was shaken by great revolutions, newly discovered continents appeared on the horizon, and ideological systems arose that threatened to leave no stone unturned from old mythological ideas. The executioners approached, preceded by prophecies and social storms, not only of the monarchy but also of Orthodoxy... And the persistent idea of sargrad and the "straits" hovered before the eyes of the last Tsar with the same immobility as before the eyes of Potemkin. The same innate inability to think on a global scale and keep pace with the widening of historical arenas remained.

The issue of access to the seas deserved to be one of the secondary problems of Russian statehood, no more. Because access to the Mediterranean, which is as enclosed as the Black Sea, promised Russia nothing but private trade benefits and new conflicts with new neighbors. Only to a hopelessly provincial mindset could it seem like an exit to somewhere. It flagrantly did not correspond to the scope or prospects of the 19th and even less so the 20th century. If it was necessary to achieve access to an open sea, how could one not see that the waves of the Indian Ocean were rolling up to the coast right along the Tiflis meridian, separated from Russia only by still-aggressive Persia? What Peter could not have accomplished when the southern steppes and Georgia had not yet been annexed, the rulers at the turn of the 19th century could and should have accomplished. But they all treated this task with astonishing indifference. It was enough to encounter the diplomatic machinations of England for the Russian movement in Iran to be halted forever. Only Griboedov's death, like a mournful monument, blackens this road, along which Russian statehood was able to take only one step, and even then only to pull its foot back immediately.

The second demon of statehood was no more capable of considering anything serious in the possessions of Siberia and the Pacific. In the end, this amorphous, shortsighted policy was fittingly crowned with Tsushima and Mukden.

However, the question is often asked: did Russia really need these empty spaces? Was the territory not too vast? Was it worth such sacrifices?

Indeed, it cost a lot of lives and still does, but the exploration and conquest of the almost empty Siberian, Far Eastern, and American territories were carried out, as I have already pointed out, not by the state, but by the people themselves. Complaining about such a process is as strange as complaining, for example, about a liquid that, when spilled on a flat surface, will spread over it according to the laws of nature until the energy of spreading outweighs the force of particle cohesion. But just as the spread of the super-people across the vast empty lands was in accordance with natural laws, so many of the empire's conquest-oriented aspirations were at odds with these laws and in line with falsely understood state interests. This applies entirely to the idea of straits, the bloody Balkan Wars, and the conquest of Central Asian countries, which Russia did not need at all and no one would have thought of annexing, probably, if not for the cowardice of state actors, in whose eyes the danger of England's occupation of Central Asia — a completely unreal danger — finally grew to the size of an uncontrollable nightmare. In other words, the blows were directed not where the emperor would have directed them if the sense and pathos of the world space were not alien to him. It was not possible to invert the demon of statism with this pathos. And the task, in the meantime, was precisely to fill all the hollow space between the existing cultures with Russia. By occupying Siberia and Alaska, the people suggested to their empire in which direction efforts should be made, but this voice was neither heard nor understood. Geography and history suggested to the emperors a way out to the Indian Ocean, but this, too, turned out to be a voice crying out in the wilderness.

However, someone might be surprised: does this mean that historical reflection can lead to justifying conquests? And even to regret that a certain enterprise did not happen? Is it possible to reconcile this with elementary moral norms that are clear as day and necessary as bread for us? This touches on the most fundamental theme, the basic principles of meta-historical ethics. Of course, both readers and the author would prefer the answer to be given in the form of concise aphorisms. But this exceeds my abilities. And without claiming the brevity of this chapter, I would rather dwell on it a little here than leave the reader in a state of confusion and even outrage.

A preliminary consideration that some historical phenomena, in themselves remaining evil because they bring suffering and death to many people, can at the same time, and even quite obviously, be lesser evils. War is a source of suffering for peoples and a lowering of their moral level, therefore - evil. But a greater evil is conceivable, for example - the evil of prolonged, universal, exhausting enslavement of a people. And if the historical choice is between these two manifestations of evil, then the choice of the lesser of them is justified. The struggle against the Tatars, the Polish invasion of 1612, and Napoleon - all these wars cost a colossal amount of suffering and victims, and yet no one doubts that these sacrifices were justified. From the point of view of meta-history, the most terrible catastrophe is the irreparable failure of the super-people to fulfill its meta-historical (and historical) mission. Any twist in the historical path, at the end of which such a danger looms, must be avoided at any cost. And when such a danger weighs on one of the scales, no amount of personal suffering can outweigh it.

Of course, this law is cruel. But the demiurges and not the Creator God are to blame for this. The biological and historical laws that now dominate in Shadanakar can only be morally understood by acknowledging their duality, by understanding the burden and distortion of the original principles of universal ascent caused by the intervention of demonic forces. But the enlightenment of the Law is the task of grand periods. It will not be accomplished in a moment by our whim. We live inside the Law, are subject to it, and are forced to take it as a fact. Moreover, the Law is far from the worst possible. The worst possible is its further distortion and aggravation, which is the dream of the Anti-god. That is why, in many cases, one should approach the Law as the lesser of two evils.

I do not want to leave this thesis without specific historical examples. How, for example, should we approach the fact of the colonial expansion of European nations from the 16th to the 19th century? From the perspective of "absolute humanism," it was a continuous chain of violence by the strong over the weak, and often even worse over the better. Through this violence, the upper layers of Western European society were enriched, and peoples in other parts of the world were exhausted, or even disappeared from the historical scene. Not only from the perspective of any theories, but also from the perspective of our immediate living conscience, this is monstrous.

Alright. Well, from a metahistorical perspective?

Metahistory is called metahistory precisely because it is impossible to consider either individual human life or the existence of an entire people or humanity in isolation from spiritual pre-existence and afterlife. The path of cosmic development of any creature or group of creatures has already been traced through layers of immateriality, rows of worlds, up the ladder of different forms of existence, and after passing the form in which we currently reside, it may go - perhaps for immeasurable periods - into a new series of ascending and enlightening worlds. The period we experience in relation to the whole is comparable to a ten-second stop at a station in the night steppe of a passenger train crossing a giant continent. And until we learn to contemplate historical and cosmic panoramas in all their grandeur, until we get used to such proportions, scales, and regularities, our judgments will hardly differ from those of an insect or animal, capable of approaching life phenomena only from the perspective of its personal interests or the interests of a tiny community.

Our immediate conscience is outraged by the spectacle of suffering - and it is right in that. But it cannot take into account either the possibilities of even greater suffering that are prevented by this suffering or the entire immeasurable expanse and unfathomable complexity of spiritual destinies, both of monads and their combinations. In this lies its limitation. Equally correct and equally limited are all the humanistic norms born of the impulse of this conscience.

Meta-historical ethics is built on absolute trust. In some cases, meta-history may reveal the purpose behind and the compensation for seemingly meaningless historical sacrifices. In other cases, it exceeds the capacity of one's consciousness. In the third case, it becomes clear that these sacrifices and the historical circumstances that caused them are manifestations of the forces against God and are contrary to the Providence Principles, and therefore, unjustified. But in all of these cases, the meta-historian remains faithful to its only dogma: You are good, and your providence is good. The dark and cruel things are not from you.

Therefore, the answer to the question posed should be given without hesitation, no matter how many individual moral consciousnesses may be repelled by such a statement. Yes, the universal task of the two Western super-nations is to create a level of civilization at which the unification of the world becomes a real possibility, and the implementation of a certain set of moral and legal norms, not very high yet, but giving rise to an idea that is no longer emanating from Western demiurges and not guided by them: the idea of transforming states into fraternities parallel to the process of their unification, first into a global federation and subsequently into a monolithic humanity. Different national and cultural systems will not be mechanically united in it by the apparatus of state violence, but fused by spirituality and high ethics. This process will be led by an ever-increasing contingent of people who are educating the new generations with the ideal of a refined human being. However, this stage is already beyond the duty of Western cultures as such.

Developing in such a way as to establish and spread the necessary moral and legal norms required only one Northwestern culture. Colonial expansion occurred before these norms were developed; they were developed by Northwestern nations in parallel, synchronously with the enslavement and depletion of the colonized. It was only in the 20th century that these principles became clear and established enough in Northwestern societies to begin spreading outward, and then military expansion was replaced by the expansion of socio-legal ideas. We do not know how many more centuries the peoples of the East and South would have remained at the level of socio-legal primitivism if democratic, humanistic, and socio-economic concepts had not flooded into their consciousness from the Western civilization that enslaved them and is now liberating them. Liberating - contrary to its own colonialism, simply by the logic of things; liberating not only from its own oppression, but from feudal chaos, the yoke of ancient exhausted ideas and ossified forms of life, and from many other evils. And this is only the beginning of a truly global stage when humanity will reap the fruits sown in the fields of all countries of the earth by this ruthlessly bloody and highly humane civilization.

The topic under consideration seems so important to me that I risk detaining the reader's attention with one more example, more frequent but no less complex. The villainous destruction of the kingdom and culture of Peru by Spanish conquistadors is offensive and terrifying to us. There is no excuse for the crimes of the Spanish conquerors; the posthumous fate of each of them was, one would assume, terrible. But this is only one side of the catastrophe that occurred in South America in 1532. Understanding the other side is incomparably more difficult.

It is difficult to accept that the most amazing and unique Inca empire (for a historian, however, remaining only a curious local rarity) appears as a phenomenon of a completely different scale, an embryo of unrealized formation, grandiose and frightening, fraught with the disruption of countless human masses with treacherously hidden spiritual coolness for meta-historical contemplation.

By the time the Spaniards appeared, the Inca empire had already spread over almost a quarter of the South American continent, with its extraordinary spiritual, economic, and socio-political structure (some researchers call it theocratic socialism), which is characterized by high material well-being, purchased at the cost of extreme enslavement of personality, the price of losing the human self in an unquestionably obedient faceless mass. There is nothing more terrible than such a system brought to perfection, that is, transformed into a diabolical machine of mass spiritual killings; the dream of Gag-tung-ra, as far as it concerns humanity, lies precisely in this. Only the scales in this case are not national, but planetary, but one has to start somewhere... If the Inca state had found the strength to resist the Spaniards, to assimilate their technical and military advantages and to continue its independent development, as, for example, Japan did, then after some time humanity would have faced a tyranny so centralized, so perfect, so powerful and unshakable that the gaze is lost in the murky glare of global human catastrophes that did not occur precisely thanks to the Spaniards and only to them.

Do those who committed atrocities against Emperor Atahualpa and all the individuals who made up the Peruvian people justify these distant positive consequences? Do indirect, distant, and unforeseen positive consequences of one's actions justify a person who committed evil? - A strange thought. Of course not! Indirect, distant consequences, whether good or bad, which he could not foresee, do not serve as justification or condemnation for the person who committed them. He is justified or condemned only by the immediate consequences that were within his field of vision and, most importantly, by the motivations that guided him in this particular case. This is where personal karma lies.

What does a person who falls victim to a national disaster reap with their suffering and death? Partly, they reap the fruits of their personal karma. However, if they are not guilty of any wrongdoing, then they suffer and die not as an individual, but as a member of the national collective, and their suffering and death contribute to the untying of this karmic knot forever. This is collective karma, in this case, national-cultural-state karma. The sum of individuals who made up the Peruvian people in the second quarter of the 16th century, and who untied the terrible knot of national karma with their deaths, are freed for ascension into immaterial worlds and the creation of their enlightened metacultural sphere. This sphere is being created in a series of zatamys and is called Intil, and all those who were once part of the great ancient Peruvian people will ascend or have ascended to it, sooner or later.

Does the destruction of the Peruvian Empire, not as individual atrocities committed by the conquistadors, but as a cumulative fact, require some second ethical assessment, an assessment that will not remove from those who committed this evil the condemnation of our conscience or the merciless karmic consequences in the afterlife for each of them, even to the centuries-long torments in Ukharvayr or Propulka, but that will give this evil a relative justification? Yes, it does.

This assessment will demonstrate, in the context of the case at hand, the ethics of metahistory. It is like a second ethical layer, stretched over the layer of purely humanistic ethics familiar to our consciousness and conscience.

This extensive digression on some principles of metahistorical ethics was necessary to answer a question posed several pages earlier.

Yes, in some cases, a meta-historical contemplation can lead to a relative justification (only in terms of universal development of humanity, not in terms of individual karmic responsibility) of conquests. And even to involuntary regret that a certain enterprise did not occur. It is possible to reconcile this with elementary moral norms that are "as clear as day and as necessary as bread", and I have shown how to do it by clarifying the issue of the relationship of the Second witzraor to the world space.

So why is it still a mistake in the meta-historical sense to lose such a deserted, distant, and difficult-to-preserve territory as Russian America? And why is such importance attached to the unrealized access to the Indian Ocean here?

But it has already been mentioned twice about the epochal task set before the Russian statehood: filling the space between all existing cultures. Filling means the closest contact with all of them, mutual exchange of spiritual radiations and, therefore, not only external rapprochement but also mutual spiritual enrichment.

Persistent, not stopping at any cost, the accelerated exploration of Russian America could not help but lead to the emergence of the closest and immensely important cultural links between Russia and the rising, highly talented young culture of the United States. It is quite possible that Russian America, enriched by the discovery of gold in its depths and benefiting from the advantages of its remoteness from the metropolis, would have separated and formed a kind of second Russia, much smaller but advanced, enterprising, and, most importantly, democratic. The reverse cultural and ideological impact of Russian America on the autocratic metropolis would have activated the forces of the liberation movement in the empire, given it a completely different hue, and by the mid-20th century, instead of languishing under the tyrannical rule of the third Zhugra, Russians would have already achieved a more harmonious structure and a more moral, soft, and just way of life.

Access to the Indian Ocean, in contact with Arab-Muslim culture, not on its outskirts as happened with Central Asia and Azerbaijan, but in close proximity to the authentic centers of this culture, and, what is even more important, in immediate proximity to the inexhaustible spiritual wealth of the highly developed Indian and Indomalayan cultures - all this would inevitably lead to the establishment of first trade, and then close cultural ties with all the countries of the Indian Ocean basin. A close acquaintance with the accumulated and creative treasures of these cultures, with all the diversity and vividness of their psychological, social, religious, artistic manifestations, with the historical and spiritual experience that each of them preserves in its literature and daily life, philosophy and religion, art and morality - all this would so broaden the horizons of the thinking layers of the Russian super-people that there would be no trace left of its continental, semi-European provincialism. We had a two hundred year cultural pilgrimage to the West. It was necessary, inevitable, deeply thought out and justified. But the exclusivity of this orientation of the Russian gaze towards Western Europe deprived Russians of the opportunity to compare the images and values of different equivalent cultures; the flatness and utilitarianism of the latest European civilization were perceived by broad layers as a kind of life philosophy, as a world view, and the depressing consequences of this are still far from being overcome. A cultural pilgrimage to the East, to the thousand-year centers of spirituality, would have weakened the influence of this Klingsor side of the Western spirit, would have balanced it with the idealism and necessary contemplativeness, without which national energy is directed only towards the achievement of material goods, and the mind - towards the comprehension of only rationally obvious truths. Russians know how to assimilate well. And in the assimilated forms, they pour new content; in the end, completely original creations of culture and civilization emerge. There are many examples. Let us recall at least Russian literature, of which we rightly proud, one of the deepest literatures: after all, the genres in which it lived and lives were borrowed from the West. Not only that, it was precisely after their assimilation that great Russian literature was born. If what I am talking about had happened, Russian literature would have been enriched with new themes, genres, techniques, and plots, which would have been adequate to the ideas and images of those masterpieces that remained unrealized in reality. Russian visual art would have been enriched with new ways of seeing the world, it would not have been stuck for a whole century on the realistic primitivism of the peredvizhniki, and it would have shone with such colors, compositions, emotions, and plots that are now impossible to imagine. Russian architecture, which had long been exhausted after borrowing from the West but embodying classicism in its own way, would have received such an influx of ideas from the inexhaustible treasures of Eastern architecture that the second half of the 19th and probably the entire 20th century would have to be considered not as a period of its deep decline, but as its golden age. - Russia (it's time to admit) did not create philosophy. The type of philosophy developed by antiquity and the West turned out to be inadequate to the profound needs of Russian generalizing thought and almost did not fertilize it. Would this have been the case if a hundred years ago, before the broad layers of intellectuals, the philosophemes and mythologemes of the East had stood in full height? - The conservative provincialism of Russian Orthodoxy was neither shaken nor refreshed by the invasion of Europeanism. But would it have remained so amorphous and oblique if a stream of ideas had poured in from the East and South, developed by millennia of spiritual life in this cradle of all religions, in Asia?

Mainly: The Russian super-people will sooner or later have to take the lead in creating inter-religion and inter-culture. Perhaps in the future, the leading roles in this process will be taken over by other nations, but the task of laying the foundations will apparently fall on their shoulders. This people, more than any other, needs not only knowledge but also spiritual understanding of the psychology of others, the ability to synthetically embody and love other mental structures, cultural forms, life ideals, and other racial and national expressions of the spirit. What could promote this more than mutual penetration, friendly, and, of course, not individual but wide layers, with the historical realities of other cultures? What else could protect us so well from imposing on other peoples precisely our own and only our own socio-political system, which currently dominates in the world view?... In our history, there should have been a cultural pilgrimage to the East and South, but to our great sorrow and that of the whole world, it did not happen.

As long as we do not free ourselves from our national-cultural arrogance, as long as we continue to feel as if Russia really is the best country in the world, then from our huge mass, nothing will come of it except for despotic threats to humanity.

Perhaps some of those reading my arguments have not been convinced, and they remain puzzled as to how it is possible to regret that Russian expansion did not head towards Iran a hundred and fifty years ago. Do my arguments not come down to listing the benefits that Russia would have gained from this expansion, with no consideration for Iran's interests?

No. My arguments boil down to something completely different. They are related to listing the advantages that the Russian super-people would gain in the event of this expansion. The Russian people are not an end in themselves, but rather carriers of a very specific global mission. The peoples of Russia have existed for one and a half centuries without annexing Iran, without perishing or degenerating. If my line of thinking were guided by national egoism, it would be expressed anywhere but on the pages of "Rose of the World". The changes in Russian culture, history, psychology, character, and worldview that would be caused by this expansion would also be reflected in what Russia spreads across the world in the mid-to-late 20th century. What it would spread would be different: broader, freer, more humane, more tolerant, affectionate, and kinder, more spiritual. And all the peoples of the world are interested in this, including the Iranian people, no less than any other. The historical losses that this people would have suffered in the event of Russian conquest of Iran one and a half centuries ago would hardly have made them any more unhappy than they were under the rule of their shahs for one and a half centuries, and certainly no more unhappy than Central Asia was after its annexation to Russia. But then they'll say that we didn't get access to the Indian Ocean. So what's the point of such a rant about what was missed?

And then, firstly, we are discussing the question of the second witzraor of Russia, his attitude towards the world space, and what he was right and wrong about. And secondly, as it is well known, we learn precisely from the mistakes and omissions of the past. Having finally realized what we missed, distorted, and burdened our historical path with, and how we complicated the implementation of the mission of the super-people, we can try to make up for the lost ground in new conditions, in a different era. By this, of course, I mean not any attempts to regain Russian America or capture Iran: both Russia and the whole world are already going through a completely different stage, and it is clear to everyone that in modern conditions such plans would be just a ridiculous and harmful anachronism, like a madman who danced at a funeral just because he missed the opportunity to do it at a wedding. I mean something completely different: cultivating in ourselves, in our nation, in its widest circles, such an attitude towards other cultures, other psychologies, ways of life, worldviews, friendly and sensitive relationships full of understanding, interest, tolerance, and love; an attitude whose essence is the aspiration to enrich oneself spiritually while enriching everyone else spiritually as well.

So, the second witzraor, who was sometimes almost suffocating from his dream of physical, that is, military power, not only failed to rise to the level of the global tasks of the super-people (no witzraor can rise to this level due to their demonic nature), not only did he fail to satisfy the idea of external power with any content, but he did not meet the level of those epochal tasks that were set before the statehood of the empire. He remained deeply provincial. For any nationalism, if one understands by this word the preference of one's nation over all others and the pursuit of its interests at the expense of other nations, is nothing else but provincialism, elevated to a principle and professed as a worldview.

The second Witzraor proved his incompetence in relation to the external space. But how did he perform his task in relation to the internal space?

### Chapter 2. The Second Witzraor and the Inner Space

Attempting to project onto the plane of human concepts the demands of the demiurge that were placed before the demon of statehood during Peter's reign, I emphasized in the previous chapters the urgent need for internal transformations in Russia, namely: the abolition of the boyars as the leading force (which was accomplished), the transfer of the leading role to the nobility (which was also accomplished), and the middle class (which was not accomplished) in order to gradually elevate and involve the poor, savage peasantry in civil and cultural life. This was also not accomplished.

The historical fact that Peter did not accomplish this was only half of the problem: the deadlines had not yet been missed. The real tragedy was that his successors were unable or unwilling to do this for one and a half centuries.

If one understands correctly the remarks about inter-religion, inter-culture, and transforming the state into a brotherhood that I have already made in previous chapters, then a bitter conclusion cannot be avoided: the spectacle of a super-people brought out of non-existence for such purposes and still, after a thousand years, 80% of its mass remains in a state of slavery - such a spectacle is alarming and deeply saddening.

The sadness is not so much about the fact of serfdom itself: at a certain stage, it was an evil that was hardly avoidable, caused by a number of well-known objective reasons that do not need to be outlined here. The sadness is in the irreparable delay of emancipation.

We are horrified by the gaping chasm between the super-people's sense of duty and the ethical quality of their social structure, which they allowed for centuries. The disconnect between the real ethical level of the super-people and the level required to fulfill their mission is frightening. Moreover, the delay in their liberation had several immediate and direct consequences that resonated with the realities of our post-revolutionary era.

Which of these consequences are most important from the perspective of meta-history?

The first consequence is economic and cultural. This is the primitive level of material well-being and the corresponding level of life demands. It goes without saying that this is a complete and absolute evil that did not elevate but rather degraded the individual. It is clear that without this factor, the formation of the third "ui-tsraor" - the monster of the 20th century - would not have had the opportunity to develop its methodology, which was only conceivable in a society accustomed to all kinds of deprivation, poverty, and destitution.

The second consequence is moral and psychological. This is the stable, deeply ingrained habit of slave mentality among the masses: the absence of civic feelings and ideas, humiliating submission, disrespect for the individual, and, finally, the tendency to become a despot if chance elevated the slave above his usual position. How tragically poignant is the admission made by one of the luminaries of our literature, Chekhov, on the threshold of the 20th century, that even he - yes, he! - had to squeeze the slave out of himself drop by drop for years, his whole life.

Without this difficult and long-lasting psychological trait, the emergence and magnificent flourishing of the third "ui-tsraor" would have been impossible as well.

The third consequence is religious in a broad sense. From slave psychology, from poverty of demands and aspirations, from narrow-mindedness, from poverty stems the paralysis of the spiritual-creative impulse. One cannot sit by the flickering light with a bloated stomach from hunger, a mind not enriched by any book, and a horde of hungry and naked children and create "spiritual values". The people, in the form of their greatest representatives who have proven their spiritual giftedness, depth, and scope of religious possibilities, have not produced any more meaningful spiritual movements in their mass for many centuries than Old Believers. An overview of Russian sects leaves an indelibly oppressive impression, especially on those who are even superficially familiar with the history of religious thought in antiquity, Byzantium, India, and Germany. Russian sectarianism is either the outbursts of the ancient orgiastic element, mixed with the unrecognizably turbid stream of Christianity and transformed into small swirls of mystical lust, or it is rationalistic sects of Western European origin, free from flagellant mutiny and skopetskiy insanity, but depressing in the pettiness of their commandments, amazing absence of aesthetic principles, silence of imagination, and some general lack of grace. It is better not to delve into the intellectually-generalizing, with permission - theological, aspect of all these sects at all: this is a desert landscape, strewn only with small prickles of embittered and arrogant polemics. As for the dominant church, except for five or six outstanding ascetics, in the bosom of this only truly spiritual reservoir of the great country, not a single wave has stirred, not a single stream has sparkled in two centuries. Only silent underwater currents - pilgrimage, wandering, cell prayer, and mystical inclusion of the masses in the transmutation of Christianity through worship and sacraments - testified that the Church had not died.

This was the third consequence of centuries of mass slavery and imperial church policy. It is hardly necessary to point out that even without this consequence, the emergence of the mass third estate in the suicidal form in which it was formed in history would have been impossible. The subsequent spread of primitive materialism throughout the vast expanse of the working class and semi-intellectual strata would have been impossible as well. The religious ignorance of the new Soviet generations, comparable only to the primitive nihilism of the famous Kubu tribe in science, would have been unthinkable. In short, the stability of such a religious level, which would pose an almost superhuman task of difficulty before the enlighteners of the next era, the heralds of the Rose of the World, would have been impossible.

But there was another fault that lengthened the list of sins of the numbed demon of the great power. I already mentioned it in passing; it is the ignoring of the most urgent historical need - the transfer of the leading state-social role to the middle class.

To describe the government measures that have been slowing down the development of merchants and the bourgeoisie for a century and a half, keeping the lower clergy in a state of stagnation, and pointing out the inactivity of the state up to the era of Alexander II in creating an interclass intelligentsia is to repeat what is known to everyone. But it may not hurt to express a thought that is shared by many, although not yet formulated, as far as I know, in our literature: if the state, without breaking with the nobility, had been able to rely on the merchants and bourgeoisie as early as the 18th century, if the formation of the national bourgeoisie and the mixed intelligentsia had taken place several decades earlier than it actually did, Russian history would have taken a different path, most likely an evolutionary one in the narrow sense of the word. It is impossible even to imagine how many disasters and tragedies this would have saved both our homeland and all of humanity.

However, reflecting on the second demon of great power's sins that ultimately led to the lifting of the demiurge's sanctions and his demise, we cannot help but ask ourselves: perhaps it is not so much he who bears these sins, but the unsuccessful conduits of his will who have successively led the Russian state in recent centuries?

From ancient times up to the 20th century, Russia remained a hereditary monarchy. Therefore, the dynasty itself became the main conduit of the will of the witzraor. However, the dynasty was not made up of phantom automatons or ideal agents perfectly suited to the witzraor's needs, but of living people with different innate characteristics. A peculiar scale of different degrees of involuntariness was created. Some of the monarchs became conduits of demonic will to a certain extent only by virtue of their position and, so to speak, the logic of power; the absence of special abilities made them tolerable to the witzraor at best. Others were completely unsuitable for his purposes: sluggish mental movements, extreme imbalance of character, or infancy in the absence of a suitable regent made them incapable of carrying out any purposeful chain of actions. Such individuals had to be eliminated by force (Ioann VI and Anna Leopoldovna, Peter III, Paul). Thus, the clash between the witzraor's will and the living diversity of human characters was one of the tragic internal contradictions of the system of government that the witzraor preserved and strengthened and that could only be led by a hereditary monarch. The principle of hereditary absolutism turned out to be an extremely imperfect, unreliable instrument that distorted the realization of the meta-historical plan of the witzraor with constant interference from chance occurrences.

But the position of the demon of power was further complicated by the fact that, by eliminating some contenders for power and elevating others, who also belonged to the same kind, he created something that went beyond his understanding, as did everything related to the field of ethics, because demons are amoral by nature. I mean the network of human karma, the web of guilt and retribution, the moral law of crime and punishment. According to this law, which is rarely overcome and only through the intervention of powerful Providential principles, guilt that is not redeemed during life is multiplied, burdening not only the perpetrator after death but also the fate of his descendants.

One can imagine the emergence of a fundamental psycho-historical study, based on the painstaking study of a vast biographical material about the lives of the representatives of the Romanov dynasty - a study that would reveal the inexorable implementation of the law of karma from Patriarch Philaret to the last emperor and his children. It would have to touch not only on the external course of events, but also on the depth of the soul, the internal conflicts, penetrating the labyrinth of which can only be done by someone who combines the erudition and impartiality of a scholar with the imagination of an artist and the intuition of a thinker. I do not have this data, and my task is only to indicate the possibility of such a topic and to make some brief comments on certain crucial moments of this centuries-old dynastic tragedy.

While killing his son Alexei, Peter I had little idea about the knot he was tying, as well as his invisible inspirer. The reins of power were in the hands of a consistent series of dynasty members, each of whom's right to the throne was in doubt. Of the thirteen monarchs who occupied the throne from Peter the Great to Nicholas II, four came to power through a coup, and six died a violent death. In the halls of the Winter Palace and Ropsha, in the Engineer's Castle, the Schlüsselburg casemates, and the basements of revolutionary Ekaterinburg, even on the winter Petersburg embankment illuminated by the sparse winter sun, the fatal hour of the autocrats caught up with them, and the growing tangle of guilt passed, enriching itself with new threads, into the fate of their successors.

Thus, the clash between the will of the autocrat and the incomprehensible law of human karma was the second contradiction of the social system he protected and strengthened. The chain of palace coups was only an expression of this meta-historical disorder in the question of the transfer of power. The faces who stood at the head of the state, successful or unsuccessful conductors of Zhruhr's will, each carried their own burden in death. However, the responsibility for the fact that for two hundred years the demon of statehood failed to create a more perfect historical instrument that could better perceive the envelopment and ensure the regular succession of human instruments at the head of state could and should only be borne by him.

But the main thing is not yet in this. If, considering the historical activity of the second witzraor, we even for a moment lose sight of his ultimate goal and dream - ideal tyranny - we will get confused in contradictions and eventually understand nothing in the material being analyzed. The goal of ideal tyranny loomed before the second witzraor at first as a distant dream, but since the time of Peter the Great, the following becomes noticeable: the demon of great power begins, as it were, to swing between attempts to fulfill the will of the demiurge - and its own tendency to turn statehood into a tyrannical apparatus. This can be traced in the activities of Anna, Catherine II, Paul, and finally Alexander I. At the end of the latter's reign, the readiness of the witzraor to fulfill demiurgic designs completely fades away, and Nicholas I, finally becoming a compliant tool of the witzraor, consumed by immeasurable pride, sets out on the same fatal path that Ivan the Terrible embarked on three hundred years before.

Thus, we come to an understanding of the reasons why the Second Zhrurom lost the sanction of Yarosvet and thus became historically doomed.

However, I would not like this examination of the activity of the second Vycraor to be perceived as belated criticism. This is not criticism, but an attempt to assess the historical activity of someone who headed the construction of the citadel of IGW at the bottom, in Drugkar, and the citadel of the Russian great power at the top, here. Only meta-history can approach the evaluation of historical phenomena by posing the question: what would have happened if in such-and-such a case, not this choice had been made, but another, not this force had won, but the opposite? Meta-historical reflection and a sense of scale will prevent asking questions regarding secondary phenomena, while the adopted methodology will prevent the dispersion into fantastic and implausible assumptions. Apparently, only on this, so far, path is it possible to switch from general teleology to a common understanding of history as a chain of signs into the interpretation of these signs, the decryption of reality, the interpretation of specific historical phenomena.

### Chapter 3. Lifting the Sanction

When Count Palen finally obtained from Tsarevich Alexander consent to remove Paul I from power, it was consent for his removal only. The question of the assassination of the semi-mad emperor did not arise. It was assumed that the suddenly arrested ruler would sign an act of abdication and be sent to Pavlovsk. But no one who knew the character of Paul Petrovich could be sure that royal blood would not be shed that night. The Tsarevich was given complete freedom to indulge in the hope of a successful outcome of the enterprise, and to push away the thought that the unhappy maniac, who considered himself always right in everything, would defend his royal dignity and his rights as long as he lived. Such a thought could not help but burn in Alexander's trembling soul. And when blood was actually shed, he considered himself guilty of patricide.

If his ascension to the throne had been lawful, as with any autocratic monarch, he would have taken on the burden of state karma: the same burden that follows behind the coffin after the unraveling of personal karma, the fate of a slave-builder in the citadel of the Uiсraor. But now Alexander had burdened his ethereal essence with silent, not formal, but internal consent to patricide. Such a crime leads to a postmortem fall into the depths of transphysical magma.

Of course, the fact that this act was essentially a measure of self-defense by Alexander and society as a whole against the actions of the government, instilled by the deteriorating psyche of Paul I, greatly mitigates the severity of this guilt. But Alexander's subjective conscience told him otherwise. Was it the fear of divine retribution? The predominant shade of his remorse was apparently something else: shame. Shame - and pity for the murdered. Shame, pity, and that incomparable, penetrating and burning sensation that constitutes the very essence of the pangs of conscience. This relentless feeling, which pursued him everywhere and always, and did not subside with the years, was one of the most important factors in the sum of reasons that led him to an unprecedented turning point in history - at the very end of his reign and beyond its chronological limits.

The second factor was the inherent mystical temperament of his nature. He was one of the carriers of such a character, such a mental makeup and such a concept of feeling, under which a person feels all his actions (and even more so, the greater the power is concentrated in his hands) as if in continuous connection with certain instances of Good and Evil, existing both outside him and within his soul in a spiritual struggle.

Of course, the fact that this act was essentially an act of self-defense by Alexander and society as a whole against the actions of the government, inspired by the deteriorating psyche of Paul I, greatly mitigates the severity of this guilt. But Alexander's subjective conscience told him otherwise. Was it the fear of divine retribution? The predominant shade of his remorse was apparently different: shame. Shame - and pity for the murdered. Shame, pity, and that incomparable, piercing feeling that constitutes the very essence of conscience pangs. This relentless feeling, which pursued him everywhere and always and did not subside with the years, was one of the most important components in that sum of reasons that led him to an unprecedented turning point in history - at the very end of his reign and beyond its chronological limit.

The tremors of a deep conscience (which some superficial observers mistook for weakness of character) and a sense of responsibility reached excruciating sharpness thanks to the desire to apply a religious and moral criterion to everything and a tendency to self-analysis. The will was strong enough to withstand the struggle with Napoleon if there was sympathy from the human multitude, but not strong enough for the steady implementation of broad plans if he was alone in these plans. And everything made him lonely, and increasingly so: the position of the autocrat, the originality of his character, the tendency towards ideas that did not find an echo in the era, the collisions of his personal life, and finally, the innate secrecy, exacerbated by a sense of perfect crime.

The third of the main components in Alexander's nature was that for which in circles close to the emperor and sensitive to what emanated from his personality, he was called "our angel" until 1812, and after the victory over Napoleon he was called "Blessed" and "the lineager of the nineteenth century".

Of course, one can exacerbate their innate myopia to the point of seeing only low and petty motives in all foreign phenomena of social-political and ideological life. Then, in these nicknames of Alexander, we will not see anything but manifestations of monarchic sycophancy. But what is important is that even sycophancy has assigned him precisely these names and no others. For some reason, not a single flatterer even tried to call him "wise," "valiant," or "great," but many people, not only courtiers but also in the noble, merchant, and even bourgeois strata, for some reason called him precisely "Blessed" and precisely "of the bloodline." Perhaps these nicknames were inaccurate, not philosophically and historically justified; they certainly did not reflect the output of meta-historical thought but something completely different: the living need of the people, inexperienced in philosophical and mystical subtleties, to express their understanding that the personality of this monarch has some special, highly moral, and "pleasing to God" significance. Obviously, something radiated from the personality of the tsar that sharply distinguished him from the regal, majestic, sometimes benevolent, sometimes terrifying and frightening, but never "angelic" radiation of his predecessors' personalities. Such radiation is only given by a deep spiritual life, a habit of sensing one's ethical duty, and weighing every step on moral scales.

These three components - a deep conscience, a mystical nature, and a sense of ethical duty as an autocrat and a human being - were manifestations of the deepest essence of Emperor Alexander, his best, his highest self.

Two factors opposed this: innate and acquired. Only 1/16 of Alexander's blood was Russian. It was the inheritance of Peter the Great, passed through the psycho-physical form of the poor Peter III and the mentally ill Paul. As if poisoned at these stages of the dynasty, it mixed with the dense, persistent, and uncompromising blood of the ruling families of Germany. Reverence for Prussian authority; a sense of everything German as irrational-kinship; love for military parades; an idea of the high, seemingly moral significance of militarism in general, combined with a petty and formal understanding of the qualities of a warrior; enthusiastic, almost ecstatic attitude towards marching and drill - all of this was transmitted in the dynasty with remarkable consistency from generation to generation, from Peter III to Alexander III. In Alexander I, this beginning was expressed weaker than in many others, but he was not free from it and could not be. It was stronger than him because it was inheritance.

And finally, the acquired factor: it played a significant role in Alexander's activities, and a purely negative one at that. This was the "logic of power" inherent in any autocracy. Even the mere presence on the throne sometimes forces the monarch to submit to the voice of the demon of statehood: contrary to morality, contrary to his own humanity, and contrary to high reason. Many of these manifestations, although not all, are inclined to be called justifying and even flattering terms by other politicians: "state common sense," "state realism." The demon of the great power is self-sufficient and absolutely egocentric. He is unable to compromise his immediate interests for any common ideas. This is precisely why, psychologically, cases occur when transformations initiated under the influence of high ideals freeze, do not reach the end or are distorted beyond recognition; when the state stubbornly refused even the slightest restriction of its sovereignty for the sake of uniting with others to pursue common, not private goals; when, digging its hooves into political tradition, the power resisted forces in its own country that sought the most urgent and historically justified reforms; when, finally, gripped by animal fear for its own existence, it dared to carry out mass repressions, thereby repelling those who had been its supporters until then. One must be a perfect lineager to never succumb to this voice while on the throne. However, Alexander, contrary to rumor, was not a lineager.

In his complex nature, the voice of "state common sense" intricately intertwined with an irrational fear of the Luciferian-revolutionary principle, with a deep psychic trauma caused by revolutionary storms in Europe. This voice argued with his better self all those years while his reformist activity lasted. This voice made him diminish and thin out transformation projects; the sound of this voice triumphantly intensified when it merged with the choir of reactionary circles involving Karamzin as a soloist, clamoring for the preservation of serfdom; this voice drowned out all others before the Patriotic War, when the ideologist and implementer of reforms, Speransky, was sent into exile. All this proves that Alexander did not become a true reformer, despite his undoubted opportunities.
But a great historical moment came when the confrontation between two wills in his country and in his soul - the will of the demiurge and the will of the autocratic great power - suddenly coincided, and the tearing consciousness of the king was illuminated by the brilliance of complete confidence in the rightness of his cause, in the help of God - Napoleon invaded Russia.

The providential nature of the outcome of the Patriotic War is so obvious that it requires no explanation. The thunder of the guns of Borodino and the glow of Moscow truly awakened the dormant consciousness and will of the thousand-year-old slave. As for the providential nature of the course of events that marked this war, it can be understood most likely from the enormous historical results that the war of 1812-14 could have had only by developing in precisely this way and not otherwise. The awakening of self-awareness and the activation of forces in all layers of the population would have been impossible without the powerful impetus provided by the Battle of Borodino, the enemy's occupation of the ancient, sacred heart of the country, and the fire that followed. The downfall of the Bonapartist empire would not have occurred if, as Kutuzov wished, the Russians had limited themselves to driving the enemy out of their homeland. The penetration of ideas and living impressions of a more mature culture into Russian society - the consequences of which were innumerable - would have been unthinkable without the transfer of the war to the fields of Western Europe and the long stay of the Russian army there. All of this is obvious. Much less obvious and less studied is another matter: the radical difference between the original idea of the Holy Alliance, which belonged personally to Alexander, and what the Holy Alliance degenerated into when Alexander, encountering no understanding either in Russia or in the West, withdrew, and European reaction, armed with the "state sense" and the amoral will of Metternich, used this institution in the interests of local security forces.

The reflection of high ethical duty always flickered in Alexander's conceptions of supreme power, its meaning and purpose. It was with these conceptions, which arose in his youth partly under the influence of La Harpe and by comparison with the unrestrained arbitrariness of Paul I, that he ascended the throne; based on them, he undertook the reforms that were later aborted; these conceptions hovered before his mind in 1812, 1813, and 1814; and it was they who cast the idea of the Holy Alliance in the light of the highest internal sanction.

The idea of the Holy Alliance, as it was presented to Alexander, apparently consisted of uniting all the leading nations of Europe into a harmonious whole inspired by religious and moral truth, under the guidance of those who were considered by the consciousness of that time to be the natural, legitimate rulers of the peoples. This leadership became an authority that exceeded the sovereignty of individual nations, and was supposed to ensure Europe's security from wars, revolutions, and dictatorships, internal peace, the development of spiritual forces, and the gradual moral improvement of the Christian world. ^^1

____________
^^1: The limitation of the Holy Alliance to the sphere of Christian nations was completely natural for the religious and political outlook of the early 19th century. It is as strange to reproach Alexander for the incomplete universality of his idea as it is, for example, to accuse Peter of not creating a domestic aviation industry.

Thus, the idea of the Holy Alliance was the first step in history towards the peaceful, top-down unification of humanity, at least the Christian part. We will not find any precedents for this, except perhaps in the cosmopolitan hierocracy of the Roman popes. However, it is necessary to show how much closer the idea and even the methods of the Holy Alliance were to the humanistic, civic enterprises of the 20th century than to the violent priestly autocracy of the Middle Ages. The further stage of this idea was nothing else but the expansion of the ideal scope of the desired alliance to the boundaries of all humanity and an attempt to concretely embody it in the League of Nations, then in the UN, and finally in the World Federation of the future. Metahistory cannot be surprised by all of this. If the anticipation, even humanly limited, of Yaroslav's goals as goals of transforming the world's social order into a brotherhood becomes his most precious hope, can it seem strange or psychologically unfounded to him that the first approximate reflection of this plan arose precisely in the consciousness of this monarch? Whose consciousness, if not that of Alexander, the deepest, most religious, and most ethically sensitive person among all those who occupied the Russian throne?

But if in any state, backed by witzraor, the state leader sincerely and seriously proclaims the ideals of ethical order, one of two things follows: either the forces of the demon of great power eliminate such a messenger as an annoying obstacle, or witzraor puts on the proclaimed ideal like a mask on its own face, gradually hollowing out the original intention of the messenger and turning that intention into its opposite.

It was all the more certain that this would happen with the idea that Alexander was a century ahead of his time. Bound by the witzraor principle of legitimacy, the emperor could not invent any higher supranational authority, except for the good will and living conscience of Christian rulers. And since these were not ideal people but the most ordinary kings, guided primarily by the notorious "state realism" and "common sense," it could be said from the outset that practice discredits the ideal, and nothing more.

Naturally, in this greatest, truly global design of his life, Alexander found himself even more lonely than in any other. After three or four years, the emperor finally realized that the leaders of European states were incapable of being imbued with such intentions; that this idea did not ignite a single heart or find a response in any soul in the intellectual sphere of Russia; that there were no statesmen on whom the emperor could rely - not a single one; and that the Holy Alliance, as he had envisioned it, was unfeasible. Worse yet: already created at his own initiative, it was steadily transforming into a purely political instrument of feudal reaction and, in particular and especially, into a tool of the narrow, self-interested policy of the Austrian court.

Napoleon's conqueror, the arbiter of great powers, and the master of Europe returned to St. Petersburg. He remained in the memory of high European society as a subtle diplomat and a gentleman to the tips of his nails.

He was an incorrigible lover of military parades, capable of spending hours and days inventing new designs for epaulets or braids for some guard regiment. He was a regal rider who, during a solemn entry into the capital, suddenly rushed with his sword drawn after a peasant who carelessly crossed his path. In Russia, he was known as Arakcheev's friend. 

Pushkin also knew him in this way. Gazing at the "bust of the conqueror," he decided that the portrait was truthful.

    In vain you see an error here:
    The hand of art has brought
    A smile upon these lips so clear,
    And wrath upon this cold, bright thought.

But the hand of art did not make a single movement with the chisel to make people understand that they were looking at the portrait of a dreamer who wanted to turn humanity into a Christian brotherhood; the portrait of a greedy seeker of mystical conversations with the elderly visionary, Madame Krudiner; the portrait of an untiring reader of the Holy Scriptures, the fathers of the church, and Western visionaries; the portrait of an unhappy man who spent hours on his knees in his lonely room and cried himself to sleep like a child at night.

How did he understand the collapse of his dream of an ideal Holy Alliance? Probably, he saw in it a sign that his noble intention was displeasing to Providence. Not displeasing in itself, but because he, a criminal, dared to come forward with this plan – he, a violator of the very foundations of moral order on the night of his ascension to the throne.

He constantly felt as though Providence was waiting for him to take some step, which he could not imagine. Obviously, as a ruler, he must redeem this sin through his activity. But is this the only sin? Are not the guilt of the whole dynasty, this "dark house of Atreus, where vengeance passes from head to head" also on his shoulders?

In 1812, he justified the hopes of his providence - he feels it undeniably. But before and after the war... What should he do? The Holy Alliance is obviously what should follow, but his action is not accepted from above: he is unworthy. Reforms?... Reforms...

Yes, here was a task that he could not solve. Here was the final drag given to the demon of the great power! Perhaps if Alexander's return from the Europe he liberated was marked by wide transformations; if the demon himself had destroyed the prison of Navna in the citadel of the conquerors, and his human machinery - the emperor - reflected this great act by limiting the rights of the autocrat and abolishing cruel prohibitions, opening the gates for the free expression of the people's will, then the sanction of the demiurge would not have been lifted from the demon of statehood. But Zhruutr became more and more autocratic. His rigidity grew, and the hope of involving him with the forces of Yarosvet was exhausted. His voice - what we call the logic of power and the state's common sense - coincided with the voice of inheritance and irrational fear of revolution. He had already told the sovereign that Alexander was wrong to embark on the path of reform; after his stay in the West, Alexander was finally convinced of this. This voice assured that the Matternikhov version of the Holy Alliance was still better than a new tour of European revolutions and Russia's fall into this flood. And this same voice contributed to the division of Alexander's life since 1816: on the one hand - Arakcheev, reaction, military settlements, Magnitsky - what could at least delay the storm whose thunder was heard from afar; on the other - a secret, tense, sorrowful life of the soul, its retreat into the inner space, tossing from idea to idea, deadly longing to understand, finally, its duty, to understand its obligation. I have no data to judge on which year the moment of clarity, the moment of clear understanding that the last reflection of divine rays over the anointed one and over the whole empire had gone out, occurred. It is only evident that it happened at the end of the reign.

But until it was accomplished, his religious life required some visible action, some perpetuation of his fervent faith, as a kind of gratitude to God for those heroic days of struggle against the foreign conqueror, when he felt (for only some year out of twenty-five years of his reign) that he was doing exactly what God wanted from him. And he set about fulfilling his vow, building a temple in memory of the Patriotic War. In the competition of projects, an extraordinary architectural sketch amazed him: mighty staircases rising from the river, deep cave halls - tombs of those who fell on the Borodino field, hiding behind rows of heavy columns at the edge of a high coastal ridge; above them, already on the crest - a spacious and solemn temple, and even higher - a magnificent rotunda with a royal dome raised like a golden peak in the blue sky. This was the project of Alexander Vitberg - young, almost unknown to anyone, not even a protégé of the Academy of Arts. And the emperor was moved by the one whose exquisite artistic sense, high taste, and aesthetic exaltation contributed to the rise of Russian architecture to its zenith, and turned the capital into one of the most beautiful cities in the world. The project was approved at the highest level, bypassing all the projects of famous academicians, and in 1817 on Vorobyovy Gory in Moscow, with the participation of several hundred hierarchs of the church, in the presence of the Tsar and with the gathering of five hundred thousand people after a solemn service, the temple of Body, Soul, and Spirit was laid.

But year passed after year, and the plan was not realized. The sandy soil of the Vorobyovy Gory could not withstand the weight of such a grand structure. Witberg was removed from the leadership of the construction, and work was suspended. The birch trees rustled and the desert fields whispered as before on the Vorobyovy Gory.
And him?

Internal anxiety drove him from place to place, from one palace to another, from city to city. In the blizzard and snowstorm, in the cold and heat, the imperial carriage raced, frightening passersby, through semi-wild provinces, through pitiful lowland towns, through military settlements stamped with the same face. One by one, years of mournful and solitary work of the spirit within oneself rose and fell behind the leaden horizon.

But a person with such a spiritual structure as Alexander's, a person whose conscience bled like from the greatest crime, from what another would step over without noticing; a person who had become convinced over twenty years of reign of the impossibility of illuminating state affairs with the light of higher principles; a person who realized the weight of religious and ethical duty on his shoulders for the entire dynasty and the whole country; a person who had long pondered over the highest truth of the monkish path, and therefore over the redemptive meaning of abdication from the throne - such a person's work of the spirit inevitably had to lead to a conclusion that would turn life upside down at its very foundations and lead fate out of the field of vision of history into a murky and mysterious distance.

### Chapter 4. Deed

"Statehood is burdened with original sin; it is impossible to illuminate it." This is the formula, it seems to me, in which he could clothe his subjective experience of ruling, involuntarily using the traditional concepts of Christianity.

He himself - both as a monarch and as a violator of ethical foundations for the sake of the well-being of himself and his state on the bloody night of March 12 - became a double carrier of this original sin of amoral statehood. He feels responsible for those who ruled before him and for those who are destined to rule in the future. Can he justify this responsibility by remaining on the throne? But any glorification of the state, which is generally achievable in practice, threatens to shake all bonds, to cause a revolutionary explosion, to bring about the collapse of everything. There are no objective ways to any other enlightenment, and even patricide would not give subjective right to that.

There is another truth - super-state. The only one in which he is unshakably convinced. Repentance - love - spiritual activity for humanity in the name of God.

What if: a solemn renunciation of the throne in favor of a monastery? But he is not Charles V. To turn the most intimate drama of fate and soul into a theatrical-mystical masquerade before the eyes of the whole world... Oh, anything but that! The monastery - yes, but to leave in such a way that no one suspects anything. To leave the power to those who are still young, full of strength, who do not know the pangs of conscience, who are not branded with a crime, who do not even suspect these terrible ethical and religious dilemmas. To leave! To leave as an unknown wanderer, on dusty roads, from village to village. How much solace would it bring him to beg for alms! But he is even denied that right. The richest of all monarchs on earth, in beggar's rags, begs for a penny from his subjects: what an unworthy comedy!... No. To confide in the secret of two or three people - without this, nothing can be arranged, including Empress Elizabeth. She will understand. She will justify and help. And to leave in such a way that all 40 million subjects think he has passed away. So that a closed empty coffin is lowered before everyone's eyes into the burial vault of the imperial house.

Once, in a moment of greatest danger for his country, he said that he would rather let his beard grow and go wandering along the roads than submit to the enemy. And now the time has come not for words, but for deeds. The enemy is no longer the emperor of the French, but the demon of a great power, but he will leave it in the same way. In a simple peasant's blouse or in a merchant's coat, he will make his way to the designated monastery. It is too early for him to take the monastic vows: first, he needs to become a novice. To submit to one of the ascetics who have become famous for their wisdom and purity of life. To pray for the rest of his life, purifying himself and atoning. To pray for Russia. For the sinful, bloody royal family. For their enlightenment, for their wisdom, and that the cup of retribution will pass over their grandchildren and great-grandchildren! And if this is not meant to be, let this small alms that he brings be counted for him in the afterlife judgment. For them! For everyone! For the whole nation, already covered by the shadow of something unknown, something incomprehensibly terrible that lies ahead.

Of course, his thought process could not have been exactly like this: I bring in shades that are inherent to my consciousness. There are no indications that he was aware of or clearly felt the existence of the demon of statehood and the demiurge as transphysical personalities, as hierarchies. In addition, the idea deeply rooted in church and denominational consciousness must have tormented him for a long time: the idea that the one anointed to reign does not have the right to voluntarily abdicate - never and under no circumstances - as this is equivalent to betraying the tasks assigned to him from above. Probably, this idea prevented him from taking the fatal step for a long time. It hindered him until he distinctly felt that God's blessing had been withdrawn from the forces that governed his state, and apparently forever. Presumably, only then did he feel entitled to step down. In any case, the direction of his mental process, the main milestones of his inner path, were apparently like this. This is evidenced by everything that preceded and followed.

Early autumn of 1825, the sun, golden foliage. And it was no longer the painful anxiety that made him wander around all the provinces and cities of the empire, but a carefully thought-out plan that brings him to Taganrog. The threshold of life is reached, an unprecedented turn of fate is taking place. No one is allowed to see the ruler except for the empress, the chief physician, and the chamberlain - enough time for the latter preparations. Then the coffin is brought in. A tall, elderly wanderer in the garb of a commoner, with a bag over his shoulder and a stick in his aristocratically small hand, sets out from Taganrog to the north. And in the palace - muted movements, rustling, whispering voices. They screw the lid on the coffin and pour it with lead. Russia is informed of the mournful event - the untimely death of Emperor Alexander. The court doctor is drawing the profile of the ruler on his deathbed: this should serve as proof in the capital that the emperor has indeed died and that his body is really in the coffin. And the coffin is being transported throughout Russia to be lowered with appropriate ceremonies into the burial vault of the imperial family in St. Petersburg.

Historical science has not yet pronounced its authoritative verdict on what still bears the strange name in literature: "The Legend of Elder Feodor Kuzmich."^^1 Apparently, the forces of the Zhurgrovs - both the second and the third - worked hard to create such a state of mind in the dynasty, society, and scientific circles, where the very assumption of Emperor Alexander's departure seemed fantastic. This is natural. In the eyes of the state church, such an act remained treachery, betrayal, and spiritual crime. In the eyes of the dynasty, it appeared as a formidable temptation for the people, a dangerous precedent, casting doubt on the legitimacy of all subsequent monarchs' reign and, in any case, casting doubt on the moral existence of the state. It is understandable that until the death of the second witzraor, serious scientific research on this issue was practically impossible. But when the Third Zhruutr took power in the transphysical layers of Russia, another, no less impressive obstacle arose: it was impossible to allow any of the overthrown dynasty's rulers to shine with the aura of heroism, self-sacrifice, and sanctity. And yet new data waiting for study are being discovered. Abroad, there are studies that are silenced here. After the revolution, science, becoming obedient to the slave of the third witzraor, hastened to discredit the names of many figures from the past, but few were treated as hostilely as Alexander I. His image was debunked, they sought to belittle, degrade, defile it, striving to make the very assumption of the reality of his departure psychologically absurd. Perhaps this was due to an intuitive guess that the new demon of great power had acquired in the person of this great spirit an irreconcilable and powerful enemy. The "legend" of Elder Feodor Kuzmich fell under a conspiratorial silence, and even the stunning historical fact that the coffin of Alexander I was empty when the tombs of the Peter and Paul Fortress were opened remained almost unknown to anyone.

^^1: The word "legend" is inappropriate here in any case, since it is not the historicity of Fedor Kuzmich himself that is called into scientific doubt, but rather his identity with Emperor Alexander.

I cannot go into the arguments in favor of this so-called legend here. I am not writing a historical study, but a metahistorical essay. The same person who saw a radiant giant flash before their inner vision in the aerial abysses; the one who received the meaning of the unique path that was taken a century ago with awe and reverence, that enlightened one could not be swayed in their knowledge by the lack of scientific evidence, or even their complete absence.

Oh, a hundred years ago, he was not at all like that. There is a portrait of old man Fyodor Kuzmich, painted by an inexperienced brush of a local (it seems, Tobolsk) artist. This document was published.^^2 It is more eloquent than any evidence. It is stunning.

Athonite Russian Panteleimon Monastery.

A huge, bald, semi-spherical skull. The remnants of hair above the ears, completely white, partially covering the ear shells. The forehead, on which the "hand of art" once inflicted a secret anger, is now almost menacing. The lips, clearly visible between the mustache and sparse beard, are compressed with indescribable grief. In the eyes fixed on the viewer, there is a severe thought and impenetrable mystery. These ashes-shrouded features glow with mournful wisdom, the same features that we all saw so many times in portraits of the emperor - exactly those. They have transformed to the extent and in the way that only years and the inner fire of a feat could transform them.

In order to "forge" this portrait, to intentionally (and for what purpose?) give the old man a deliberate resemblance to Alexander, and at the same time, to comprehend the entire logic of the spiritual tragedy of this king with such psychological depth, the unknown painter would have to possess the insight of a genius. But it is not only about genius, but even about modest talent: as a work of art, the portrait is almost illiterate.

I involuntarily begin to argue. I would like to use all means to pass on my knowledge to others. Because great rulers with such historical catharsis can hardly be counted in world history on more than one hand. Diocletian? But, having given up power, he did not go to the "wilderness," but simply retired to private life, like Sulla. Charles V? But even in the monastery of St. Justus, he did not forget state affairs, and his life there was surrounded by such comfort that any duke would envy. No, I remember some great rulers of India, truly great in spirit. Images of Chandragupta Maurya come to mind, the founder of the first Indian empire, who after a brilliant reign abdicated the throne, embraced the ascetic path of Jains, and ended his life with the self-sacrifice permitted by this religion: by refusing food. Another colossal figure of all times and peoples, Emperor Ashoka, after a crushing victory over the state of Kalinga, realized the sinfulness of killing man by man, announced his abandonment of the path of "world conquest" in favor of spreading piety, and after a long and perhaps the most glorious reign in history, took Buddhist monastic vows. But all these destinies are deeply individual. And I do not know the second story about the secret departure of the ruler of a powerful state and his death many years later in complete obscurity.

My fervent desire is for this to be finally understood. That is why I sometimes resort to historical arguments. But I should not do that, and I do not want to. That is the task of researchers. I can only point a little to the meta-historical meaning of some phenomena without any argumentation. Those years coincided with the last years of the life of a Russian saint, who can and should be placed alongside the great ascetics of distant times: the Venerable Seraphim of Sarov. His reputation spread throughout the country, and among the devotees of Sarov, a shepherd and miracle-worker, names with grand princely titles emerged.

At the end of 1825, an unknown middle-aged man arrived at the Sarov Monastery. He was confessed by the Venerable Seraphim, and the newcomer was accepted into the monastery as a novice under the name of Fedor. His origins and past remained unknown, apparently to anyone except the Venerable One.

Several years passed - enough time for the official version of the death of Emperor Alexander in Taganrog to firmly enter public consciousness. A few insiders kept the secret sacred: everyone understood that even revealing the slightest hint of it would mean the end of one's life in the casemates of Schlüsselburg or other even more mournful places. The events of December 14th were still fresh in everyone's memory, and any rumor capable of sowing doubt in the rights of Emperor Nicholas to the throne would have been nipped in the bud. Empress Elizabeth died. The new sovereign laid his hand on her letters and diaries, read them in complete solitude, and personally burned them in the fireplace.

He burned them in the fireplace. But some time passed, and he suddenly granted an audience to the Sarov Monastery, which was twelve hundred versts away from St. Petersburg. Walking with arshin steps, as always, puffing out his chest and looking ahead with a trembling gaze, he passed with his entourage into the modest church. In front of him stood a little hunchbacked old man in festive robes, with many small wrinkles and bright blue eyes that were so vibrant that he looked not seventy but seventeen. The Emperor bowed, and his fluffy, fragrant, well-groomed side-whiskers touched the hand of the holy man - pale, with fingers roughened from constant work, but strangely smelling of cypress.

After the solemn service and no less solemn feast, the sovereign retired to the cell of the abbot. And there, for two or three hours, a conversation between three people took place: Seraphim of Sarov, Nicholas I, and the one who now worked in Sarov under the humble name of novice Feodor. What did Nicholas feel when he saw his predecessor on the throne, his own brother, here, in the wilderness, disturbed only by the ringing of bells, in a simple black robe? As much as he was always intoxicated by his own greatness, in the first moment of the meeting, a mixed feeling of tremor, horror, sorrow, reverence, strange hope, and strange envy could not but pass over his soul. In spiritual tragedies of this kind, such as his brother's tragedy, he never believed, everything similar seemed to him either madness or comedy. Now - perhaps only for a few hours or even minutes - he realized that this was not a game or madness; and a vague joy that this incomprehensible seeker of God interceded for him and for the entire royal family stirred in him. What did they talk about? The situation excluded the possibility of insignificant topics or inquiries about everyone's personal life. The emperor did not overcome a thousand miles on horseback for this. Did Alexander Pavlovich persuade him to those transformations from which he once shied away himself? He walked a thousand miles from Taganrog to Sarov, not on horseback, and he knew and learned about his country not from the carriage window. And if the terrible sights of Russian life taught him a lot, then, certainly, first of all, that the refusal of immediate liberation of peasants is morally monstrous and politically absurd.

But what could this conversation lead to? No matter what Alexander asked for, what he pleaded with his brother, or how he tried to convey his hard-earned knowledge - how and what could reach the young autocrat, who was at the height of his power? - They spoke different languages.

The sovereign returned to St. Petersburg. The logic of power continued its uncompromising course. And that blindness, which politicians of that time considered to be the state's common sense and would probably have called state realism if that word had already been invented, continued to lead the empire to its end.

Of course, only on the eve of his departure could Emperor Alexander hope that an individual feat, or at least the spiritual work of all of Heavenly Russia, could abolish the karmic network of the dynasty and save it from inevitable retribution. When, long after leaving Sarov, he died in the depths of the Siberian taiga in old age, his consciousness was infinitely clearer, and he foresaw such depths and heights that he probably did not suspect at first.

We do not know what made him leave Sarov. Saint Seraphim passed away in 1832, and in the autumn of 1836, a poorly but neatly dressed, very tall man of advanced age rode up to one of the forges on the outskirts of the city of Krasnoyarsk. He asked to have his horse shod. But both his appearance and manner of speech seemed unusual and strange to the blacksmith and the people who had gathered there. He was detained and sent to the city jail, where he identified himself as a peasant named Fyodor Kuzmich but refused to give any further explanation and declared himself a wanderer with no recollection of his family. He was convicted of vagrancy and exiled to Siberia for settlement, after receiving twenty lashes of the whip as punishment. The designated place of settlement was the village of Zertsaly in Tomsk province.

Thus began his Siberian period of life, a long 28-year period. Cossacks, peasants, merchants, hunters, and priests all took a keen interest in his fate, for his wandering life, piety, medical assistance to the population, and religious conversations soon earned him a halo of righteousness and foresight. But he considered himself burdened with a great sin, and wherever he happened to live, he spent most of his time in prayer. He always carried several religious books, an icon of Alexander Nevsky, and a small ivory crucifix, which amazed everyone with its non-Russian style of workmanship. Fyodor Kuzmich never spoke about his past to anyone, not even to Bishop Innocent and Bishop Athanasius of Irkutsk, who showed him special respect. Only occasionally did his speeches strike his listeners with such a profound knowledge of the events of 1812 and such detailed memories of the life of the highest circles of Petersburg, which could only have been the province of their immediate participant.

Fedor Kuzmich died in 1864. It would be childish to speculate on what "other worlds" were revealed to him in his last years, and in what order he gained knowledge of their secrets. Each spiritual path is unique and largely incomparable; only the basic principles are universal and consistent. However, one of these principles is that the so-called "narrow path" (variants of which are found in all major religions) not only saves the ascending soul from the purgatories and torments of the afterlife, but also shortens its stay in the realms of enlightenment. For part of the work of illuminating the material veils of their monad, which most of us must perform beyond death, the seekers accomplish here. The degree of enlightenment achieved here determines the speed of ascent accomplished there.

With a light breath, barely touching the ground of those worlds, Alexander Blagoslovenny rose through the layers of Enlightenment to Heavenly Russia. There his creativity grew, and there awaited him the ladder of new and new enlightenments, while decades passed for us.

To the one who led the defending people in their hour of greatest danger and ensured the liberation of Europe, it was given to become the head of the enlightened forces of Russia in their struggle against the forces of anti-humanity, against the witzraors of our metaculture, and against Gagtungar himself.

Archistratig of the Heavenly Kremlin, he is still there now, in Holy Russia.
But his spiritual power, his brightness is increasing; he ascends higher and higher, he already enters the Heavenly Jerusalem - the blue shining pyramid, the highest Transmyth of Christianity.

To him who by his feat tore apart the loops and knots of royal karma on himself, it is destined in the future to become the liberator of those whom this karma has brought into centuries-old captivity: the giant prisoners in the citadels of Igvs and Witzraors.

To him who once laid the foundation of a great temple in the capital of Russia, which remained the unfulfilled second demon of the great power, it is given to lead, together with the immortal architect of this temple, the construction of a unique sanctuary: it will soon become the abode of Zventy-Sventana, the pure daughter of Yarosveta and the People's Soul.

He leads the battles that follow one after another between the Synclite of Russia and anti-humanity. But when the struggle of the demiurge with the demon of the great power ends with the liberation of Navna and  Zventa-Sventana, who will take on the enlightened flesh in the Heavenly Kremlin, he will leave the pinnacle of Russian metaculture to join the Synclite of the World - the spheres that have already seen him as a shining guest.

Riding as a bright misty horseman, whose approach raises in the corporeal realm of those worlds waves of power and joy that seem to sparkle, he rushes with angels, with daimons, with the armies of the Synclite to the walls of Drukkarg. He is a horseman, but his horse is beautiful and highly intelligent - one of the beings of the animal kingdom that has risen above Hangville. And the meaning of the roads they jointly conquer and the battles they jointly wage is the meaning of the alliance between enlightened humanity and the enlightened animal kingdom.

As Alexander untied the knots of his karma, what about his brother Nikolai? And the second witzraor, left by Yarosvet to himself? Drunk with victories, Zhruhr now faced the demiurge's will not as assistance, but as an annoying obstacle, and this provoked nothing in him but rage. A long era of struggle was beginning - the struggle that was destined to overflow across the boundaries of the super-people in the future and turn from the fight for Russia into the fight for the salvation of humanity.

Thus Nicholas I, an obedient tool of the demon of the great power, will repeat, without realizing it, the apostasy of Ivan the Terrible. Comparing these two historical figures may seem strange, but only to the historian; for the meta-historian, it is justified and logical. Different cultural and historical epochs, epochal climates, dissimilar political situations, the different personalities of both witzraors, and finally, the contrast of the characters of both tsars... yes, they are so great that they overshadow the common essence hidden in their destiny and meta-historical significance.

These two characters seem especially dissimilar. After all, it is possible to tyrannize in different ways, in different styles, so to speak... And yet, these differences are only on the surface. When enraged Nicholas directed his coldly bright-eyed gaze with two black pupils at his subject, the unfortunate man froze and petrified just as the boyar or the serf did under the hawkish gaze of Ivan the Terrible.

When Nikolai, playing the role of an incomprehensible monarch in his magnanimity and the loftiness of his aspirations, and believing in this farce himself, reduced Ryleyev to repentant sobs and made the wise and incorruptible Pushkin sing praises to Peter the Great's great-grandson, doesn't the sadistic theatricality of Ivan IV come to mind? Didn't they both believe, with a prideful and intoxicating faith, in the magnificent formula "God in heaven, and I on earth"? Didn't they both hold themselves in high regard as shepherds of the souls and bodies of the people, elevated and alone in their knowledge of what the flock needs and what it doesn't, what is beneficial and what is harmful?

Nikolai I and Ivan IV epitomized the zenith of the power of the demon of autocracy - firstly; their initiation of the struggle against the demiurge of the super-people - secondly; the pushing of the tyrannical tendency to the extreme - thirdly; and the beginning of the process of state destruction - fourthly. The Crimean War constitutes a synchronous parallel to the unsuccessful Polish and Livonian wars at the end of Ivan the Terrible's reign. The Terrorist- suffocating regime of Nikolai corresponds to the Oprichnina, with the role of the nobility, which was advanced by Ivan through the Oprichnina, now played by the bureaucracy. The suicide of Nikolai, who survived until the beginning of the collapse of his structure, parallels the terrible death of Ivan the Terrible. Of course, it is not essential that one voluntarily accepted poison, while the other fiercely resisted his end in a panic-stricken fear; what is important is that both of these deaths are the brightest examples of two spiritual-state bankruptcies.

## Book X. On the Meta-History of Russian Culture

### Chapter 1. The Gift of Heraldry

In one of the previous chapters, I was forced to note that no major thinkers emerged on the cultural horizon of medieval Russia. This long period was also not very rich in artistic geniuses. However, never again did the Russian metaculture shine with such a large number of saints and righteous people. It is also well known that this righteousness was predominantly of the ascetic and monastic type, in accordance with the ethical traditions bequeathed by Orthodox Byzantium. From the point of view of these traditions, any other type of human activity could only have relative and fleeting value. The role of the leaders of the state - the great princes and tsars - was recognized, but it was considered fruitful and correct only to the extent that it was in accordance with the precepts proclaimed by the highest moral authority of those times: the throne of the metropolitan and patriarch, the ascetic monastery, and the cell. It is characteristic that when dying, the tsar took monastic vows, thereby signifying the soul's entry into the highest stage of spiritual life.

In the 18th century, the depletion of spiritual streams that nourished the roots of Orthodox righteousness became evident. There were fewer prominent religious figures, and society saw fewer figures of pure and high spiritual leaders who illuminated their own hearts and subdued their own nature. In the 19th century, only a few individuals, such as Saint Seraphim of Sarov, Theophan the Recluse, Ambrose, and Makary of Optina, resembled the images of those saints that the land was so rich in during previous centuries. Finally, in the pre-revolutionary era, the church horizon became completely desolate. Moreover, this reduction in the scale of personality was just one manifestation of the overall creative impoverishment of Orthodoxy. Year after year, the church fell further behind the demands and requests of rapidly changing eras, and this lag was even elevated to a certain principle: the church hierarchy viewed itself as the keeper of immutable and exhaustive truths, independent of changing times and human psychology. However, since this view was not supported by the impeccable life of the pastors themselves, the intensity of their spiritual work, or their wise responses to social, political, or philosophical questions raised by new eras, the authority and importance of the church rapidly declined. The last spiritual efforts from the church were met with the storm of the Revolution. A whole series of nameless heroes and martyrs emerged, and at the end of their life paths, the creative spirit left the Orthodox Church even more. As it became a pawn in the hands of diplomatic politicians, the leadership of the Eastern Christian community turned into an accomplice and instrument of the anti-religious state.

But as the church lost its importance as the spiritual leader of society, a new institution emerged that took on this duty and, through its most prominent representatives, clearly understood this responsibility. This institution was the heraldry.

A herald is someone who, inspired by a daimon, allows people to feel the highest truth and light flowing from other worlds through the images of art in the broadest sense of the word. Prophecy and heraldry are similar concepts, but they are not the same. The herald acts only through art, while a prophet can fulfill his mission through other means - through oral preaching, religious philosophy, and even through the image of his entire life. On the other hand, the concept of heraldry is close to the concept of artistic genius, but it is not the same. Genius is the highest degree of artistic talent. Most geniuses were also heralds to some extent, but not all. Moreover, many heralds possessed not artistic genius, but only talent.

The century that passed from the Patriotic War to the Great Revolution was truly a century of artistic geniuses. Each of them, especially the literary geniuses, ruled the thoughts of entire generations, and society looked at them as teachers of life. The greatly increased educational and teaching role of literature, thanks to them, was expressed, of course, in the activities of many talents; the influence of some of them became even more intense and broader than the influence of their brilliant contemporaries. From the 1860s, it became clear, even though society was not fully aware of it, that the influence of geniuses and the influence of talents were, in a very profound sense, opposed to each other. The artistic geniuses of that time - Tyutchev, Leo Tolstoy, Dostoevsky, Chekhov, Mussorgsky, Tchaikovsky, Surikov, and later Vrubel and Blok - did not put forward any social or political programs capable of satisfying the mass demands of the era. They inspired the minds, hearts, and wills of their followers not in terms of horizontal social transformations but in terms of vertical depths and heights of spirituality; they revealed the spaces of the inner world and pointed to the unshakable vertical axis. Talents, at least the most influential of them, increasingly put before the consciousness of generations the problems of social and political action. These were Herzen, Nekrasov, Chernyshevsky, Pisarev, all the sixties, Gleb Uspensky, Korolenko, Mikhailovsky, Gorky. Talents as messengers, such as Leskov or Aleksei Konstantinovich Tolstoy, remained isolated units; they, so to speak, rowed against the current, without encountering among their contemporaries either proper understanding or fair evaluation.

Just as Ivan the Terrible, despite the scale of his personality, must be recognized as a figure who is immense but not great, because he lacks one of the signs of true greatness - magnanimity, in the same way, a number of artists, whom many of us apply the epithet "genius" to, are not and have never been messengers. Because their artistic activity lacks one of the main signs of being a messenger: the sense that they and through them, a higher instance beyond them, speaks. For example, French literature is rich in such names, and we can name two or three figures from the revolutionary era in our own country: Gorky, Mayakovsky. One can argue with the genius of these writers, but it is unlikely that anyone would see them as messengers of a higher reality.

The truths of higher reality are refracted by the subordinate reality of Enrof. If a person is entrusted with the mission of preaching these truths and their refractions, the duty of their preaching is the language of artistic images. If a daemon is sent to an artist for this purpose, the artist cannot help but feel (to a greater or lesser extent) its inspiring influence. The nature of this feeling and the ways of expressing it can vary, but at its core, there is always an experience of some force outside the artist's personality, invading him and expressing itself in his creative process. Sometimes, such an experience is familiar even to people with less talent, whom we cannot classify as geniuses. An example of such an excellent, albeit not genius poet, is A. K. Tolstoy. Few geniuses of poetry have been able to express this feeling with such clarity and definiteness as Alexei Tolstoy did in his amazing poem: "In vain, artist, do you think that you are the creator of your creations." One such poem would probably be enough to make it clear and undeniable to us what a gift of preaching this poet possessed. And yet, in terms of the depth of transphysical insight, this poem is far from some of A. Tolstoy's other masterpieces. Who else in Russian literature has expressed with such clarity, reasonableness, power, and ardor as Tolstoy did in his "John of Damascus" the idea that art in general and the art of words in particular can be an expression of the highest reality, the supreme Truth, the breath of other worlds, and that a poet who fulfills his gift of preaching thereby performs what he is destined for by divine powers? And isn't his poem "The Dragon" the first attempt in Russian literature to depict the image and clarify the meta-historical role of demonic beings like Witzraors? I won't even mention his "Don Juan", for the disclosure of the transphysical concept of which a special work would be required, or such a pearl of Russian lyrics as the poem "A Tear Trembles in Your Jealous Gaze".

All this explains the difference between the concept of artistic genius and the concept of prophetic vision. We see talented artists who did not claim the genius perfection of their creations, but proclaimed with them about such heights and depths of the otherworldly spheres that many geniuses were unable to reach. On the other hand, many figures firmly convinced of their own genius are only carriers of talent. One inconspicuous but irrefutable sign gives them away: they feel their creative process not as a manifestation of some superhuman principle, but precisely as their own, only their own prerogative, even merit, like an athlete who feels the strength of his muscles belonging only to him and obeying only his will. Such claimants to genius are boastful and inclined to glorify themselves. At the beginning of the 20th century, for example, in Russian poetry one could often come across high-sounding declarations of their own genius.

In the beginning of the 20th century, for example, in Russian poetry, one could often come across pompous declarations of their own genius.

    "I am the refinement of Russian slow speech,
    Before me all other poets are forerunners..."

exclaimed one. Another, paraphrasing Horace, erased the name of the great Roman from the pedestal and in letters falling to the right, then to the left, then phonetically colliding with each other, wrote his own:

    "...and people of different tastes...
    all will call me: Valery Bryusov."
    "I am the genius Igor Severyanin,
    Intoxicated by my victory..."

raved the third.

    "My verse will step over the ridges of centuries
    And over the heads of poets and governments..."

asserted the fourth, replacing the possible with the desirable.

Each of these declarators is convinced that genius is a quality inherent to their personality, even their achievement. Like teenagers who feel stronger than their peers, they proudly strain their poetic biceps and look down from above at the rest of the kids. All of this is talent blinded by themselves, masters creating in their own name, slaves of self. They are not geniuses, but self-proclaimed geniuses. Like self-proclaimed kings of our history, some of them managed to reach the literary throne and hold it for several years, one even for nearly three decades. But the judgment of time subjected them to ruthless exposure every time, and posterity relegated these names to their appropriate modest places, and personal karma, burdened by pride and self-blinding, complicated by lowering moral demands on oneself ("I am allowed more than anyone else because I am above all") - carried such a personality far away from Synclite of metaculture after their death.

I would be completely misunderstood if anyone tried to draw the conclusion from my words that I am preparing the reader to not be surprised by the requirement that I will present on the following pages to any artist: that their creations must necessarily reflect an ethical tendency guided by religious and moral ideas. Before making any "demands," I take care to characterize not what should be, but what actually exists as a fact. It is precisely for this purpose that I introduce the concept of heraldry, separating it from the concepts of genius and talent. It would be ridiculous and absurd to demand that every artist strive to be like a herald just because it is characteristic of a herald. Genius and talent themselves, not combined with the gift of heraldry, are also divine gifts, but conferred differently and containing different potentials. The transphysical difference between a mere genius or talent and a herald is a greater or lesser, but always personal giftedness of nature; talent and even genius are such universal abilities that have reached the highest degree of development in a given individual than in others, due to the peculiarities of their psycho-physical structure; and these peculiarities are teleologically conditioned by the formative work of certain Providential forces over the shell, the astral, the ether, and the physical body. No daemon is sent to such an artist, no muse whispers anything to him, and no invisible being works to open the organs of his spiritual perception. Such a person, whether talented or genius, cannot experience the superpersonal nature of their inspirations for the simple reason that there is no such superpersonal nature in these inspirations. If we encounter such statements in the mouth of a young person who has not yet reached the zenith of their talent, then one of three things must be assumed: either this is really a young herald, or we are dealing with a gifted person who has adopted the pose of a herald, consciously or unconsciously copying their appearance.

Talent and even genius have not a mission, but a duty, like every person, but a series of deeply individual characteristics distinguish this duty from others. Mission always has a general, very broad significance, and the entire metaculture is deeply interested in its implementation. In order for an artist to be a messenger, more intense, prolonged efforts of Providence forces are required, an incessant, long-term work on the material coverings of their Monad from the side of Cherubim, Daimons, Elementals, Demiurge of the super-nation and their Cathedral Soul, from the side of the Synclite of metaculture and the Synclite of the World. Because the opening of the spiritual organs of their being - without this, the messengerhood is impossible - is an extremely laborious process, more laborious than the delivery of any powerful artistic genius.

As for genius or talent themselves, they can be completely free from assignment - to proclaim and show through the magical crystal of art the highest reality. It is enough to remember Titian or Rubens, Balzac or Maupassant. Only the demands of universal ethics and the condition that their gift should not be buried in the ground or used for evil, that is, not to deprave the spirit, are not removed from them. Only with such demands can we approach the evaluation of the life and work of, say, Flaubert or Wells, Mayakovsky or Yesenin, Korolenko or Gorky, Repin or Venetsianov, Dargomyzhsky or Lyadov, Monferran or Tonne. Thus, ethical requirements imposed on talent or genius are requirements of the universal ethical minimum.

In this case, isn't our demand on the messenger a demand for ethical maximum? - one might think. But the point is that we have no right to demand anything from anyone that exceeds the ethical minimum. We could only demand from the messenger to abide by the norms of ethical minimum in their life and creative work. It's not about our demands, but about the demands of those whose greatest efforts have given the gift of journalism to this artist. And apparently, these demands in some cases turn out to be more lenient than our own could be, and in other cases, much more severe. Individual violations of even the universal moral minimum by the messenger can be left without consequences in some cases, but any betrayal, distortion, or confusion of the mission entails the most severe consequences. Creating "The Maid of Orleans" burdened Voltaire's karma immeasurably more than dozens of his disgraceful deeds in his personal life.

"Genius and wickedness are two incompatible things." It's hard to say, looking at historical facts, whether this is true or not. In any case, with serious flaws, deep falls, many minor weaknesses, even with transgressions against elementary moral norms, artistic genius is not only compatible but in most cases, genius is not even capable of bypassing all of this, at least in youth. People like Mozart, who lived an amazingly pure life, are phenomenally rare: these are beings that have never been embodied as human beings, only as angels, and therefore, their demonic yetzerhare is not contained in a shell, but only in the ethereal-physical tissues of the beings inherited from humans - their parents.

There are geniuses who create their human image, and there are geniuses who destroy it. The former, having gone through all kinds of setbacks and failures in their youth, enrich the experience of their soul and gradually free themselves from the gravity of downward and backward tendencies, outlive the tendency towards self-destruction, and in old age present an example of a personality that becomes increasingly harmonized, having transformed memories of their falls into wisdom and understanding of good and evil. These are Dante, Leonardo, Cervantes, Goethe, Wagner, and in our country, Dostoevsky. The limits of such harmonization of personality were reached by Leo Tolstoy in the last days of his life. Pushkin, Lermontov, and Chekhov were moving in this direction, evidently. The premature death of many geniuses does not allow one to determine with certainty the potential outcomes of their paths. The history of culture knows carriers of artistic genius or great talent who represented a harmonious personality from the very beginning, although not to the same degree as Mozart: Bach, Gluck, Liszt, Tulsi Dao, Tagore, and in Russia - Alexei K. Tolstoy. It also knows such ones, like Michelangelo, who even in old age could not bring different aspects of their personality into harmony with each other or their personality with their mission.

But there are also a number of geniuses from the descending line, tragic geniuses who fell victim to the unresolved internal contradiction: Francois Villon and Baudelaire, Gogol and Mussorgsky, Glinka and Tchaikovsky, Verlaine and Blok. The tragedy of each of them is not only infinitely individual, but also so deep, exceptional, and mysterious that touching upon the mysteries of their destinies can only be done with the greatest care, with chastity and love, with tremulous gratitude for what we have learned from them, least of all guided by the desire to pass some ethical verdict on these great unfortunates. "To whom much is given, from him much will be required", yes. But let Him who gave ask of them, not us. We only learned from their tragedies, we only took, only read the poems written by their life catastrophes, in which the multi-level warning meaning is so clearly revealed, as never before and in nothing.

    I do not hide from you,
    Look at me:
    Here I am standing among the ruins
    Burnt by the tongues
    Of the underworld fire...

Truly: their judge - "only God and conscience".

Of course, the great "Monkey God" is not idle in this area. If there are messengers of Providence, it is easy to guess that the cultural-historical process does not go without dark messengers. True, in the field of art, such messengers are not often encountered, and having met them, their true nature is not immediately recognized. They rarely speak openly and directly about the mysteries of the demonic element: why would Gagtungar need to reveal to human sight its own pitch darkness through such messengers? More often, the activity of dark messengers has a negative character: they expose and ridicule spirituality in history, art, religion, life, and in the human soul. It rarely occurs to anyone that the brilliant, charmingly frivolous Parny carried out (probably unconsciously or semi-consciously) a dark mission: by clothing blasphemy in an enchanting poetic form, he thereby lowered religious values, discredited the manifestations of the World Feminine, invalidated spiritual aspirations in human hearts, and exposed ethical ideals.

However, dark messengers are more often encountered not in art, but in philosophy and science. For example, Bacon, one of the first to establish a complete and final separation of science from any ethics and any spirituality; Cont, who opposed all existing religions with his religion of the "left hand" - his rational, emaciated, deadening-cold "Cult of Humanity", based on a whole system of slippery and heart-revealing substitutions. Similarly, Stirner, whose "ethical" system undermines the roots of any morality with the knife of the highest criterion "I want"; Nietzsche, who distorted and profaned the ideal of combining in one free personality the highest talent with the highest power and highest righteousness, which should have been realized by the consciousness of his era, if not for him; Marx, who seized upon one of the gears of the transmission mechanism, which is the economy, and proclaimed its uniqueness and supremacy. In science, the dark messengers, the bearers of dark missions, are not the great names, the geniuses, but the secondary scientists, interpreters, and distorters of profound scientific theories, such as Timiryazev, who popularized and reduced Darwin's teachings to the fullest materialistic plane.

In art (as well as in science), there are also such dark messengers who are devoid of dark missions and become the heralds of darkness simply as a result of personal delusions. Skryabin can serve as a vivid example of such a figure. He believed in God and loved Him in his own way, considered himself His messenger and even a prophet, but with astonishing ease he made substitutions, became a victim of his own spiritual lack of control and turned into a messenger of Duggur. Few people understand that in "The Poem of Ecstasy", for example, that demonic layer is depicted with striking frankness, with its mystical sensuality, its mass sexual acts, its transfer of the impulse of lust to the cosmic plane, and most importantly, it is depicted not from an exposing and warning point of view, but as an ideal. Naturally, the sensitive listener of "The Poem of Ecstasy", at first embarrassed and then mesmerized by this sound panorama of cosmic totality, towards the end feels an inner demagnetization and profound prostration.

In specific conditions of the real historical and cultural process, often, and especially in the 19th century, an unquenchable feeling of religious and ethical mission in the soul of a messenger comes into conflict with the real possibilities of his epoch and with the artistic "categorical imperative" inherent in his gift. Andrei Rublev and the builders of the Cathedral of Basil the Blessed did not know such a conflict because their artistic inclinations completely coincided with the concrete possibilities of the epoch and with their own religious and ethical mission. As for the latter, they were able to overcome the unfavorable psychological climate of their time and had the fortune to realize that their creations - the more they matured and aged - spoke precisely about those heights of spirituality, which these artists were messengers of, and warned of those abysses that they were given to contemplate and about which they were bequeathed to warn.

The internal conflict that I am speaking of is a triple contradiction, a struggle of three tendencies: the religious-ethical-preaching tendency, the self-dominating-aesthetic tendency, and another that can be called the tendency of lower freedom: the desire of the individual to realize their universal rights to an ordinary life unencumbered by higher normative standards, encompassing the right to weaknesses, passions, and well-being. This internal conflict was clearly outlined by Pushkin. The chain of his poems, among which "When the noise of life will silence for a mortal", "Fathers hermits and wives immaculate", "Prophet", "There, to the clouded cell" and others shimmer with such striking evidence of the call to spiritual asceticism, which grew stronger in the poet's soul from year to year, that only those who have never heard this call in their own soul can fail to understand it. This internal conflict was exacerbated in Lermontov, was experienced with incredible intensity by Gogol and Leo Tolstoy, and turned Blok's fate into a tragedy of spiritual decline. However, I will talk about this in more detail in the following chapters.

It may be said: indeed, such contradictions were inherent in some of the leading figures of Russian literature. But here we have other literatures. How often do we find similar conflicts there? How many of the carriers of great artistic talent were aware of their mission as some kind of synthesis of artistic creativity and spiritual feat?

An exhaustive answer to this question would, of course, require a separate and very voluminous work. Within the framework of the book provided to me, however, only the following can be noted.

First of all, much depends on which literature we consider. Certainly, ancient tragedy, for example, is marked by, if not a clear understanding, then at least a persistent sense of the necessity to proclaim and assert the reality of a higher order. Persian poetry, represented by Ferdowsi, Saadi, Nizami, Rumi, is a constellation of mystical geniuses, teachers of the soul. All Indian literature, from Vedic hymns to Rabindranath Tagore, is an ocean of religious and ethical revelations expressed in the language of artistic images. There are no exceptions among the geniuses of Western medieval literature, from Echenbach to Dante and Petrarch, or among the geniuses of Spain - Cervantes and Calderon, or the great poets of England - Shakespeare, Milton, Shelley, Coleridge, and Keats, not to mention the luminaries of German and Scandinavian literature. Truly exceptional in this regard is French literature, astonishingly poor in its messianism. But this is closely related to France's overall meta-historical tragedy. As early as the 16th century, its spirit-nation-builder raised something akin to a rebellion against the demiurgic plan. Apparently, he wished that the French witzraor, born shortly before, was sanctioned from above for the union of Roman Catholic peoples based not on Catholicism, but on French statehood. This demand caused his removal, and France remained without direct leadership. Its Synclite, remaining in Eden, merged with the Synclite of the Apostle Peter, but after that only a few rose from France, others joined Monsalvat. Hence, the progressive spiritual impoverishment that is noticeable to meta-history when examining French culture already in the 17th century. Later, it finds its expression in literature and in the philosophical attempts of the era of the encyclopedists - phenomena that speak of the regrettable domination of reason, emaciated from any spirituality and even consciously opposing it. This is not the place to explain the extraordinarily complex knot of meta-historical processes that was the French Revolution. In connection with the theme of this chapter, it is only necessary to note that those civic ideals of "freedom, equality, and brotherhood," those "Rights of Man" which began their triumphant march around the world precisely from France, were an attempt by the demiurge of the Roman Catholic metaculture, with the participation of his brother, the demiurge of the Northwest, to raise this leaderless people with those ideals which were more organic to them. But the growing emptiness of the transphysical layers above France made it increasingly vulnerable to all sorts of demonic influences. The distortion of the proclaimed ideals and their substitution with revolutionary tyranny began just a few weeks after the storming of the Bastille. A whole group of people with dark missions appeared on the stage, and the furious frenzy that flooded France was a vivid proof of the power of demonic forces that invaded its stratosphere from Gashsharvy. The disaster was not limited to bloodshed in France alone; it acquired global significance because the entire spiritual and ideological flow that had rushed from this country across the lands of Europe had been poisoned. The largest carrier of dark missions of that era was, of course, Napoleon, whose dual task was to replace international liberation and civil ideas with the ideas of solitary tyranny and to increase the clubs of Gawakh through continuous international bloodshed.[1] Gradually, France found itself in a vacuum between two metacultures, two synclites. As for French literature, its descent down the steps of spiritual decline was finally determined in the 19th century. No matter how highly we might appreciate the level of artistic talent of Balzac, Flaubert, Maupassant, and France, we will not find any sign of prophecy in their works; it is only reflected in the works of very few writers of the late period of France: Chateaubriand, Hugo, perhaps Mallarme. The last author, over whose works the reflected glow of prophecy still sometimes flickered, was apparently Romain Rolland.

____________
[1]: The one who was Napoleon was born several centuries earlier with a similar mission of "increasing suffering" in the Abbasid Caliphate. After his apotheosis as the Emperor of the French, he spent several years on the Day, then in Gashsharve, where he was being prepared for his third dark mission: the creation of a left-handed religion in Germany. If this had succeeded, Hitler's tasks would have been greatly facilitated, and Napoleon himself, falling to the bottom for the third time, would have experienced a failure in Sufetkh and a fall from Shadanikar. Fortunately, he was rescued from Gashsharve; among those involved were, among other things, Saint Louis and Joan of Arc.

Such are the meta-historical circumstances that lead the contemplator of French literature to gloomy and anxious conclusions. In any case, this literature, with its combination of high artistic quality and low level of spirituality, with its weakly expressed prophetic voice, is an exception among world literatures.

And, however, it is also true that no literature has expressed as vividly, deeply, and tragically as Russian literature the feeling of the spiritual fact that it is not enough for the messenger to be a great artist. In this respect, Russian literature really stands apart. I am not evaluating this circumstance yet, but only pointing out as a historical fact. Not only our geniuses, but also many carriers of less talent expressed this idea in their own way. Sometimes it took the form of a demand for a civil or even political feat: this call is heard in Radishchev, Ryleev, Herzen, Nekrasov, the sixties, the populists, and so on up to the Bolsheviks. Sometimes they tried to combine artistic activity with the preaching of Orthodoxy: it started with the Slavophiles and Gogol and ended with Dostoevsky. Finally, the word artists felt, searched for, and either found or struggled in wandering through the desert for the highest synthesis of religious-ethical and artistic service. Not to mention Gogol and Leo Tolstoy, let us also remember and contemplate Alexey Tolstoy, Garshin, Vladimir Solovyov, Blok, and Vyacheslav Ivanov; let us recall the breakthroughs of cosmic consciousness reflected in the works of Lomonosov, Derzhavin, and Tyutchev; let us find in ourselves enough insight to see the readiness to take the first step on the spiritual path in the prematurely terminated biographies of Griboedov, Pushkin, and Lermontov; in the images of Leskov's righteous men and in the fervent faith of this religious painter; let us pay attention to the deep feeling and understanding of Christ in Leonid Andreev, which he tried to express in a number of works, and first of all, in his remarkable "Judas Iscariot," a feeling that was constantly struggling in the soul of this writer with an understanding of the dark, demonic nature of the world's law, and this last idea, so profound as only the ideas of messengers can be, found expression in the drama "The Life of Man" as clearly as the artistic, not philosophical or meta-historical nature of the soul of this writer (2) allowed the conditions of the era. Let us follow the same messenger trend, albeit distorted, in the anthroposophical teachings of Andrei Bely; in the delusional ideas of Khlebnikov about the transformation of the Earth and in his insane dreams of becoming the ruler of the globe for this purpose; in the civil feat of Gumilev, who plunged deeper into religiosity; in the high attempt of Maximilian Voloshin to define his personal line as an artist and contemporary of revolutions and great wars with a religious-ethical commandment: "In the days of revolution, be a man, not a citizen."

> (2): In one of his previous incarnations, L. Andreev lived in Palestine where he was a prominent merchant. It was the era of emperors Augustus and Tiberius. Regarding Jesus Christ, Andreev essentially only heard about him, but there was one occasion when he saw Jesus from afar on a street in Jerusalem. The Savior was walking with a group of disciples. The encounter lasted only a few seconds and Andreev did not know who it was, but Jesus' face struck him and stayed in his memory forever.

Some will say: it's good that this perfect image was only a fleeting vision; it's just a shame that the futile yearning for it deprived us of the artistic creations that Gogol and Tolstoy would have produced if it hadn't been a mere illusion in front of them. Let them be silent about what they do not know! With an unceasing spiritual vision and hearing from cradle to grave, with a wingless imagination crawling in the dust, what do they know about that radiant stream of unprecedented creations, surpassing all that has been created before, that would have flowed from the spirit of an artist who truly became a prophet, rather than just in a dream? Let them be silent. Let them listen to what the knowledgeable say. No one dares to judge Icarus for his crazy flight, just as no one dares to judge the sun for melting his wings.

Do they not think that this upward surge of the waves of culture, passing through one and a half centuries of great Russian literature, is the result of chance? If it is chance, what is the law? But if it is not chance, but an echo of a mighty voice heard as an inner categorical imperative by the carriers of the deepest talents of our Golden Age, then in what connection with the ultimate goals of the Russian super-nation does this voice remain? Where does it come from? From the mouth of the demiurge, inspiring his messengers with what must be? From the transmyth of Christianity, where the foreknowledge of the coming and concluding epochs of humanity is hidden - those epochs of the greatest struggle between two principles, when the Russian super-nation and its Synclite must fulfill their planetary mission? What ideals of life in the historical distance of the future did it anticipate, leading Russian creators to the synthesis of artistic and religious service? And what meta-historical meaning can be read in their turbulent, sinful and sparkling lives, in their exceptional destinies?

### Chapter 2. Missions and Destinies

Everything that the demiurge Yarosvet creates, everything in which his influence on the historical layer manifests itself, is directly or indirectly related to his supreme task, the realization of which must justify the thousand-year path of the agonizing and terrible formation of a super-people. I have already spoken about this task, to the extent that it is comprehensible and expressible in the language of our concepts, but I will repeat it again. Meta-historically, this task-goal consists in the birth of Zventy-Sventana by the demiurge and the Ideal Cathedral Soul of the Russian super-people; historically, it is manifested in the appearance of the Rose of the World, that is, such a religious-moral institution that, by showing itself as an image of unstained purity, aesthetic wealth, and broad cultural understanding, would gain the highest authority in the eyes of the peoples of the world, and through a worldwide referendum would take ethical control over the activities of all member states of the World Federation, and gradually, by forming a diverse system of cultural means of generation of people of a refined image, would create a prerequisite - not for softening already, but for the complete transformation of the very essence of the state into a universal brotherhood of all mankind.

Obviously, in the 17th century, it became clear to demiurgic wisdom that religious wisdom of humanity was understood much later: that the Russian Orthodox Church, which had guided society spiritually for so many centuries, was incapable of understanding its ultimate goal, the transphysical meaning of its existence was elsewhere, and that it was time to put forward a new force on the path to this goal.

Orthodoxy, as a doctrine and practice, was formed mainly in Byzantium, at long past stages of the collective cultural consciousness. Naturally, it could not subsequently free itself from some archaic primitivism, from a certain narrowness and narrow-mindedness of cultural consciousness and social thinking. This type of consciousness and thinking had to give way to a new type of thinking and consciousness - the one proclaimed by artistic geniuses and the deepest talents of Russia, transforming through them into a new historical factor of paramount importance.

Without exactly what premises, the upcoming task of Zventy-Sventana would be insoluble, which I have designated for brevity and only for brevity as the transformation of states into a brotherhood? Let us list some of these premises, the most important, obvious, and simple ones.

Firstly, this transformation is impossible until barriers between world religions are eliminated or at least reduced; until such a religious perspective is acquired, under which Christian dogmatics and the dogmatics of other religions of the right hand will not exclude each other, but complement each other; so that the Rose of the World could unite all Christian churches on new principles, and bring other religions closer to itself on the basis of a free union.

Secondly, the transformation of the essence of the state is impossible within any local boundaries: if such a process occurred in one state, and the others continued to exist, they would forcibly seize and absorb this brotherhood that emerged among them. Therefore, the task is insoluble until universal fragmentation is overcome, until a world state is created. This is impossible without the emergence and consolidation of a new attitude towards the state, social structure, and phenomena such as borders, wars, and dictatorships in the consciousness of Russia and all humanity. Such conditions must be created that will allow the rapid development of the need for all-human unity, aversion to violence, and horror of tyranny. Ironically, the development of these feelings in humans is partly due to the witzraors themselves: the horror of tyranny can be known only to those who have experienced tyranny on themselves or near themselves; aversion to violence is most characteristic of victims of violence; the need for all-human unity is for those for whom fragmentation has become intolerable. Thus, the activity of the witzraors and anti-humanity itself caused the dialectical state of people, which was a precondition for the paralysis and defeat of the witzraors. However, to raise the tone of this state to such a level that it becomes one of the psychological reasons for universal unity and the end of world fragmentation, the world would have to go through a stage of overdevelopment of states into types of tyrannies-tormentors, punishment systems into unprecedented mass repressions, and wars into the tragedy of the destruction of entire countries and peoples. But even then, there would be a risk that the apparatus of tyranny would be stronger than the sum of active protests generated by it. Therefore, the efforts of the demiurge - or rather, all the demiurges of humanity - must inevitably be directed towards strengthening in people a complex of feelings and ideas actively aimed at combating tyranny, overcoming fragmentation, and uniting everyone.

Thirdly, the transformation of the essence of the state is impossible until a certain level of universal material prosperity is achieved, and the right of every person to such prosperity becomes an unshakable axiom. To achieve this, on the one hand, stable class, national, and social antagonisms and prejudices must be completely eradicated, the sense of social compassion must be aroused and the consciousness of supra-class, supra-national rights must be instilled in generations. On the other hand, progress in science and technology must be maximally accelerated, and Providential assistance must be given to the development of corresponding intellectual and volitional qualities in humans, despite the fact that Gagtungar's intervention in this process is expanding the gap between the levels of human technology and human ethics every decade.

Fourthly, the transformation of the essence of the state is impossible without society firmly realizing the wickedness of this old essence; therefore, considerable efforts must be made to expose this essence.

Fifthly, the transformation of the state into a brotherhood is impossible until the contradiction between two fundamental cultural tendencies is resolved: the ascetic spiritual tendency that rejects the world and the tendency that affirms the world, the carnal, so-called "pagan" tendency. This duality of nature must be recognized: as a source of joy, happiness, and Light on one hand, and as an arena for the raging of demonic forces on the other hand. Nature must be seen as an object of high moral and creative duty, must be embraced with active love, and a spiritual and physical friendliness must be established towards the bright worlds of the elementals.

And finally, the triumph of the Rose of the World is impossible until a new, deeper meaning is revealed in the religious quest for the Eternal Feminine principle, and until the influence of Zvonta-Sventana has softened and illuminated the excessive harshness of the masculine principle that has dominated ethics, religion, and society up to this point. There were, of course, a number of other historical prerequisites - not to mention metahistorical ones - that had to be met before the main task could be accomplished, but I believe that listing these few is sufficient for now.

So, the specific goals of the demiurge's efforts were as follows: lowering barriers between different historically-lived types of religiosity; strengthening in people's souls ideas and feelings directed towards the fight against tyranny, overcoming global fragmentation, and uniting everyone; deepening the sense of social compassion, thirst for social justice, and awareness of universal social rights; revealing in people the potential of reason and judgment that will contribute to rapid progress in science and technology; exposing the aggressive and vampiric nature of the state; removing in the consciousness of many people the antagonism between spiritual-ascetic and "pagan" tendencies and developing a synthetic relationship with nature; activating the manifestations of the Eternal Feminine principle in historical activity, the expression of which in Russia, Navna, weakened and tormented, was in captivity for many centuries.

Listing these objects of demiurgic involution is sufficient to clarify the final unsuitability of the Russian Orthodox Church for this purpose. But it was precisely towards all these ideas that the involution of the demiurge and Navna was directed in the great artistic geniuses and deepest talents of Russia, whom we call messengers. Of course, the psychological picture was complicated by many purely human factors: cultural, social, individual-biographical, and sometimes even the influence of the mighty radiation from the great spiritual repository of previous centuries: Orthodoxy. Sometimes inspirations from demonic worlds invaded, especially from two: Drukkarga and Duggur.

If I were to devote a description of the missions and fates of each of the Russian heralds, even limiting myself to the boundaries of artistic language and at least one chapter, a separate work containing more than twenty chapters would be obtained. Therefore, I am forced to make do with a minimal number of characteristics, which are undeveloped and completely aphoristic, and my judgments about these figures will inevitably take the form of statements that are almost devoid of argumentation. I am compelled to pass over, without stopping, the epochs of Lomonosov, Derzhavin, and Karamzin, and to begin the group of meta-historical characteristics with that whose name has long been associated with the beginning of the golden age of our literature.

About Pushkin, as everyone knows, there exist mountains of research and thousands of opinions have been expressed. But I will be allowed to add to these characteristics one more, made from a perspective that has not yet been considered: from the perspective of meta-history. From this perspective, Pushkin's mission consists in creating a capacious, flexible, rich, and extremely expressive literary language and magnificent verse, thus giving a decisive impetus to the process of developing a nationwide love for language, words, verse, and the very culture of language as the foundation of human communication. He armed those who followed him in time with this perfect means for expressing any ideas and feelings, developed a series of necessary new genres for this purpose, and himself headed the process of artistic expression of these ideas and images.

But what are these ideas and which exact images are they?

Firstly, these are ideas related to the task of exposing the demonic nature of the state and strengthening the complex of liberating-moral aspirations of individual souls and the entire nation. This includes the idea of the unforgivability of a crime committed by supreme power, that is, the awareness of the inadequacy of power that is based on the violation of ethical norms (as in "Freedom" and especially "Boris Godunov"). This also includes the idea of the insolubility, both in the rational-logical plan and in the plan of humanistic conscience, of contradictions between the individual and the state, between the individual and the demonized laws of the world (as in "The Bronze Horseman"). This is also related to the idea of the opposition between the lower, self-sufficient freedom of the individual and the social harmony ("The Gypsies"). These ideas, influencing the consciousness of many people who have been exposed to literature, ultimately prepared them for the idea that ethics should take precedence over the state, that is, for the desirability - although utopian for the present time - of establishing a highly ethical controlling and guiding principle over an amoral state.

The second cycle of ideas was related to the task of changing the relationship of Christian humanity to Nature. Essentially, it was the idea of experiencing Nature as an objectively beautiful principle, by no means condemned or hostile, although possessing a side that often forces one to perceive Nature as indifferent and unconcerned towards humanity. At the same time, however, the feeling of its indifference did not prevent the experience of Nature as a subjectively beloved principle. These experiences, expressed in a large number of excellent form poems and individual passages in poems, prepared the consciousness for the conclusion that some kind of - still vaguely dreamed of - new type of relationship and communication with Nature was possible: joyful, emotional, friendly, and at the same time, by no means sinful.

This was intertwined with a new perception of the process of life in its everyday form: in the discovery of elements of poetry and beauty and in their enlightenment of the lower, mundane layers of human life. All of this, like the previous ideas, went against the precepts of the ascetic period and paved the way for understanding the distant future tasks of the Rose of the World - the task of permeating spirituality and the religious-poetic element into all aspects of life.

The third cycle of ideas was associated with the task of uncovering a new, deeper meaning of human religious aspirations towards the Eternal Feminine, and in this, it seems to me, the influence of not only Navna but also Zventy-Sventana was felt.

This passage relates to the idea of Eternal Femininity as a transcendent cosmic principle, the expression of which is unthinkable and impossible in any specific human plurality or individual woman ("The Poor Knight"); and the antinomic idea of Eternal Femininity as an inherent human principle, which is attained – not embodied, of course, but remotely reflected – in passing among us in the beautiful female soul ("Eugene Onegin"). One can see the first, weakly perceived reflections of Navna in "Poor Liza" by Karamzin; all images of femininely beautiful, even all timid attempts to fix it in art, contain reflections of one or another of the Great Sisters. For until the descent to Shadanakar from the cosmic heights of Zventy-Sventana, that is, until the 19th century, it was the dwelling in Shadanakar of the ideal Cathedral Souls of superpeoples that made it possible for the forces of Femininity to penetrate into the human self. But in the chain of female images in our literature, surrounded by the finest fragrance of Navna, Tatiana Larina is the first image whose beauty and harmony affect descendants with the same power a century later as it did at the time of its emergence.

Furthermore, Pushkin for the first time raised the specifically Russian, and in the future, global question of the artist as a messenger of the highest reality and of the ideal image of the prophet as the final imperative of the messenger. Of course, he himself could not clearly realize that his intuition breaks this circle of what is specifically achievable in the 19th century and breaks through to that coming epoch when the Rose of the World will begin to acquire its flesh in the historical layer.

And finally, in a number of his works ("The Captain's Daughter", "Tales of Belkin", "The Queen of Spades", "A Feast in Time of Plague", "Mozart and Salieri" and many others), Pushkin addressed a number of more specific psychological, moral, and cultural issues, picked up and developed by his successors. Of course, the ideas expressed on these pages do not in any way claim to form an exhaustive meta-historical characterization of Pushkin. This is only the first attempt in this direction, and I have no doubt that the work of subsequent generations in revealing the meta-historical significance of Pushkin will completely overshadow this poor draft.

### Chapter 2. Missions and Destinies

It has already been noted by many researchers that Pushkin's harmony is an illusory phenomenon, and that in reality he was a personality full of contradictions and following a complex and radiant path of development, although the direction of this path undoubtedly lay towards greater harmonization. This is certainly true. But it is no less important that, despite this contradictory nature, in spite of the facts, Pushkin was and remains in the minds of millions of people a bearer of precisely the harmonious fusion of poetry and life.

And this illusion also has its positive meaning (like thousands of other illusions in the history of culture): this sunny god of our Parnassus, passing by, sometimes laughing, sometimes contemplating, sometimes playing, sometimes grieving, sometimes praying, at the very sources of Russian poetry, by this very means brings together in the consciousness of many the elements of poetry and life, destroys the barrier that separates human everyday life, the lives of ordinary people, from the sphere of poetic sounds, solemn, celestial, and incorporeal.

Each line of Pushkin evokes for us Russians so many cultural and historical associations that are precious and sacred to us, that we easily succumb even to the temptation to exaggerate its significance, to see global scales where in reality there exist only the scales of national genius and messenger. From personal conversations and meetings with foreigners, I have come to a completely firm conviction, which had already been forming in me earlier under the influence of reviews of Pushkin abroad: foreigners, being deprived of associations that are inherent to us and perceiving Pushkin's texts in their, so to say, bare form, cannot understand why Pushkin's name is surrounded in Russia with almost cult-like veneration. It is possible that if high-quality translations of his works had appeared in European languages during his lifetime, they would have met with a more enthusiastic response. But the translations were late, and now there is no longer any hope that the stock of ideas and images laid down in Pushkin's poetry, or especially his lyric melodies, will ever truly stir the cultural environment of other peoples. It is characteristic that foreigners of any nationality with whom I have had conversations, whether German or Japanese, Pole or Arab, become infected with the emotional resonance and recognize the presence of global scales not in Pushkin, but in Lermontov.

But although, as it seems to me, Dostoevsky somewhat exaggerated the international side of Pushkin's creativity in his famous speech at the unveiling of the monument to Pushkin in Moscow, nevertheless he and Zhukovsky were the first poets in Russia to expand poetic themes to universal boundaries not in the conventional, false classical plan as Knyazhnin or Ozerov did, but in the plan of real, deeply intuitive, genuine penetration into the spirit of other nations and cultures. Naturally, this cultural-historical fact found its place precisely in the first half of the 19th century, when among the primary tasks facing the enveloping forces of the Demiurge, the task of cultural overcoming of the boundaries between peoples, the task of bringing the Russian people closer to them, the task of developing the abilities of psychological and ideological penetration into the essence of other cultures, clearly defined. 

Talks about the fact that Pushkin had supposedly passed the zenith of his creativity by the age of 37 and that if he had remained alive, nothing more could be expected from him than works on history and culture and several secondary artistic works, are not based on anything and have no value. None - except perhaps that they reveal the surface of psychological analysis from the side of judges who cannot distinguish the inevitable periods of creative stagnation and accumulation in the life of any artist from the phase of final depletion of creative impulse.

The national tragedy that swept Russia upon learning of the poet's death showed that a mission of national importance had been entrusted for the first time in history not to a lineager, hero, or a great achiever, but to an artistic genius. Even if people did not realize it, they felt it distinctly. The murder of a genius was understood by everyone as the greatest of evils, and the perpetrator was cast out of Russia like slag. Helpless anger and indignation can now be felt while reading about the prosperity and success that fate bestowed upon Dantes - the fate of a self-satisfied rich man and a senator of the Second Empire who did not even feel a shadow of regret for his heinous crime.

But for meta-historical contemplation, it is too clear how fleeting this past triumph was and how terrible the posthumous fate of Dantes was. Now, after his second dark mission and his secondary fall to the bottom of Shadankar, he is threatened with becoming the bearer of the dark mission for the third time and then being cast out of our brafmatura.

If Pushkin's death was a great misfortune for Russia, then Lermontov's death was a real catastrophe, and the creative womb not only of Russian culture but also of other metacultures could not help but tremble from this blow. Pushkin's mission, though difficult and only partly, still fits into human notions; in essence, it is clear. Lermontov's mission is one of the deepest mysteries of our culture.

From a very early age, there was an unwavering sense of one's own chosenness, some exceptional duty that loomed over fate and soul; phenomenally early development of a raging, fiery imagination and a powerful, cold mind; a supra-national psychic structure amidst the fundamentally Russian elemental emotions; a penetrating, sharp gaze that pierces through the human soul; a deep religiosity of nature that even switches doubt from the realm of philosophical judgments to that of godless rebellion - the legacy of the ancient incarnations of this monad in the titans of humanity; the highest degree of artistic talent with the strictest demands on oneself, compelling the selection of only masterpieces among masterpieces for publication... All of this, combined in Lermontov, strengthens our confidence that the storm near Pyatigorsk that drowned out Martynov's shot was raging not only in Enrof at that hour. This mission, which was interrupted by the common Enemy, was to create something that would eventually surpass the size and significance of the conjectures of our minds - something truly titanic.

Of the great contemplators of "both abysses" - the abysses of the upper world and the abysses of demonic layers - I still know only three in our culture: Ivan the Terrible, Lermontov, and Dostoevsky. The fourth should be named Alexander Blok, if it were not for the lesser, relative to these three, scale of his personality.

If we do not lift the veil on the secret mission that Lermontov did not accomplish, we can at least guess its direction with the help of meta-historical contemplation and reflection on the polarity of his soul. Such contemplation leads to the following conclusion: two opposing tendencies are discernible in Lermontov's personality and creative work without much effort. The first is the line of atheism, which is already evident in his childhood poems and appears to superficial observers as a variation of fashionable Byronism.

If Byronism is the opposition of a free, proud personality to a human society bound by chains of conventionality and mediocrity, then certainly there is Byronism here. But this is only the surface; the deep underlying layers of these manifestations in the creative paths of both poets are very different. Byron's rebellion is primarily against society. The images of Lucifer, Cain, and Manfred are merely literary techniques, artistic masks. Byron, the bearer of genius poetic talent, had a modest scale as a human being; he had no past embodiment as a titan in humanity. To a true titan, the dream of the crown of Greece would seem like a pitiful and petty child's play, and the demonic poses that Byron loved to strike would only evoke a smile from him if he had not seen in them real influences of demonic forces. And there were such influences, and they were very persistent. The burning desire for fame and power, the constant masquerade of life, the baseness of Italian adventures - all this points not to the titanic nature of this person, but only to his vulnerability to demonic envelopment. And since his overall talent was enormous, and the background against which he acted - the society of that time - was completely dull, this masquerade could mislead not only Countess Guiccioli, but also a true titan, such as Goethe. Byron is amicable. His creativity was essentially nothing but an English version of that cultural phenomenon which took shape on the continent in the ideological revolution of the Encyclopedists: a revolution of skeptical consciousness against, as Spengler would say, "the great forms of antiquity." In Lermontov's case, his rebellion against society is not primary, but derivative: this rebellion is not as consistent, stubborn, and deep as Byron's, it does not lead the poet to voluntary exile or to the centers of liberation movements. But Lermontov's Demon, on the other hand, is not a literary technique, not a means of shocking the aristocracy or the bourgeoisie, but an attempt to artistically express a certain profound experience of the soul, acquired by it from pre-existence through encounters with such a formidable and powerful hierarchy that the trace of these encounters emerged from the layers of the poet's deep memory onto the surface of his consciousness throughout his life. In contrast to Byron, Lermontov is essentially a mystic. Not a mystic-decadent of a late, exhausted culture, whose mysticism is predetermined by the era, fashion, socio-political existence, but a mystic, if one can put it that way, by the grace of God; a mystic because his inner organs - spiritual vision, hearing, and deep memory, as well as the gift of contemplation of cosmic panoramas and the gift of understanding human souls - were partially opened from birth, and through them a second reality seeps into the sphere of consciousness: reality, not fantasy. This was excellently demonstrated in the analysis of Lermontov's texts by Merezhkovsky - the only critic and thinker who did not glide over the surface in his judgments of Lermontov, but touched upon the transphysical root of things (D.S. Merezhkovsky. Lermontov).

Lermontov experienced dissatisfaction with his poem about the Demon throughout his life. As he matured, he couldn't help but see how much personal, epochal, human, and autobiographical material had woven into the fabric of the poem, lowering its transphysical level, clouding and thinning the image, anthropomorphizing the plot. Obviously, if it weren't for his death, he would have returned to these texts many times and eventually created a work in which perhaps only a few dozen stanzas remained from the poem we know. But the thing is, Lermontov was not only a great mystic; he was a person who lived life to the fullest and had a huge mind - one of the greatest in the 19th century in Russia. Therefore, his tendency towards atheism manifested not only in the layer of mystical experience of deep memory but also in the layer of purely intellectual and in the layer of everyday practical manifestations, in life. This is how many facts of his external biography should be understood: his revelry and debauchery, his youth vice - not Pushkin's cheerful, but gloomy and heavy, his behavior with those women before whom he presented himself as either Pechorin or almost the Demon, and perhaps even his military prowess. (By the age of twenty-five, all these fluctuations of Lermontov's life had come to an end, lost any interest for him, and were worn out, while Byron continued to be a playground for all kinds of forces until the end of his thirty-five-year life.) In the intellectual plane, this rebellious tendency took the form of cold and bitter skepticism, the form of mournful, corrosively pessimistic reflections of the reader of human souls. This is how this tendency manifested itself in "A Hero of Our Time," "Sashka," "A Fairy Tale for Children," and so on.

But alongside this tendency in the depths of his poetry, from his earliest years to his last, there flows quietly and gurglingly, sometimes rising to incomparably wonderful sounds, a second stream: a bright, heartfelt, warm faith. One had to lose all ability to understand spiritual reality to the extent that Russian critics of the last century did in order not to understand the black-and-white, loudly proclaiming testimonies to this reality in Lermontov's verses. One had to petrify one's thoughts not to realize that the Angel who brought his soul to earth and sang the song that "the dull songs of the earth could not replace" was not a literary device, as it was with Byron, but a fact. One would like to know: in what other poetic image should one expect from a genius and a messenger testimonies about the daimon that has long accompanied him, if not in this one? - One must be completely devoid of religious hearing not to feel the full authenticity and depth of his experiences that gave rise to the lyrical akathist "I, the Mother of God, now with prayer..." not to grasp the musical-poetic fact that the most perfect in their unprecedented poetic musicality stanzas of Lermontov speak precisely about the second reality shining through the visible to all: "The Branch of Palestine", "The Mermaid", amazing stanzas about the East in "The Dispute", "When the yellowing field is stirred... ", "On the airy ocean... ", "In the noonday heat in the Dagestan valley... ", "Three Palms", the pictures of nature in "Mtsyri", in "The Demon", and much more.

Obviously, in the direction of even greater, ultimate polarization of these two tendencies, in their deadly struggle, in the victory of the asserting principle and in the attainment of the highest wisdom and enlightenment of the creative spirit lay the unfulfilled mission of Lermontov. But the fact is that Lermontov was not "an artistic genius in general" and not just a herald—he was a Russian artistic genius and a Russian herald, and as such he could not be satisfied with the formula "the words of the poet are his business". Lermontov's entire life was, in essence, a painful search for what to apply his tearing strength to. The university, of course, turned out to be too small. The bohemian life of professional writers of that time was hopelessly petty. One cannot imagine Lermontov being confined to family circles, in personal comfort, I think, even the most well-intentioned fantasy cannot do so. The military epic of the Caucasus fascinated him with its romantic side, enriched him with a mass of impressions, but after "Valerik," there is no doubt that even military activity was realized by him as something fundamentally foreign to what he had to accomplish in life. But what then? What heroic feat could a person of such magnitude, such a range of ideas, find for himself if his life had lasted another forty or fifty years? It is as impossible to imagine Lermontov joining the revolutionary movement of the 1860s and 1870s as it is to picture Tolstoy participating in a terrorist organization in his old age, or Dostoevsky joining a social-democratic party. "Poetic seclusion in Tarkhany? But is that what his heroic strength demanded? Monastery, hermitage? Certainly: the burden of seclusion would have been suited to this spiritual athlete, his strength could have found a point of application on this path. But Orthodox monasticism is incompatible with the artistic creativity of the type and forms it has acquired in our later times, and it seems that Lermontov would never have given up this creativity. It is possible that this titan would never have resolved the task set for him: to merge artistic creativity with spiritual action and the heroic struggle of life, to transform from a messenger into a prophet. But personally, I find it more likely that if the catastrophe of Pyatigorsk had not erupted, Russian society would have witnessed a life path for Lermontov the old man that is unimaginable for us and unique for anyone else. It would have led him to the heights where ethics, religion, and art merge into one, where all the wanderings and falls of the past have been overcome, understood, and served to enrich the spirit, and where wisdom, foresight, and enlightened greatness are such that all of humanity gazes up at these lords of mountain peaks of culture with reverence, love, and trembling joy.

In which creations of artistic language would this life and spiritual experience find its expression? As is known, Lermontov planned a trilogy, the first part of which was to take place during the Pugachev rebellion, the second during the Decembrist era, and the third in the 1840s. But he would likely have completed this trilogy by the age of forty. What then? Perhaps a cycle of "novels of ideas" would have emerged? Or an epic mystery like "Faust"? Or maybe a new, unseen genre would have emerged? In any case, in the 70s and 80s of the last century, Europe would have become a spectator of this unprecedented creation, rising to it from the mysterious womb of Russia and anticipating the times when a flower of universal brotherhood - the Rose of the World, nurtured by messengers, geniuses, righteous men, and prophets - will bloom from this womb.

The death of Lermontov did not, of course, evoke any response in historical Europe. But when the shot rang out at the foot of Mashuk, the creative heart of not only Russia but also Western metacultures could not but tremble, just as, presumably, the demiurge Yarosvet himself would have wept if the life of Wolfgang Goethe had been cut short at the age of twenty-seven on the banks of the Rhine.

A significant part of the responsibility for his own death falls on Lermontov himself. I do not know through which purgatories the great spirit passed in the afterlife, untying the knots of his karma. But I know that now he is one of the brightest stars in the Synclite of Russia, that he invisibly passes through and beyond us, creating over us and within us, and the scope and magnitude of this creativity are unimaginable in any of our expectations.

There, another luminary creates: the one who was our dear, native Gogol a hundred years ago.

The task that Pushkin foresaw, which Lermontov would likely have resolved by the end of his life, stood before Gogol with exceptional urgency.

No conscious movement forward is possible without realizing the imperfection of the stage on which you find yourself and without understanding its imperfection.

To make Russia aware of its imperfections, the imperfections of its stage of development, the ugliness of its unenlightened life -- this was what Gogol had to do and did. He was given a terrible gift -- the gift of contemplating the underside of life, and another: artistic genius to embody what he saw in objectively existing creations, showing it to everyone. But Gogol's tragedy stemmed from the fact that he felt within himself a third gift, unrevealed and painfully demanding revelation -- and he did not know -- and did not learn -- how to reveal this third gift: the gift of proclaiming the worlds of the ascending series, the gift of preaching and teaching. At the same time, he could not realize the difference between prophecy and prophesying; it seemed to him that the heralding of the worlds of Light through the images of art must necessarily be connected with the height of ethical life, with personal righteousness. His mind's abilities, limited compared to his artistic genius, did not allow him to understand the mismatch between his task and the forms of Orthodox teaching activity, into which he tried to clothe it. His psyche, shaken and ulcerated by the contemplation of monsters "with mournful faces," could not withstand the collision between Orthodox asceticism and the demands of artistic creativity, between the feeling of prophetic vocation and the awareness of his unworthiness, between the visions of the infernal circles that had tormented him and the burning thirst to proclaim and teach about the worlds above. And his lack of power - compared to Lermontov - in the sphere of active will, as it were, drove this vital conflict into the inner space of the soul, deprived it of the necessary revelations outwardly and gave a touch of mystery to the last decisive period of his life.

"Gogol posted... ", "Gogol prayed... ", "Gogol lost himself in mysticism... " How pathetic they are, these banalities that haven't left the pages of our print for a hundred years. Repin's painting "The Self-immolation of Gogol" is well-known. In the end, every viewer brings something of their own into the work of art, and it's impossible to prove that they see something in the painting that others don't. Among professional painters, this painting by Repin sometimes elicits more skeptical or even indignant responses. Some believe that it represents an illegal intrusion of "literature" into painting. You may even hear more severe assessments, which perceive in it a substitution of Gogol's spiritual tragedy with some purely physiological collision. I don't see any of this. I see something entirely different. I see that not a single person who has expressed their judgment on Gogol's tragedy, even such a profound analyst as Merezhkovsky, was as insightful and profound as Repin, who was usually not deep at all.

When you, free from professional prejudices, look at this painting, you feel yourself involuntarily drawn into a spiritual abyss through successive psycho-physical layers.

At first, you see a sick person, semi-mad, maybe even completely insane, exhausted in the struggle with some, probably hallucinatory, vision. At the same time, you experience a mixture of sympathy and that unconscious, involuntary repulsion that is typical of "mentally normal" people when they come into contact with the mentally ill. But then this layer peels off like chaff; suddenly you discern the distorted face of a human being, tormented by the throes of death, who has sacrificed and is sacrificing everything that is most precious to them, everything they have lived for: their most cherished thoughts, their most beloved creations, their most secret dreams - the entire meaning of life. In the fading eyes, in the contorted mouth - horror and despair of true self-immolation. The horror is transmitted to the viewer, mixed with pity, and it seems that the heart cannot withstand such an intensity of feelings. And then the third layer becomes visible - I don't know if it is the last. The same fading eyes, the same lips, clenched in either a spasm or a wild, desperate smile, begin to shine with childlike, pure, unwavering faith and the love with which a weeping child clings to its mother's knees. "I have given everything to You - accept me, beloved Lord! Comfort me, embrace me!" - the dying person's eyes say.

And the miracle of the artist is that the answer is already contained in the very plea of these eyes - as if they already see the Great Intercessor embracing and receiving this suffering soul into the lap of love.

He who passes through all these layers of the amazing Repin creation will not doubt in another, the highest, comforting and justifying: that the gates of Synclite opened wide before Gogol, like before his favorite son. 

These first three great geniuses of Russian literature raised and established this literature to the height of the spiritual leader of society, the teacher of life, the indicator of ideals and the messenger of the worlds of spiritual light, earned it fame and national authority, crowned with the halo of martyrdom.

### Chapter 3. Missions and Destinies (Continued)

In the chapter about the middle worlds of Shadanakar, as far as I can shed light on it, I mentioned the nature of the connection between humanity and the Sakwala Daimons. I also mentioned the race of Metaproimages, who live alongside the Daimons and are of great importance in understanding some works of Enrofian art.

Leo Tolstoy was the father of Andrei Bolkonsky, although of course not in the sense in which he was the father of Sergey Lvovich or Tatyana Lvovna. The intuition of the genius artist, who synthetically created the image of Andrei from separate psychic and physical traits of different people, caught through this amalgam, like through a peculiar etheric focus, a similar but even more significant image of a creature from Zherama - that layer in the Sakuala of Daimons which plays for them the same role as Enrof for us. It was a creature from the race of metaproimages - a race that lagged behind the Daimons in its development and was cared for by them. I have already mentioned that they are extremely similar to humans in both their outward appearance and their souls. The image of Andrei Bolkonsky was perceived and creatively empathized by millions of people who read Tolstoy's epic. The psychic radiation of this human multitude greatly intensified this objectively existing, etheric image of Andrei created by Tolstoy, and for the metaproimage associated with it, it became one of its material incarnations, something like its etheric body, something necessary for its further development, or rather facilitating and accelerating its development, as if filling its creature with new hot forces and fullness of life. I am not able to analyze this process more accurately. It is possible that in the next eon, when transformed humanity begins to save those who have fallen into the magma and the core of Shadanakar, the one known to us as Andrei Bolkonsky, now in Magirna, will find his incarnation in Enrof and participate in the great creative work together with all of us. And in the current eon, each of the metaproimages, who received ethereal clothing from the artists of Enrof, absorbs our psychic emanations, caused by us, into their composition, but also influences back on the multitude of specific human psyches: it either slows down their development or promotes it - depending on the nature that was communicated to it by its creator-artist. That is why the universal duty of fatherhood is lifted from great artists: by being lifted, it is replaced by the duty of fatherhood of another kind. Dante, Leonardo, Raphael, Michelangelo, Cervantes, Schiller, Mozart, Beethoven, Lermontov, Gogol, Chekhov, Glinka, Tchaikovsky, Mussorgsky, and dozens of other artistic geniuses and messengers had no children, but none of our moral instincts imputes this to them to their detriment precisely because we all unconsciously know that the duty of fatherhood was fulfilled by them, albeit not in the usual way.

It would be a crude simplification to assume that behind all the human images of literary and artistic works, there are metaproimages from the world of daimons. On the contrary, they stand only for a negligible minority from this vast gallery: usually for those we call types and for very large individualities. But in those cases when they stand, the meaning of the artist's creation of a human image is twofold. Firstly, through it a powerful impact is made on the human beings of our layer. Secondly, as I repeat, a subtle material envelope is created, imparting life forces to the metaproimage and shortening its path in the sakual of Daimons.

However, it is clear that the artist cannot be free from the karmic connection with the metaproimages he depicts and from the karmic responsibility for their fate, just as a human father is responsible for the fate of his born and raised children. Gogol spent enormous efforts and truly titanic work to help those whom he once named Sobakevich, Chichikov, or Plyushkin in their ascending path. Whether he foresaw this in his lifetime or not, it is well known that he already passionately dreamed and even tried to artistically anticipate the so-called conversion of the main characters of "Dead Souls", that is, their conscious entry onto the ascending path. The unfinished in life is accomplished by the artist in the afterlife and this time.

The more significant the human-like image created by the artist, the greater possibilities it opens up for the metaproimage. And the one who was portrayed by Goethe as Faust will soon enter the Synclite of the World, where Don Quixote has long been residing, and in the second zone, he will become a grand personality among the transformed humanity.

For a person with developed spiritual hearing and vision, meeting with someone who is known and loved by us as Andrei Bolkonsky is just as achievable and absolutely real as meeting with the great human spirit that was Leo Tolstoy. The question lies in the development of the corresponding organs of perception that are inherent in each of us and in which particular one we have penetrated into the immaterial layers of Shadanakar thanks to these organs.

No matter how fantastic everything I say here may seem and how much mockery the confident tone of these statements may provoke, I am ready to face any ridicule, but I cannot retract any of the formulated thoughts here.

However, after what has been said, the following cannot seem strange: the role of the winged daimon in relation to a human - a bearer of a gift and a mission - lies, in terms of its method of influence, in that it first and foremost removes the barriers from the storage of the creative impulse inherent in the messenger, as well as in every person, thereby contributing to the fact that a stream of fertilizing impressions of life is directed towards the creative womb of the artist, taking shape in one or another form; in many cases - in a human form. Further work of the daimon on the messenger's astral body aims to weaken the rigidity of the etheric-physical barriers that separate human consciousness from higher abilities inherent in the astral body. Depending on the artistic and personal individuality of a given artist, as well as on the nature of their mission, the work of the daimon may be particularly focused on one of these abilities: on spiritual vision or hearing, on deep memory, on the ability to contemplate cosmic panoramas and perspectives, on the ability of higher understanding of other human souls - this ability can be called spiritual analysis - and finally, on the ability to Love in the highest sense of the word. In some cases, the work of the daimon may be directed solely towards the disclosure of one of these abilities, and its disclosure will facilitate and accelerate its work on other abilities in another, later period of the messenger's life on earth. Something similar happened, for example, with Chekhov. His mission was to permeate the art of words with love for people to the extent to which only Dickens and Dostoevsky approached. Chekhov was on a completely straight path. His spiritual vision, hearing, and ability to contemplate cosmic panoramas were all temporarily closed off, caused by the fact that the work of the daimon was focused on revealing within him the gift of higher love. When this phase of work was completed, the other abilities would have opened up one after the other with astonishing speed. By the age of seventy, Chekhov would have been an example of the combination of genius and holiness. Only his death at the age of forty-four prevented this.

There is a certain law of scales: the becoming monad becomes greater the deeper the descents it has made and the sufferings it has endured. The monad emanates from the bosom of the Father into matter not to glide on the surface of one of the layers of planetary space, but to traverse it all, to know it all, to transform it all, and, rising from greatness to greatness, to become the driver of the stars, the creator of galaxies, and finally, the co-creator with the Father of new monads and universes.

Hence our feeling of awe and reverence not only before the categories of the beautiful and the sublime, but also before the category of the great. Hence the emergence in our souls of this feeling upon encountering such images as Oedipus, Prometheus, Faust, Don Juan, and Brandt. And it is precisely the grandiose scale of the potentials laid in them that distinguishes the "children of Dostoevsky."

What, essentially, justifies the endless, endlessly varied "infernal" descents of these heroes from novel to novel, from character to character? What positive value can our wanderings in their wake through the labyrinths of these passions, these murders and suicides, these physical and spiritual plants, through the darkest streams of the soul's world bring? Are not such wanderings fraught with danger, on the contrary, of succumbing to temptation, of imitating and committing equally unforgivable, even criminal, actions?

Those who love Dostoevsky often refer to the fact that the great writer teaches to distinguish the "spark of God" in the most fallen soul, which inspires compassion for the unhappy, and so on. Compassion he does inspire, and it is great. But always? Will compassion be the main component in our attitude towards Stavrogin, Peter Verkhovensky, or Svidrigailov? And the discovery of the "spark of God" in Verkhovensky or Smerdyakov serves as a poor consolation; it does not justify or mitigate their criminal actions. The point is different: that to some extent it is not that it justifies, but it makes us believe in the high potential of their potentials, irrationally felt by us, the scale of their experiences. Of course, this does not mean that they are not responsible for what they have done, but that we (at least the reader who possesses a meta-historical worldview) are confident that the deeper these possessed by the temptation of the soul went, the lower the circles they passed through, the higher their rise will be, the more grandiose their experience, the wider the scope of their future personality, and the greater their distant and predestined fate. 

As an ethical artist who awakens our compassion towards the unhappy and fallen, Dostoevsky is great - so great that this alone would be enough to firmly establish him as one of the top figures in the pantheon of world literature forever. Perhaps no less great is he as an artist-messenger of the Eternal Feminine; only the search for the direction of this principle should not be in the muddied, mentally crippled, internally lost, lowered by their own hysterical image of Nastasya Filippovna or Katerina Ivanovna, but in the version of a universal theme developed in the West in the person of Margaret and Solveig, which was created by Dostoevsky himself. The story of Sonya Marmeladova and Raskolnikov is a stunning testimony to how the Eternal Feminine draws us onward.

But even greater is Dostoevsky precisely because he leads us, like Vergil led Dante, through the darkest, most secret, and most unilluminated twists and turns, leaving no corner unenlightened and no demon hiding or concealed. This was the main feature of his mission: to enlighten the darkest and most terrifying layers of the psyche with spiritual analysis. In this respect, he is not only a great writer, but perhaps the most profound of all time. Beyond this lay another task: the penetration of these layers with the same analysis in the brighter layers, but on this road he barely managed to take the first steps.

In any case, if for the ultimate purposes of the Demiurge, which I spoke of in the previous chapter, it is necessary to expand the boundaries of the personality to the utmost and include in the zone it encompasses the most extreme layers of infraphysics (for as long as they remain unexplored, they cannot be enlightened), then no one has done as much for this as Dostoevsky.

I mentioned Dante not by chance. But in order to understand this connection correctly, it is necessary to clearly understand the different plans, forms, and stages of such a descent into infraphysical layers.

The work of the daimon on Dostoevsky focused mainly on the development of his ability to understand the souls of other humans at the highest level; his other spiritual faculties remained only partially open. Therefore, his works contain not direct, open images of immaterial realities, as in Dante, but their functions in the layer of human psyche, human actions, and judgments. A person who retained a more vivid memory of such descents would be able to distinguish the functions of such descending layers in the psyche and actions of many of Dostoevsky's heroes. He would discover the functions of Duggur, Shim-big, and Dn in the souls of Stavrogin and Svidrigailov; Drukkarga and Gashsharva in the soul of Peter Verkhovensky, the function of Gashsharva and Tsebrumra - a layer of the future anti-church of the antichrist - in the Grand Inquisitor. In the personality of Ivan Karamazov, the functions of many different worlds of both the ascending and descending series would be discovered. The chapter "The Wedding at Cana" is an explicit reminiscence of Heavenly Russia, perhaps even a reflection of the Blue Pyramid - the Transmyth of Christianity - and in general, in the psyche of Myshkin, Alyosha Karamazov, especially the elder Zosima, traces of semi-forgotten wanderings through very high layers can be felt. The image and even the words of Kromonozhka contain a memory of the great elementals - Mother Earth.

The gallery of human images created by Dostoevsky has no equal, not only in Russian literature but in any literature. It is no wonder that no other Russian writer, except Tolstoy, enjoys such unshakable worldwide fame. It is well known that the philosophical, religious, moral, psychological, socio-historical, cultural ideas put forth by Dostoevsky are truly countless. I will limit myself to pointing out only two of them, which have a completely special significance from a meta-historical point of view.

The first is the interpretation of the revolutionary movement of that time for which Dostoevsky later received the title of "prophet of the Russian revolution." In "The Possessed," one can find a mass of details accurately noted by Dostoevsky about the Narodnaya Volya, which did not pass on to their historical successors. It is precisely for this reason that the latter deny their relationship with the characters of the famous novel and consider it a slander on the revolution altogether. But if one can rid oneself of this blindness caused by vivid details, a certain substance common to both Verkhovensky and his companions as well as their historical descendants will be revealed - a certain "root of things." Both desired the destruction of the existing order in order to "build for themselves." Both went about this by shaking the foundations of society and, finally, armed revolution. Both were not only merciless and devoid of any hint of pity, gratitude, or indulgence but also hated everything that hindered them with a burning, vengeful, and unstoppable hatred. Some anticipated, while others implemented the need to spread the legend of "Ivan the Prince," a miraculous leader. Some dreamed, while others carried out "an all-encompassing convulsion every few years," carrying away countless victims. Some dreamed, while others carried out the education of new generations who imagined themselves to be free and soulless. Both are two consecutive stages in the development of the same tendency, despite the fact that the metahistorical forces behind each of these stages, as I will try to show subsequently, were not identical but closely related.

Another idea of Dostoevsky's is just as directly related to the ultimate goals of the demiurge and to our common human future. This idea is presented in the well-known dialogue between Ivan Karamazov and the monks in the monastery ("Wake up, wake up!"). The idea is that in the historical future, something opposite to the Roman Catholic idea of transforming the church into the state (as Dostoevsky understood it) will be realized: the transformation of the state into the church. Seventy-five years ago, such an idea seemed like a utopian anachronism to someone, twenty-five years ago - the ravings of a mystic detached from life; now it makes one think; in ten or twenty years, it will begin its triumphant march through humanity. Naturally, Dostoevsky did not entrust this task to the Rose of the World, which even he could not foresee in the 19th century, but to Orthodoxy.

The providential nature of Dostoevsky's destiny is also evident. Of course, suffering is always suffering, and the heart can be filled with compassion when we read about the infinite torments and sufferings that made up the external side of his life. But however terrible these events may be from a humanistic point of view, they were absolutely necessary to make the man and artist the giant that he became. These include his epilepsy, the anomalous shape of his sexual sphere, the unbridledness and passion of his nature, his moments on the scaffold, his time in exile, and even his poverty.

But for some reason, literature almost never mentions the fact of his exceptional importance: namely, that in the last years of his life, Dostoevsky freed himself, one after another, from passions that demanded overcoming and outliving; for him, a time of purification had come. His great heart, which had embraced so many human tragedies and shed blood for the fate of so many children of artistic genius, was becoming transparent from the turbidity, and at the same time, the forces of love were growing. And when you read some pages of "The Brothers Karamazov," for example, the chapter about Captain Snegiryov or some paragraphs about Dmitry, you are filled with the categorical feeling: to love like this, to embrace with compassion like this, and to forgive like this, one must already stand on the border of righteousness.

Of course, in his posthumous life, Dostoevsky received such opportunities for the salvation and upliftment of his metaproimages that we cannot know. And partly, this was the essence of his posthumous creativity, at least in a certain period. Soon another work began: to be the Vergil of sleeping infra-physicists.

But if we are still able to imagine this, his further creative stages lead to such heights and acquire such a scale that we can perceive them only when we ourselves enter the zatomis of our metaculture through spiritual vision - in life or with our entire composition after death.

Speaking about the prerequisites without which the birth of the Rose of the World is inconceivable historically and psychologically, I noted as one of the most important the removal of the primordial contradiction between two principles: ascetic-spiritual and the so-called "pagan". The ascetic principle, as self-sufficient, was justified by the meta-historical dialectic at the early stages of many meta-cultures; in Christian meta-cultures, as has already been said more than once, it was associated with the incompleteness and interruptedness of Christ's mission. And one has to get stuck precisely at this stage in order to continue to seriously think that the goal of world development is exhausted by the salvation of several hundred thousand righteous people. Such a thought was possible with the worldview of the first centuries of Christianity; historical Christianity was formed based on the data of precisely such a worldview; other religions that formed one and a half, two, or two and a half thousand years ago did not differ in greater breadth, and could not differ. The only partially successful attempt to change the ossified dogma a little was the Reformation. But the Renaissance and the Reformation represent extremely complex meta-historical nodes. The transphysical monster that stood behind the Inquisition began to act long before the Inquisition appeared on the historical stage and its actions caused a split among the forces of light. Some of them sought to purify Christianity, but even among them, there was no unity: within this group, two directions were defined; the first one, which was extremely obscurely reflected in the Reformation, and the second, in the internal, albeit weak, desire of Catholicism to cleanse the church of the vile sins of the previous era. Another part of the forces of light deemed it necessary to temporarily depart from the historically established forms of Christianity altogether, hoping that the paths of development of secular, civic humanity in Europe would gradually come to a new understanding of the ideals of Christ. Thus, the Reformation and the Renaissance were under the sign of two opposing forces: the just-described force of the forces of light, deprived of unity and common direction, and the force of the demonic. Naturally, as soon as external religious coercion weakened, streams from various dark worlds rushed into unprepared souls: Mudgabra, Yunukamna, Duggura. The influence of Kaross intensified. Urparp himself did not remain inactive. The widening gap between science and ethics was, of course, inspired by him in order to bring science to complete isolation from morality, religion, and spirituality. Special creatures, acting as dark daimons, tried to achieve this goal. They intervened and directed the activities of even people with completely pure intentions. Even Copernicus, Galileo, and Descartes were not free from their influence. A daimon stood behind Leonardo throughout his life, although by the end of his life, its influence was suppressed by the Light. They were, so to speak, part of the plan of demonic forces, and many prominent Renaissance artists, such as Titian, were among them. However, his elemental nature and extreme indistinctness of consciousness prevented Urparp from making him the kind of profaner and seducer he wanted. Even Raphael's creativity was not entirely pure. The "enrofization" of ideas about the higher worlds of Shadanakar - this definition sounds prosaic and flat, but both Raphael's creativity and the entire Renaissance are under the sign of precisely this process. Despite all the artistic achievements, it was a step back, albeit logical and inevitable, if one does not forget - never forget! - about the tragic consequences of the unfinished mission of Christ.

The leaders of Protestantism turned away from enriching the world with religious ideas, insights, and feelings, and instead made it poorer by rejecting mystical and magical elements and by weakening the role of the religious-aesthetic element. In the heat of the struggle with Rome, any hope of spiritual guidance from religious and moral authorities was rejected, even as a distant dream. The impoverishment of Protestantism could not be justified by partial justification of secular principles, because it was not linked to the limitation of the exceptional demands of ascetic spirituality, but to a complete rejection of these principles, and because even the secular principle itself was deprived of prospects for transformation and enlightenment. Luther distorted his duty and arrogated a mission to himself. He could have become the pope and been given the power to make purifying reforms. Instead, he did what he did: he was responsible for the fragmentation of the Western church and the spiritual emptiness of its split half. It is not surprising that he had to experience a posthumous decline and only rise to the Synclite of Germany in our time.

The further course of cultural-historical processes in the West has shown that Protestantism, in essence, turned out to be another stage of the overall movement that began in the early Renaissance and passed through humanism, so to speak, the "secularization" of life (forgive me for another clumsy word; I will try not to repeat it). Of course, the reformers themselves could not know and understand this, but such was the objective direction of their activity, subjectively interpreted by them quite differently. The Red Horseman of the Apocalypse was racing over Christian humanity - the same one at the end of whose path our generation lives. The next stage of this process after the Reformation was served by empirical philosophy in England, the development of sciences that emancipated themselves from religion and ethics; and then - the encyclopedists with their half-deistic, half-materialistic philosophy, which had already made only one, albeit pitiful and powerless attempt to become a cult under Robespierre. Then followed the stage of scientific materialism, and finally, in the 20th century, the end of the ladder was reached in the form of elevating one of the varieties of materialism to the rank of a state-mandated, universally compulsory doctrine and its dogmatization.

This happened not in the West, but in a country that had not gone through the stage of Protestantism and had barely touched philosophical deism. Instead, it directly borrowed ideas from a much later stage. However, the soil that made such borrowing historically possible for Russia was once again nothing other than the backwardness of historical Christianity (this time in its Orthodox variety) from the objective expansion of cultural horizons and the rapid shifts in psychology. Thus, the secular "pagan" element, which had been suppressed for many centuries, sought revenge. The new forms in which this cultural movement manifested itself in the 19th century can and should be considered as Western intellectual forms for genuinely Russian, or rather, Russianness content. These forms included: borrowed social doctrines from the West - Fourierism, socialism, anarchism; artistic and literary genres - novel, novella, tragedy, comedy; domestic genre in painting; symphony, sonata, opera, musical drama; criticism and journalism... Their common content turned out to be an energetically defending worldview that finally recognized its own rights, which affirmed life and transformed society. But the times had changed. And if pre-Russianness was by no means devoid of spirituality, this spirituality was associated with Navna and the worlds of elementals, rather than with the Transmyth of Christianity. The new stage in this movement was marked by the almost complete extinction of magical and mystical elements and the violent manifestation and growth of social reformist and revolutionary-political impulses. Thus, the underground currents broke through to the surface of culture, and in the first half of the 20th century, they flooded the country with all its churches and monasteries.

In relation to this process, the meta-historical dialectic consists of the following: one must understand the duality of the Russian movement within culture - the bright elementals, that is, the justification of some of its aspects, and the dark demonism of others; the progressiveness of this movement at one stage, and regressiveness at another (by regressiveness, of course, I mean phenomena that express a struggle against the Providential principle in humanity and in the cosmos).

Love for the world is not only justified, but essential; nothing is possible without it, except for self-centered aspirations towards individual self-preservation.

But there is love, and there is love.

Love for the world, that is, for the natural and cultural environment, as sources of benefit only for us and pleasure only for us, and moreover, such sources that must become completely our servant and slave - this is what should not be.

Love for the world as something beautiful but distorted, clouded, suffering, and destined to become even more beautiful, purer, and blissful through centuries and eons of our work on it - this is the love that is indispensable. This does not mean, of course, that the forces of nature cannot be used for human benefit; it only means that alongside such use, the opposite must also be carried out: the use of human forces for the benefit and spiritual benefit of nature.

Love for life can be viewed as either a sum of pleasures and benefits for us or as material that we forcibly and tyrannically transform into what we want. This impulse is subject to unconditional and complete overcoming within ourselves.

Love for life as a world stream created by God, hierarchies, and man, blessed in everything from constellations and suns to electrons and protons, except for the demonic, is beautiful not only in our layer but also in hundreds of other layers, and waiting for our participation in it in the name of love. This is what humanity needs in order to avoid absolute tyranny and spiritual self-immolation.

And this does not mean that sensual joy is inherently forbidden for humans. On the contrary, it means that such joy is justified if it does not increase the sum of suffering of other beings and is balanced within ourselves by a willingness to accept from life not only pleasure but also sorrow, work, and duty.

Such clarity of boundaries could not have been achieved in the past century. The mixing of these forms of love for the world and for life was still inevitable. But their strengthening, intensification, and rise were necessary, and this is connected with the mission of our second greatest artistic genius - Lev Tolstoy (if we consider Dostoevsky the first).

No matter how many other, more specific tasks Tolstoy may have accomplished in his literary work, no matter how great the human-like characters he created, no matter how many psychological, moral, and cultural questions he raised and tried to resolve, for the meta-historian the most important thing is that he delivered a powerful sermon of love for the world and life. Life - not in the dense, reduced, unenlightened sense in which it was understood, say, by Balzac or Zola, but life, through the forms and images of which shines the light of a certain indefinable and inexpressible, but undoubtedly highest Truth. In some cases, this Truth will shine through grandiose historical collisions, through wars of nations and fires in capitals, in others - through magnificent, full-blooded, passionate nature, in the third - through the individual searches of human souls, their love, their insatiable striving for good, their spiritual thirst and faith. This is the kind of sermon Tolstoy, as a genius and messenger, had to deliver - and he did, often contrary to the intentions of his overthinking, overly rational mind; a sermon not with tendentious tirades, but with artistic images, saturated to the limit with love for the world, life, and the higher Truth behind them, images that are stronger than any tirade and more compelling than any logic.

He loved and reveled in this love, taught to love everything: the blooming branch of the elderberry, splashed with rain, and the quivering nostrils of a hot horse; the song of the mowers walking along the road, the sounds of which make the earth tremble, and the strong calves of running boys; the homeless old age of Karl Ivanovich, and the idyllic life of the Levins and Rostovs; the spiritual thirst that led Pierre to the Masons, and Father Sergius into wandering, and the crunch of snow under Sonya's hurried steps, when her face, illuminated by the winter moon, approaches Nikolai's lips with all the purity of youth and the beauty of love. He loved the fiery prayer of the madman Grisha, and the physical pleasure of horse riding and bathing, drinking ice-cold water from a stream and wearing a ball gown, doing fieldwork and experiencing sensual love.

But the stanzas of Pushkin's "The Prophet" were not for nothing burned forever on the first pages of the great Russian literature. The same thing that led Gogol to self-immolation led Tolstoy to renounce his artistic creations and attempt to embody the image of the Prophet in himself.

Throughout my life, I have heard from all sides the lamentations of literature lovers about Tolstoy's departure into the realm of religious and moral preaching. "How many brilliant works of art have we lost because of this!" - Such moans only prove a lack of understanding of Tolstoy's personality and childish thoughtlessness about what Russian artistic genius is. At the end of the life of every genius in Russia, a powerful and invincible need arises: to become not only a messenger, but a prophet - a messenger of the upper world, expressing the highest Truth not only through the images of art, but through the entirety of their life. Finding such a synthesis and embodying it in reality is only given to a negligible few. Lev Tolstoy did not find it, and in his preaching he did not create anything equivalent to "War and Peace". But he could only act this way and not otherwise.

The tragedy of Tolstoy is not that he turned away from artistic literature, but that the gifts necessary to create a majestic image from his own life, which would exceed the significance of his artistic creations, remained unfulfilled in him - the gifts necessary for prophetic service. His spiritual eyes did not open, and he did not see the worlds above. His spiritual hearing did not open, and he did not hear the harmony of the universe. His deep memory did not awaken, and he did not remember what he had seen in other layers or incarnations. Shadanakar remained unknown to him, meta-history was incomprehensible, historical processes and goals were not deciphered, and the love of the world and the demands of spirituality were not reconciled. His sermons seem graceless because they were born only of conscience and rely only on logic, and they lack the spiritual knowledge necessary for prophecy.

However, his spiritual thirst was so great and his sense of duty to preach so relentlessly, that for thirty years he tried to teach what his conscience prompted him to do. And because his conscience was deep, his mind sharp, and his mastery of language colossal, his graceless preaching was strong enough to generate the formation of a sect and even spread far beyond the border, spreading the seeds of the idea of non-resistance to evil with evil - seeds that fell on fertile ground in some countries and later gave rise to such movements as Mahatma Gandhi's socio-ethical doctrine.

Thus, after fifty years, the essence of what happened to Tolstoy begins to dawn on us. He mistook his spiritual thirst for a call to preach; his repentance for the right to instruct the world; his embarking on a long and thorny path to prophecy for a sanction for prophecy. He surpassed himself.

But premature preaching, which only increased his pride and entangled him in contradictions, did not speed up but slowed down his movement along the path that remained for him until the revelation of his inner gifts and transformation into a prophet. He felt that he needed some heroic act: either martyrdom for faith or a hermit's retreat from society and culture. And indeed, if he had not become lost in the tangles of his own mind, if he had left home twenty years earlier, first to seclusion, and then to oral preaching to the people, literally traveling the roads of Russia and speaking to simple people in simple words about the Heavenly Russia, about the higher worlds of Shadanakar, about the supreme Truth and universal love, this preaching would have thundered throughout the world, this embodied image of the Prophet would have shone on the eve of the 20th century over all of Europe, over all of humanity, and it is impossible to measure what elevating and purifying influence it would have had on millions and millions of hearts. But, entangled in the nets of his contradictory duties, real and imagined, Tolstoy hesitated for a long time, not daring to believe in the correctness of his understanding, to leave his family and the way of life he had established over so many decades. And when he did believe and act, he was eighty-two, his strength was exhausted, and the long-awaited satisfaction of his spiritual thirst met him already on the other side of the threshold of death.

The one who was Tolstoy no longer drives, it seems, among those who live in circles of Shadanakar, like Lermontov, Gogol, or Dostoevsky.

At the heights of metaculture, he creates something else - something that is even more grandiose for those layers than "War and Peace" is for us. Because the triple gift-duty of a genius-messenger-prophet, for which he struggled with himself for so many years, is only a semblance of the highest forms of service and creativity, carried out in the zatomis of metacultures and even higher - up to the Synclite of Humanity. Earthly creativity is only preparation for creativity in higher worlds. That is why such attentive care of Providential forces is directed towards the destinies and souls of those whom we usually call creators of culture. This is why daemons are sent to them, this is why they are guarded by cherubim, and this is why demonic forces fight for every inch of their lives and for every movement of their souls.

### Chapter 4. Missions and Destinies (Conclusion)

There is a peculiarity in the history of Russian culture which, once noticed, astonishes the mind and becomes the subject of a distressing reflection. When exploring ancient Greek mythology, one cannot help but notice the diversity of highly charged expressions of the Feminine Principle. Without Athena, Artemis, Aphrodite, Demeter, without the nine muses, without numerous goddesses and lesser demi-goddesses, Olympic mythology is absolutely unthinkable. Similarly, the heroic-human plan of Greek mythology is unthinkable without Helen, Andromache, Penelope, Antigone, and Phaedra.

One cannot imagine the spiritual world of the ancient Germans without Freya, Frigg, without Valkyries, and their heroic epic without the images of Brünnhilde, Gudrun, and Kriemhild.

In no culture do women and the Feminine occupy as significant a place in the pantheon, mythology, and epic, and later in all forms of art, as in Indian culture. The goddess Saraswati and the goddess Lakshmi reign on the highest thrones. Later, but already for two thousand years, Brahmanism and Hinduism have erected thousands of temples, carved millions of statues of the Great Mother of the world—Kali-Durga, the Creator and Destroyer of the universe.

Painting, poetry, sculpture, drama, dance, philosophy, theology, worship, folklore, even everyday life—everything in India is saturated with experiences of the Feminine Principle: sometimes fiery, sometimes tender, sometimes strict.

Not only the pantheon, but also the epics of every nation are familiar, to a greater or lesser degree, with feminine images that are beloved by the people and carried by artists from one tale to another, from one art form to another, from one age to another.

But what do we see in Russia?

In the earliest pre-Christian stage, in the pale East Slavic pantheon, there was not a single feminine name comparable in the reverence it evoked to that of Yarila or Perun.

In the Christian pantheon, the cult of the Mother of God, completely transferred to us from Byzantium, and veneration of several Byzantine female saints.

The folk legends about St. Fevronia of Murom evoke only a feeling of dismal disappointment in anyone who has previously encountered this image through its variant in the opera-mystery of Rimsky-Korsakov.

The image of Yaroslavna is barely sketched out in "The Tale of Igor's Campaign"; for six hundred years thereafter, neither fairy tales nor visual arts nor even poetry attempted to create a more profound, more developed version of this image. It was approaching the end of the seventh century after the creation of the brilliant poem when, finally, the image of Yaroslavna sounded anew in Borodin's opera.

The entire colossal circle of tales, both Kievian and Novgorodian, is almost completely devoid of female characters. 

If we don't count the legend of Amur and Psyche that God knows where it came from, which turned into our fairy tale about Scarlet Flower, then in the vast sea of Russian fairy tales, there seems to be only one bright female character with profound meaning: Vasilisa the Wise.

And such a desert lasted not just one or two centuries, but a thousand years, up until the 19th century.

And suddenly, Tatiana Larina appeared. Followed by Lyudmila Glinka. And as if a certain Aaron struck a dead rock with a miraculous wand: a stream of amazing characters, each deeper, more poetic, heroic, touching, and captivating than the last: Lisa Kalitina, Elena from "Eve," Asya, Zinaida, Lukerya from "Living Relics," Princess Maria Volkonskaya, Natasha Rostova, Grushenka Svetlova, Maria Timofeevna Lebyadkina, Lisa Khokhlakova, Volkonskaya and Trubetskaya from Nekrasov, Katerina from Ostrovsky, Marfa from Mussorgsky, the mother of Manefa and Flenushka from Melnikov-Pechersky, the grandmother from "Obyryv" by Goncharov, the grandmother from "Childhood" by Gorky, "The Lady with the Dog," "Three Sisters," and "The Seagull" by Chekhov, "Olesya" by Kuprin, and finally, the Beautiful Lady by Blok.

This is a direct consequence of the rift that occurred between Yarosvet and the second witzraor.

After the capture of Paris, the second demon of statehood was filled with immeasurable pride and something akin to what psychiatrists call megalomania. Enveloping the king and other leaders of the Russian state, he achieved the hollowing out of the Sacred Union's original idea, and a regime known as Arakcheevism took hold within the country. Finally, the demiurge made a demand of Zhrugr, a kind of ultimatum: not to interfere with Alexander I's perception of the demiurgic envelopment, which at that time mainly involved the idea of immediate fundamental reforms: the liberation of the peasantry and the convocation of a nationwide and permanent Zemsky Sobor. Witzraor rejected these demands. Then, in 1819, the demiurge's sanction was lifted from him, and Yarosvet turned his illuminating weapon against Zhrugr for the first time: part of the citadel of Igv in Drukkarg was destroyed; the envelopment of Navna, which had until then been vainly striving to penetrate the consciousness of the creative layers of the super-people through these centuries-old means, finally gained access to them. It is highly significant that the birth of the first image from the female pantheon of Russia - Tatiana Larina - falls precisely on the years following 1819. An open struggle began between the two hierarchies. One of its types, from the perspective of witzraor, was the violent termination of life in Enrof of those people who were carriers of bright missions, and in direct connection with this are the tragic deaths, or rather killings, of Griboedov, Pushkin, Lermontov, the darkening and entanglement in hopeless contradictions of Gogol, Alexander Ivanov, Mussorgsky, Lev Tolstoy, premature deaths of Vladimir Solovyov and Chekhov.

The history of heraldry in Russian literature is a chain of tragedies,
a chain of unfinished missions.

    The dark fate of the Russian poet.
    An inscrutable destiny leads
    Pushkin to the barrel of a gun,
    Dostoevsky to the gallows.

    M. Voloshin

But it (not destiny, but Witzraor, and sometimes even Urparp himself) - killed some, and new ones took their place. And in this series, the activity of a great writer who possessed the highest degree of artistic talent, Turgenev, has a special significance.

Of course, Turgenev's characters of "superfluous people" are very lifelike and very interesting for a historian. But - only for a historian. In my opinion, the material that would be attractive to a psychologist is not contained in the figures of Rudin, Lavretsky, or Litvinov, and none of them excites meta-historical interest because they do not express or reflect either meta-historical entities or meta-historical processes. Of course, the figure of Bazarov is more symptomatic than others, but the enormous meta-historical significance of Turgenev's work lies elsewhere.

Turgenev's mission was to create a gallery of female characters influenced by Navna and Zventy-Sventana. 

Perhaps due to his peculiar and deprived personal fate, or maybe due to some deeper, innate properties of his temperament and talent, Turgenev understood and loved love more than any other writer of his generation, but only in its early stages. He was a genius poet of "first dates" and "first explanations". However, each time, the course of events leads to a catastrophe, which occurs even before the destinies of the lovers are united. Perhaps this was influenced by the prejudice of writers from previous eras who believed that "happy love" was an unpromising and plotless subject. However, it seems more correct to see in this characteristic of Turgenev's novels and stories a reflection of a certain life experience: this experience did not provide Turgenev with material for a different development of the love plot.

And yet he tried to overcome his own inadequacy. One of his most wonderful heroines, Elena, as is well known, becomes associated with Insarov, becoming his companion on all the paths of his journey and a participant in his life's mission. But having thus charted a way out of the vicious circle, Turgenev was unable to find in his reserve of life experiences the material that would allow him to develop and clothe this plot in artistic flesh and blood. Moreover, having already brought the two heroes together in their common life's work, Turgenev succumbed to his characteristic love melancholy and caused Insarov to die, leaving Elena to continue her husband's work alone. And the features of Turgenev's aesthetics of love continued to be evident: apparently, it was only those collisions that rang with the inevitable note of sorrow, of fracture, of the rupture between dream and reality - the poignant melody of the sadness of the irreparable - that used his special, artistic love. Other collisions, apparently, seemed to him insufficiently beautiful. Thus, there are people and even whole epochs for whom ruins appear more poetic than any building living life to the fullest. But if we recall that in his time, Navna continued to remain a prisoner of Zhrugr, and the citadel of Igva was only partially destroyed by Yarosvet, then the inadequacy of Turgenev's love poems will cease to seem to us the result of only his own personal collisions and will be understood in all its objectivity and inevitability.

And yet Elena is the first image of a Russian woman breaking out of the centuries-old confinement of female destiny, out of the narrow predeterminedness of her customs and moving into what had until then been considered the prerogative of only men: into the public struggle, into the vast expanse of social action. The feminine-heroic line, the line of Navna, at the dawn of Russian culture rises the monumental figure of Princess Olga, later - Marfa Posadnitsa and Boyarina Morozova, and in the era preceding Turgenev - the figures of women Decembrists - this line rose to a new level in the image of Elena and found for the first time its artistic embodiment.

No matter how much we have written about Turgenev's female characters, from Pisarev to the latest high school student, it seems to me that the character of Lisa Kalitin has not yet been properly evaluated. This is natural.
It is undervalued because the most influential criticism, publicistic and literary studies for a hundred years were in the hands of those who lamented Gogol's departure from artistic literature into the realm of religious and moral preaching, who were outraged by similar aspirations of Tolstoy, who ridiculed every writer who wanted to show with their creativity or prove through their way of life that the religious thirst in humanity has not faded away. Not only the departure to the monastery, but the idea of the monastery itself was considered by Russian critics and society as a reactionary, fundamentally flawed idea. The entire century that has passed since 1855 has been marked by the debunking and overthrow of self-righteous religious ideals. Even mystical thinkers like Merezhkovsky did not dare to approach the idea of a monastery, at least not from the perspective of its justification at certain stages of religious and cultural development of the individual or the nation. One could have thought that deeply religious people (and Lisa belonged to their number) go to monasteries without weighing, considering, or understanding themselves, and for some foolish caprice throw their young lives into some black hole. That is, they commit something like spiritual suicide, and only because they did not have the fortune to meet such progressive, highly cultured people like us: a sober voice, a cheerful call from our side would certainly have prevented the misguided from a fatal step. As if the drama that unfolded in Lisa's life did not strike at the most cherished, tenderest thing she carried within her: her religious conscience. The collision occurred between this conscience and love - and Lisa could only love once in her life (she was a model of monogamous character), and love was as sacred to her as her devotion to goodness and truth. She understood, and understood perfectly, that for her, for a person of such conscience and such love, to untie this knot in the conditions of our human world is impossible. No sage can think of another way out of the situation, unless he wants to see Lisa as she was in Turgenev's time, and not as he wishes. And if the knot can only be untied - unimaginably - in another world, then what can fill and make sense of the remaining years of life in Enrof, if not preparing and purifying oneself for a worthy transition to that world where the most complex knots will be called? And if so, what path, if not monastic, is firmer and straighter than all, leading more directly and truly than all to this purification? - However, it is also true that it is impossible to explain this to people who are as outraged by Lisa as they are by Gogol and Tolstoy. What do they know about what this purest heart could achieve in the forty or fifty years that it had to beat under the nun's habit? Perhaps the same unconditional fruits of holiness that were achieved by the great ascetics and ascetic women who enjoyed national recognition!.. - That's who Turgenev didn't have to save or recreate in his afterlife - it was Lisa Kalitina. Perhaps the opposite happened, and Lisa took away many sins from Ivan Sergeyevich after his death.

But even more significant is another image with which we become acquainted through Turgenev's artistic recreation; more significant, among other things, because in it he tells not of the Russian woman's entrance onto the path of righteousness, but of righteousness as such, already attained and completing the earthly road. This is Luka from the stunning essay "Living Relics" - one of the pearls of Russian literature. What can be said about it? Every word is full of profound meaning; one must not comment, but only immerse oneself in this masterpiece. Turgenev has overcome everything here: his own inadequacy, literary prejudices, the combative secular spirit of the era, his not entirely justified (because one-sidedly passionate) love for youth, and his eternal fear of illness and death. As is well known, Luka was not purely a creative Turgenevian image: in "Living Relics" he portrayed a meeting between the writer and his former serf mother many years later. It is doubtful that he himself fully understood the depth hidden in Luka's simple words, which he conscientiously reproduced. It is also difficult to imagine that he understood the symbolism - not the symbolism, to be more precise, but the mystical reality of the sultry field that Luka harvests in her "dream", the sickle becoming a moon-shaped sickle in her hair, and the groom - not Vasya, but Jesus Christ - approaching her over the ears of corn. These are the images that trying to interpret means reducing them; about them, as Turgenev himself expressed it, "you can only point - and pass by".

In any case, Russia has created only two female images of this type and level: Fevronia and Lukeria.

The one who follows the exposition of my thoughts probably expects me to attempt to characterize the other bearers of the gift of prophecy in Russian literature, such as Alexei Tolstoy, Tyutchev, Leskov, Chekhov, after Turgenev. But the framework of my main topic prompts me to postpone the presentation of my thoughts on Tyutchev, Leskov, and Chekhov indefinitely, on Alexei Tolstoy - until a special article about him, and to precede the characterization of Blok with a characterization of another figure: Vladimir Solovyov.

What a strange figure Vladimir Solovyov is on the horizon of Russian culture! Not a genius, but not just a talent either; that is, as a poet, perhaps a talent, and not even one of the very great ones, but there is something in his poems that is not covered by the concept of talent. A righteous man? Yes, Solovyov's ethical image was exceptional, but it is still known that he did not free himself from many of his weaknesses during his lifetime. A philosopher? Yes, he is the only Russian philosopher deserving of that title without any exaggeration, but his system remained unfinished, had little significance in the history of Russian culture, and remained almost unknown abroad. Who is he, then? A prophet? But where, exactly, and in what forms did he prophesy and about what? Perhaps, finally, the "silent prophet," as Merzhkovsky called him - a prophet signifying certain spiritual realities not with words, but with the whole image of his personality? Perhaps the last assumption is closest to reality, and yet it does not coincide with reality.

Solovyov's philosophical activity was dictated by an intention that he defined for himself very early on: to establish the basis of modern positive philosophy under the theological teaching of Orthodoxy. Of course, he often went far beyond this task and at certain stages of his life even deviated from strict orthodoxy, as a result of which his seminal work "La Russie et l'eglise universeile" (Russia and the Universal Church) could not even be published in Russia. But he was constantly concerned about not falling into religious schism, and probably nothing seemed more repulsive to him than the fate of a heresiarch.

And yet he turned out to be - not a heresiarch, of course - but a precursor of the movement that will still have to be fully defined in the future and to which Orthodox orthodoxy, in any case at first, may relate as something close to heresy.

Vladimir Solovyov was a great spiritual visionary. He had a certain spiritual experience that, while not very wide-ranging, in terms of the height of the layers of Shadanakar that were revealed to him, surpassed the experiences of Eckhart, Boehme, Swedenborg, Ramakrishna, Ramanuja, Patanjali, and, for Russia, was truly unparalleled. These were three visions, or, as Solovyov himself called them in his poem about them, "three meetings": the first of which he had at the age of eight while visiting a church with his nanny, the second as a young man in the British Museum library in London, and the third and most grandiose - shortly after the second, at night, in the desert near Cairo, where he went from England, overcoming many obstacles, in response to an inner voice. Those interested in and unfamiliar with this unique religious document are referred to the poem "Three Meetings": it speaks for itself. I am unable to quote it at this time, and I do not dare to convey its content in my own words. I will only dare to state that Solovyov experienced the revelation of Zvonta-Sventana three times, and with particular fullness the third time - that is, the admiration in Raoris, one of the highest layers of Shadanakar, where Zvonta-Sventana was then present. This revelation was experienced by him in the form of a vision, perceived through spiritual sight, spiritual hearing, spiritual smell, organs of contemplation of cosmic panoramas and meta-historical perspectives - that is, through almost all higher organs of perception that suddenly revealed themselves in him. Searching in the history of the European religious circle for any analogue or, better to say, anticipation of such a spiritual experience, Solovyov could not stop at anything except the Gnostic idea of Sophia, the Wisdom of God. But this idea in the Gnostic Valentine is complicated by multilayered speculative constructions that, in Solovyov's experience, seemed to coincide in almost nothing, especially since he himself considered any speculations on this subject unacceptable and even blasphemous. This idea did not receive any further development or theological elaboration and dogmatization in historical Christianity. This is natural, given that the emanation in Shadanakar of the great feminine monad of the God-born took place only at the turn of the XIX century - a meta-historical event, very vaguely perceived at that time by Goethe, Novalis, and perhaps Zhukovsky. Therefore, before the XIX century, there simply could not have been any mystical experience similar to Solovyov's experience: the object of such experience did not yet exist in Shadanakar. In the era of Gnosticism, something else was perceived: the descent of the forces of World Femininity into Shadanakar shortly before Christ, which had no personal expression, no concentration in a certain God-born monad. The echo of this event reached the consciousness of the great Gnostics and was cast into the idea of Sophia. In Eastern Christianity, the image of Sophia, the Wisdom of God, nevertheless persisted, although it remained completely unrelated to Orthodox theological doctrine and even somewhat contradicted it. Weak attempts to reconcile the two led only to absurdity, such as understanding Sophia as a conditional-symbolic expression of Logos, Christ.

Solovyov himself believed that in the 1990s of the last century, the time had not yet come for openly discussing the connection between the idea of Sophia and Orthodox teaching. He well understood that the intrusion of such a lofty higher reality into the ossified circle of Christian dogma could break that circle and cause a new schism in the church. And he saw schism as a great evil, helpful to the coming Antichrist. Therefore, he was preoccupied, as is well known, with the opposite: the reunification of churches. Consequently, he never proclaimed the new revelation until the end of his prematurely ended life. He only allowed himself to mention it in a light, unassuming poetic work that made no claim to anything. His personal modesty and deep chastity, which manifested themselves, among other things, in the crystal clarity of language even in purely philosophical works, prompted him to surround the tale of the three encounters, the three most significant events of his life, with a playful, unpretentious, everyday frame. The poem remained little-known outside the circle of people who were specifically interested in such documents - a circle that was even small in our country even before the revolution, and now is entirely devoid of the opportunity to manifest itself outside the walls of its isolated rooms. But the influence of this poem and some other Solovyov's lyrical poems dedicated to the same topic had an impact on the idealistic philosophy of the beginning of the century - Trubetskoy, Florensky, Bulgakov - and on the poetry of the Symbolists, especially Blok.

From everything that has just been said, it is as if it is clear that the upcoming birth of Zventa-Sventana in Heavenly Russia, by the forces of the demiurge Yarosvet and Navna, has the most direct relation to Solovyov's ideas, because Zventa-Sventana is nothing else but an expression of the Feminine hypostasis of the Divinity for Shadanakar. Therefore, it is clear to everyone that such ideas, stemming from the revelation of the Eternal Femininity, do not coincide with the understanding of the Trinity in Orthodox Christianity. It is not surprising that V. Solovyov, who was concerned with the reunification of Christianity rather than its further fragmentation into confessions and sects, did not rush to proclaim his prophetic spiritual experience.

There may have been a second reason. Solovyov, who was well acquainted with the history of religion, could not have been unaware of the facts showing that intrusions into religious organizations and the cult of the differentiation between the divine-male and divine-female elements were fraught with exceptional dangers. These intrusions, inadequately understood spiritually and insufficiently separated from the sexual sphere of humanity, lead to the confusion of spirituality with sexuality, to the sacrilegious identification of cosmic spiritual marriage with sensual love, and ultimately to ritual debauchery. As far as can be judged, the positive experience - the contemplation of Zvenzdana-Sventana in this guise of superhuman and supermundane feminine beauty - was so overwhelming for Solovyov, so incompatible with anything human or elemental, that since then the spiritual seer was repelled by any descent into layers of opposite principles. He knew, and knew well, of the existence of the Great Harlot and the possible terrible substitutions that lurked for any consciousness that was not clear enough or sufficiently strengthened to perceive the call of the Eternal Feminine through the murky layers of passionate, contradictory emotions. But the existence of the great elemental force of humanity - Lilith, the sculptress and guardian of the flesh of the nations - apparently remained unclear to him. He uses the expression "Common Aphrodite" two or three times, but evidently understands by it an indefinite mixture of two elements: the elemental and the satanic. Their confusion and lack of differentiation in Solovyov's ideas are undeniable. But the warning about the danger lurking in this direction, even in such an indistinct form, was still highly necessary. After what happened to Alexander Blok, one can only regret that Solovyov's warning was not more elaborately developed.

There is not a drop of Solovyov's own fault in the fact that his mission remained unfinished. Nothing separated him from transitioning from the stage of spiritual vision to the stage of prophecy, except for overcoming some minor human weaknesses. It is unlikely that there could be any doubt that if his life had lasted a few more years, these weaknesses would have been overcome. His mission was to prophesy about Zvente-Sventana and create historical and religious prerequisites for the emergence of the Rose of the World. Then the Rose of the World, or rather its seed, could have arisen within Orthodoxy, changing it and bringing it closer to all the spiritual currents of the right hand. This could have happened in Russia, even under conditions of constitutional monarchy. Solovyov would have had to accept the spiritual rank and, raising it in the eyes of the people to an unprecedented height with the authority of a visionary, righteous person, and miracle worker, become the leader and transformer of the church. It is known that in the last years of his life, the perspectives of the last cataclysms of history and the panorama of the coming kingdom of the antichrist were increasingly revealed before Solovyov's inner gaze, and he focused on the dream of the reunification of churches and even the future union of Judaism and Islam with Christianity to fight the common enemy: the imminent coming of the antichrist. His letters contain undeniable evidence that in the last years he saw his calling in preparing public-religious consciousness for this struggle. We cannot know in what organizational and structural forms of religiosity he would have combined the pursuit of this task with prophetic service to the Eternal Feminine. These forms would not have depended on him alone, but also on the objective conditions of Russian and world history. But even the course of this history would have been different if the first thirty years of the twentieth century had been illuminated by the radiance of this most luminous human image, who walked the straight path to becoming a miracle worker and the greatest visionary of all time.

The calling remained unfinished, the preaching - unspoken, the spiritual knowledge - not fully passed on to anyone: Solovyov was torn from Enrof in the prime of his life and strength by that demonic will which saw in him an uncompromising and dangerous enemy.

The charisma of his moral personality, his ideas, and even his appearance - the ideal image of a prophet in the truest sense of the word - had an extraordinary impact on the predisposed circles of his contemporaries, despite the incompleteness of his religious doctrine. Over the fifteen years that passed from his death to the revolution, a multivolume collection of his works was published, and a whole literature about Solovyov and his philosophy emerged. This work was cut short forty years later with the advent of the predecessors he warned of. Like a shroud of tomb silence, a deaf water of silence closed over the name of Vladimir Solovyov for the entire duration of his life. His works and writings about him were made almost inaccessible, and the philosopher's name only slipped into footnotes to Alexander Blok's poems as the name of an unlucky ideologist of reaction who impressed some of his most regressive ideas on the young poet. The philosophical poverty of Russia led to the proclamation of such figures of the 19th century as the summits of philosophy, who only had journalistic, literary-critical, or popular scientific articles and two or three artistically helpless novels to their credit. The only philosopher in Russia who created a methodologically impeccable and entirely independent work, "The Critique of Abstract Principles," a remarkable theodicy of "Justification of Good," and a series of prophetic concepts in "Readings on the God-Manhood," "Three Conversations," "Russia and the Universal Church," turned out to be almost non-existent. It has come to the point where entire intellectual generations have never even heard the name of Vladimir Solovyov, who rests at the Novodevichy Cemetery in Moscow under a desecrated stone.

That Pushkin was mighty, Dostoevsky great, Lermontov famous, and Tolstoy like the sun in the Synclite of Russia seems natural and logical. How millions upon millions would be amazed if they were shown that the one who was a forgotten philosopher-idealist in Russia now reaches and creates in such worlds where many of the luminaries of the Synclite have not yet risen.

### Chapter 5. The Fall of the Herald

All the vast research literature about Alexander Blok arose in specific conditions, which are too well known to all of us. It is not surprising that the problems of Blok's internal evolution have yet to be fully explored. There is, of course, an official version that Blok was the expression of the world view of a decadent era, with an inseparable mysticism inherent only to such eras. It is believed that he carried within him the seeds of new, healthy beginnings, which led to his joining the revolution of 1917, but that his powers were already broken, and that this is the reason for his creative silence in the last years of his life and his premature end.

In this context, the autobiographical poems of the most autobiographical of poets are not considered as documents that often literally reflect the events and processes of his personal life, but as some kind of artistic greatness, whose meaning lies only in the height of their purely poetic quality and in the reflections on the external reality of the era that they contain.

Meanwhile, Blok belongs to the category of poets whose poems can have an artistic and emotional impact on anyone, but a person deprived of mystical feeling and experience is as powerless to "understand" Blok as a person without knowledge of higher mathematics is to understand the theory of relativity. This defect will be generously remedied over time.

Therefore, I will only outline here a few milestones of Blok's religious and mystical tragedy, which, as I understand it, predetermined the course of his poetic evolution, his downward movement on the ladder of life, his fatal end, and his redemptive afterlife. But even this limited task forces me to break the structure of the book at this point and dedicate a separate chapter to Alexander Blok. The justification for this is that through the material of this chapter, I am approaching the circle of realities related to the manifestation of Zventa-Sventana in the consciousness of people, the danger of substituting Her forces with demonic forces, and one of the five upcoming cults of the Rose of the World.

It is well-known that in his early youth, during the period of his still entirely naive and vague poetic inspirations, marked by nothing original, Blok became acquainted not only with philosophy, but also with the poetry of Vladimir Solovyov. He only saw Solovyov once and, it seems, was not even introduced to the famous philosopher at the time. Blok himself tells about this meeting in the little-known but remarkable meta-historical article "The Knight-Monk". It happened at the requiem and funeral of some literary or public figure, on a gray, winter day in the capital. The young poet, still unknown to anyone, could not, of course, take his eyes off the figure of the lord of his thoughts, a figure that impressed people with much less sensitivity. But their eyes met only once; the blue eyes of the spirit-seer of Zventy-Sventana stopped on the transparent gray-blue eyes of the tall, handsome youth with his curly, proudly lifted head. God knows what Solovyov read in those eyes; only his gaze strangely slowed down. If we recall Blok's passionate love for Solovyov's poetry and his extraordinary reverence for his personality, it will seem natural that at the moment of this first and only meeting between them, the eyes of the future creator of "Verses About the Beautiful Lady" reflected so much, so much that the great mystic could easily read in them both the cherished dream and the too passionate soul, and the seductions lurking in her sweet and irreparable substitutions.

When describing this meeting, Blok clearly holds back. His characteristic modesty and natural reluctance to expose his overly intimate and personal experiences in a journal article prevented him from fully expressing the meaning of this meeting, which took place under the rare fluttering snowflakes of a Petersburg day. It is only evident that this meeting stayed with Blok for his entire life, and that he attached some special significance to it.

Three years later, "Verses about the Beautiful Lady" appeared in bookstores. Solovyov, the only person who could have understood these verses to their very depths, supported his young follower on his difficult path and warned him of the looming dangers, but he had already passed away. However, literary rumor recognized Alexander Blok as the successor and poetic heir of the prophet of Eternal Femininity.

It is not surprising that neither critics nor the public of that time were able to fully comprehend the mystical duality, even multiplicity, that was already evident in this first collection of Blok's poetry. The world of these ideas and feelings, these hazy hierarchies, was still new and unknown, although everyone seemed to believe that they had perfectly deciphered this poetic cipher as a game of artistic techniques.

Nevertheless, a textual analysis allows for the precise identification of the presence of three significantly different layers here.

First of all, this collection enchants the poetic ear with motifs that sometimes sound like proud and courageous metal, with intonations of solemn self-affirmation:

    ... They have thrust into my heart
    The reddish coal of a prophet!
    ... I kept them in the precincts of John,
    An immobile sentinel, guarding the flame of lamps.
    And now - She and to Her - my Hosanna -
    The crown of labours - above all rewards.

But it is not with cosmic visions or pure universal radiance that a dim and quiet ray of Femininity shines here. It passes as if through the mists rising from Russian meadows and lakes, it is coloured in the specific shades of Russian metaculture. The very name - the Beautiful Lady - still speaks of distant reminiscences of the West: no wonder Blok was always so close to the world of German legends and the romanticism of the Middle Ages. But no: these reflections of Europe do not penetrate deeper than the name. The image of the one named the Beautiful Lady is framed by Russian landscapes, fir forests, skete lamps, and the dreamy poetry of enchanted terems. The old manorial culture, dreamy, inclined to decline, but still alive, breathes in these verses - the late stage of this culture, its evening twilight. If it were not a twenty-two-year-old youth who wrote about the Beautiful Lady, but a thirty- or forty-year-old master of words, a lord of his own feelings and an analyst of his own ideas, he would probably give Her a different name, and we would see the clearest and most transparent reflection of one of the Great Sisters: the Ideal Cathedral Soul of the Russian super-people. It is precisely because of this that Andrei Bely, Sergei Solovyov, and Sergei Bulgakov could not recognize in the Beautiful Lady Her to Whom the deceased seer dedicated his "Three Meetings", knowing nothing yet of hierarchies such as Navna; they were perplexed by the too human, too national costumes of the Beautiful Lady, alien to the worlds of Holy Sophia.

But there is also another layer to these poems, and the experienced Solovyov would have made one uneasy. The collection was written during Blok's infatuation with his fiancée, Dmitrievna Mendeleeva. The living voice of human passion is only veiled by the matte, soft sounds of the poetry; the constant intertwining of the yearning, love-struck motif with the name and image of the Beautiful Lady ultimately plunges all of the poems into a hazy, anxious, and elusive uncertainty. It is evident that the poet himself does not even realize this uncertainty, that he is entirely immersed in it, inside of it, in a romantic fusion of the unspoken earthly with the unrealized celestial.

Unrealized: this is the root of his misfortune. Look at the portraits of young Blok: a beautiful, proud, and charming face that seems to gaze from the depths of a dream; a stamp of some indistinctness, something dreamy, almost somnambulistic. This has already been noted by some of his contemporaries. Yes, guided like a sleepwalker by his daimon during mediumistic sleep, he would mix the reflections of memories with the boiling emotions of his daily life, of love and passion, and the uncontrolled nature of his soul's structure would prevent him from noticing that he was on the path not only to danger and impropriety, but also to sacrilege: to allowing purely human, sexual, elemental streams into the cult of the Eternal Feminine, which Vladimir Solovyov called "the greatest abomination".

There is something like a "soul" in a lyrical work - a song, romance, hymn (of course, I mean only a small number of them: the criterion is their significance and talent). These subtle material condensations exist in various layers, depending on their content. There is no anthropomorphism, of course, in their appearance; rather, they are similar to fibers of mist of various shades and musical sound. Enlightenment is possible for them, occurring in parallel with the enlightenment of their creators; subsequently, they are included in the volume of his personality. Those among them which are radiant from the moment of their creation, have an illuminating and uplifting effect on both the creator and those who perceive them. But verses filled with despair and desperation or appealing to lower instincts of lust, envy, and hatred, with no enlightened sensuality, not only lower the spiritual level of many of those who perceive them, but also become a curse for their creator. On his path there will inevitably be such emanations when these souls of verses, muddy, sensual, malicious and sticky, will surround his own soul in groups, blocking out any light and demanding admission for their twisting and sucking fibers. Blok's lines in the later period of his life:

    Be silent, cursed books!
    I never wrote you! -

an expression of a desperate attempt to rid himself of the consequences of what he himself created.

Three more years had passed. The first revolution had raged and died down. University was over and family life was settled. But - first occasionally, then more and more often - wine and the chaos of night in Petersburg began to predetermine the color of months and years.

And here the second volume comes out of print: "Unexpected Joy".

The title is beautiful, but not very suitable. There is no Unexpected Joy here (this is the name of one of the revered miraculous icons of the Mother of God), no joy in general, and nothing unexpected at all. Everything is exactly what one would expect. The only joyful thing is that a colossal poet has appeared, such as has not been seen in Russia for a long time, but a poet with the shadows of a serious spiritual illness on his face.

Only naive people could have expected from the author of "Verses about the Beautiful Lady" that the next stage of his life, and especially at the age of twenty-six, would be a decisive step towards some kind of enlightenment and sunny harmony. As if the burden of sensual and unresolved emotions that had already invaded his soul's cult could disappear from where and why after three years of living with a young wife and listening to Gypsy songs in restaurants.

When you read critical reviews of these poems by Andrei Bely or Merezhkovsky, that is, those from whom one could expect the greatest sensitivity and understanding, first comes confusion, then a sense of bitterness, and in the end, deep sadness. What a lack of care, friendliness, love, even simple human delicacy! It seems that even some kind of malicious joy shines through these puritanical tirades about Block's "betrayal" and "fall". And everything is dressed in such a brazenly instructive tone that even an angel in Block's place would probably shout, "If I fall, then I fall. It is better to be a publican than a Pharisee."

And yet, betrayal did happen. And essentially, each of these uninvited judges was right.

Block was not a "Poor Knight." If the vision, "incomprehensible to the mind," was shown to him, then it was in a deep somnambulistic sleep. In order "not to look at women" and "not to remove the steel bars from his face," he was too young, healthy, physically strong, and always felt a deep aversion to cultivating himself: it seemed to him to be violence against his own inalienable human rights. Lower freedom, self-freedom was too dear to him. Moreover, he was a person with increased spontaneity, strong sensuality, and, as I have already noted, lack of control. Premature aspirations towards the disembodied led to a rebellion of the elements. The naturalness of such evolution would certainly have been clear to Solovyov if he had known the verses about the Beautiful Lady. Didn't he predict her in that short moment when he gazed into the dreamy blue eyes of an unknown young poet?

However, this evolution was natural but not inevitable. It is unlikely that one can fully justify anyone's weakness or unwillingness to understand themselves. Blok was not a genius, but he was intelligent enough to analyze and understand the polarity, hostility, and irreconcilability of the forces that attracted him. Once he understood this, he could at least divide their projections in his life and in his work, paying tribute to the elemental but not mixing deadly poison with sacramental wine, not confusing the highest source of divine wisdom and love with the Great Harlot.

In the second and third volumes of his poetry, Blok's artistic genius reaches its zenith. Many dozens of his poems belong to the brightest precious stones of Russian poetry. The sound of his verse is such that henceforth, Blok consolidates his position as the most musical of Russian poets. There even appears something that exceeds musicality, something bewitching and enchanting, a special magic of verse that before Blok could only be found in the best lyrical poems of Lermontov and Tyutchev. But Blok himself said that he did not like people who preferred his second volume. No wonder! You cannot expect a man who harbored love in his soul to be pleased with the adoration of people who praised his betrayal.

In both "Unexpected Joy" and "Earth in Snow," a poignant, anxious, sweet, and intoxicating motif grows and varies: a burning love - mystical and sensual - for Russia. Who, besides Blok, dared to exclaim:

"Oh, my Russia! My wife! The long path is clear to us in pain!"

This love sometimes soars to a prayerful ecstasy - Kulikovo Field, the trumpeting cries of swans, white mists over Nepyadva...

    And in the mist over Nepyadva asleep,
    Directly onto me
    You descended, in a garment of streaming light,
    Not frightening my horse.
    On my steel sword, the waves sparkled like silver,
    Refreshing my dusty chainmail
    And when, in the morning, the black cloud
    Moved by the Horde,
    Your image, uncreated by human hands,
    Shone forever on my shield.

And indeed it is Navna! Who and when wrote so clearly, so precisely, so literally about Her, the great inspirer, the Ideal Soul of Russia, her descent into the hearts of heroes, the fates of defenders of the Motherland, her poets, creators, and martyrs?

No matter what sins weigh down the karma of the one who created such hymns, spiritual death is impossible for him, even if he wished it in some moments: sooner or later, his immortal Self will be extracted by the Cathedral Soul of the people from any purgatory.

Yes... but even the non-created face on the shield cannot remain "bright forever".

    And further the path, and the month is higher,
    And the stars dim in silver.
    And quietly the roofs were illuminated
    In the night village, on the mountain.
    I walk, and the dew grows cold,
    And silver shines on you.
    All about you, unraveling your braid
    For a secret friend in the hut.
    Give me fragrant, soulful potions
    And sweet poison to cloud my mind,
    So that once tasting your delights,
    I will forever remember this night.

Who is this about, to whom is this? - Wide expanses unfold, shrouded in the veil of autumn rains; deserted tracts, hidden villages with ominous lights of taverns; the soul is seized with melancholy and audacity, a passionate thirst to lose oneself in these expanses, to forget oneself in reckless, forbidden love - somewhere by the wandering fires, among midnight grasses reddening with witching fires.

Any dens of the abyssal, subterranean life, blasphemy and shamelessness, drunken darkness and debauchery—

    Yes, and such is my Russia,
    More precious to me than any other land.

Not just any Russia, but already this Russia. The frenzied jingle of mad troikas can be heard, the cries of drunken voices, a wild song—whether it's revelry or already robbery—and she, rushing in a witch's, a sorceress's dance:

    ...By what light
    Do you tease and lure?
    In this whirl
    When will you tire?
    Whose songs? And sounds?
    —What do I fear?
    The crushing sounds
    And—Free Russia?

Yes, Rus', but what kind? What does it have in common with Navna in this lawless, devilish beauty?

    Where the snowstorm sweeps fiercely
    Up to the roof—the fragile dwelling,
    And the girl sharpens a knife
    Under the snow on her wicked lover.

She danced in circles, clouded with potions, dizzy with caresses, and now she's sharpening a knife.
Not Navna, not the Ideal Soul, but its opposite.

At first he sang about Navna, taking her in blindness for the Eternal Femininity. Now he sings about Velga, taking her for Navna in his increased blindness.

But this is just the beginning. Passionate, unquenchable love for Russia, love for its polar-hostile elements, a mystical voluptuousness towards it, that is, voluptuousness towards what by its very nature cannot be the object of physical possession—all this is just one of the channels of his spiritual life in these years. And alongside it arises something else.

First, with two or three descriptive poems, and then increasingly persistently and authoritatively from cycle to cycle, the great city invades his creativity. This is the city of the Bronze Horseman and the Strelka, the port outskirts with sea-smelling alleys, and the white nights over the mirrors of the giant river - but this is no longer just St. Petersburg, not just St. Petersburg. This is the transphysical layer beneath the great city of Enrof, where torch flames can dance in Peter's outstretched hand at night; where Peter himself or some of his doubles can reign over the crossroads of the moonlit streets, summoning thousands of faceless and nameless beings to unite and indulge; where the Sphinx with the "chipped face" is no longer a stone statue from distant Egypt, but a regal chimera woven from ethereal mist... A little more - the chains of lanterns will become murky blue, and not the mass of St. Isaac's Cathedral, but the mass in the form of a dark truncated pyramid - the altar-palace-shrine will emerge from the murky lunar darkness. This is St. Petersburg unseen by physical eyes, but seen and traversed by him: not in poetic inspirations or in night travels across the islands and embankments with the woman he is in love with today - but in those nights when he slept deeply, and someone led him through the places, wastelands, crevices, and winding bridges of infra-Petersburg.

I have already said: among the ambiguous layers of Shadanakar, there is one abode of mighty dark elementals of feminine nature: demons of great cities. They vampirically lure human hearts into vortex-like whirlpools of passionate thirst that cannot be quenched by anything in our world. They inspire a torturous love-passion for the great city, painful and relentless, like true sensual desire. This is another kind of mystical lust - lust for the city, and specifically for the nocturnal, depraved, or suffocatingly sultry city of summer evenings when even the rustle of crowds flowing through the streets inspires aimless desire. Fleeting encounters, hazy, murky nights arise, but they do not satisfy, only inflame. From this insatiable thirst, from beyond sensual pleasure, an image emerges, unique for each person, but the same that each person who has passed through this path has encountered in the transphysical realms, completely forgotten or appearing as a dream. Oh, not a daimon, no longer a daimon at all, led him in circles of these temptations: someone from the inhabitants of Duggur replaced the daimon with himself, someone from the small demons inspired him with ever greater lust, showing him such forms of spiritual and physical - although not physical - debauchery as are possible in Duggur - and nowhere else.

I'm not sure that "every evening, at the appointed hour," dreaming of his own solitude at a restaurant table, Blok saw things differently, only in his dream, "a maiden's camp, captured by silks," and how "without companions, alone, breathing in perfumes and mists, she sits by the window." But he dreamt of her and poisoned his days and nights with an insatiable longing, because he vaguely remembered meeting her in Duggur.

    And ancient beliefs waft about
    Her supple silks,
    And the hat with mourning feathers,
    And the slender hand in rings.
    And locked in a strange closeness,
    I watch through the dark veil,
    And see the enchanted shore
    And the enchanted distance.

Yes, truly: a stranger. Until the deep memory was revealed,
until Duggur was remembered with clarity, it was impossible
to understand who this was! But neither falls, nor carousing, nor wine will reveal this memory;
and from the longing for the irresistibly attractive but absent in Enrof, from the lust for the one who cannot be forgotten and cannot be fully remembered,
you rush after a ghost "from one passionate night to another," because wine gives an illusion of her proximity, and physical closeness - an illusion of possessing the unattainable.

The entire "Snow Mask" is saturated with vague memories of Duggur. Almost every poem begins and suddenly the real plan shifts, instantaneously oscillating all the threads of the verse - and now it's a landscape of a different, adjacent world, a different Neva, different blizzards, different masses along the banks - some icy masses with caves and grottos, some flights on "overcast horses" through the aerial abysses of another layer: infra-Petersburg.

    There is no way out of the blizzard,
    And it's joyful for me to perish.
    It has led me into an enchanted circle,
    And veiled me with the silver of its blizzards...

"The Snow Mask" is a masterpiece among masterpieces. The perfection of verse is captivating, the form of each poem individually and the entire cycle as a whole is unparalleled, the rhythm is unique in its expressiveness, and the emotional intensity reaches its limit. Here, as in many poems of the subsequent volume, Blok is the greatest poet since Lermontov. But the increase in artistic level goes hand in hand with the line of profound spiritual decline. Moreover, each such poem is a stunning document of descents along the stairs of substitution: it is a warning purchased at the cost of destruction.

Confusion, haziness, and ambiguity about what was happening, which in some way mitigated the responsibility for the chain of substitutions committed against the Soul of Russia, are no longer present here. The fatality of the chosen path is now clearly recognized.

    What does it mean to be indifferent? What does it mean to be winged?
    A hundred times whip and reprimand.
    Just to be cursed for a moment with you
    In the fire of the night dawn!

There is hardly any other document in Russian literature that speaks so powerfully and artistically about the thirst for damnation, spiritual rejection, spiritual destruction, and a kind of spiritual suicide. And what can be done here...

Only now can we return to the final question. If the heart desires destruction,

Does it secretly seek the bottom?

First - secretly, and then quite openly. Love for N.N. Volokhova (and "The Snow Mask" is dedicated to her) turns out to be a kind of magical crystal: images of femininity follow one another with incredible persistence, which are not applicable to any woman in our physical layer.

They grow in their transcendence, in their enormity from poem to poem, until finally

    In my icy cave,
    — Daughter of the northern winds!
    From her winged eyes
    Glimmers mist.
    A triple-crested tiara
    Around her forehead.
    Guard me, wicked beasts,
    So that even the angels themselves
    Cannot lift me up with their wings,
    Cannot pierce me with their Gifts
    And their Communion!
    In my darkened cell —
    Two swords.
    Above my bed — signs
    Of black days.
    And my joy streams forth
    In two rays.
    Then the poppies burn and doze off
    From the evil eyes.

It seems clear as day now, what those evil eyes are! Would any sensitive researcher still think that the central female figure "Snow Mask" is a specific woman, beloved by the poet, an actress of a certain theater, N.N. Vologzova? The delicate, intelligent, noble Vologzova, apparently, could never (as far as can be judged from her still unpublished memoirs) fully understand the depths of this love for her: to understand who Blok loved in her, behind her, through her. She seemed to understand this herself, and Blok perhaps as well:

    Among all, you alone do not know
    What kind of birth you are a part of,
    What faith you are baptized in.

After all, it's not for nothing that this meaningful title appears at the end: "The Snow Mask"! It's no wonder that the motive of the masquerade, the motive of a woman's face hidden from view, is present throughout. In a sense, it can be said that for Blok himself, Volokhova was a mask on the face of feminine essence, irresistibly drawing him either into the whirlwinds of stars and snowstorms, or down and down, into the quagmires of Duggur.

Of course, not every one of Blok's poems should be looked at from this perspective. Many of his wonderful poems are completely free from any emotional turmoil. But I am talking here about the main thrust of his path, about the line of his life.

    In the deep twilight of the cathedral
    I read your scroll;
    Your voice - just a moan from the choir,
    A long, dull moan.

With this appeal of some feminine essence to the poet begins one of the poems that Blok did not even dare to publish. The beginning echoes the poems of his youth, when he entered "dark temples," performing a "poor rite": there he awaited "the Beautiful Lady in the flicker of red lamps." Isn't the Fair Lady still shining for her dying singer? What does she say? What will comfort and encourage him? - But her voice sounds cold and severe, barely coming from other distant, ambiguous layers:

    Your groans and torments,
    Your sorrow - what do they mean to me?
    You are only a vague vision
    Of distant and deaf worlds.
    And I have to test you;
    There are many who seek me,
    With an unmatched gaze,
    An unquenchable fire.
    And here is your answer scroll
    In the same place, on the wall,
    For the many passionate tortures
    You have learned on the way to me."

It seems very much like the Fair Lady. To the Fair Lady, the lady of the heavenly courts, a person may also seem like a vision of distant and deaf worlds. The speaker now claims that his suffering, languishing, and sorrow were about her. But who else could they be about, if not the Fair Lady? So, we finally hear in these verses either the voice of the Fair Lady or someone speaking in her voice. So what does she outline in the "answer scroll" for the seeker of her heart:

    You won't know who I am for a long time,
    You won't close your eyes at night,
    You might melt like wax,
    You might die like death.
    And if your sigh "I love" reaches me
    As a distant echo,
    I'll scorch you with thunderous cold laughter
    Like a whip!

So that's who she is! Let her name remain unknown - if she even has a name - but from which worldly chasms, from which infra-physical deserts does this treacherous, predatory voice sound - that seems clearer than clear. Lady... yes, a lady, but not of the heavenly courts, but of others, similar to icy, gray-snowed abysses. This is not yet the Great Whore, but one of the offspring that reign on the steps leading down to her, similar to Velga.

"Here a man burned" - this line by Fet he once took as an epigraph to his poem:

    So that through the pale red glow of art
    They might recognize the deadly fire of life!

But what, exactly, is the fire of life, and what about it is deadly? Blok remained a noble, deeply honest, responsive, and kind person throughout his life. He did not commit anything irreparable, unforgivable, or criminal. His fall was expressed in the outer layer of his life, in the sphere of actions, only through a chain of drunken evenings, passionate nights, and the revelry of the Gypsies. To those who glide over the surface of life, it is not even clear what kind of supposedly terrible fall this is, what kind of death one can speak of. But only those who themselves have something to fall from can understand someone else's fall as a fall. Those who sit in the swamp of life imagine that it is normal for all mortals. When you read Blok's poetry as an autobiographical document, as a confession, then it becomes clear on its own what kind of fall and what kind of death it is.

The third volume is essentially a wasteland. The poet's state of mind is terrible.

    You changed long ago,
    Irrevocably.

The sleepless night tightly embraces everything - the earth, what lies beneath it, and what is above it. One impenetrable page is replaced by another, even more pitch-black. Fragments surviving in memory from transphysical journeys intertwine with everyday life into a single, uninterrupted nightmare. The verse from the Quran comes to mind: "Darkness upon darkness, deep sea".

    I do not hide from you,
    Look at me:
    I stand among the ruins,
    Burnt by the tongues
    Of the infernal fire.

It was during these years that Blok wrote a short memoir article titled "The Knight-Monk", the same one I began this chapter with a reminder about. The title is strange and meaningless without a meta-historical interpretation. What kind of knight was Solovyov during his lifetime - a man who never touched a weapon in his entire life, a doctor of philosophy, a lecturer, a cabinet scientist? And what kind of monk was he - someone who never took any vows, never gave a vow of chastity, and despite his Orthodox religiosity, lived an ordinary secular life? But Blok doesn't talk about the Solovyov that he was. He talks about the Solovyov that he became. How he saw him, after many years, somewhere in other layers: in dark, long robes and with his hands, joined on the hilt of a sword. Clearly, the sword was not physical, and the knighthood was of the kind foreseen only by "The Poor Knight", and the monasticism was not historical, not in Enrof, but not of this world.

There is nothing more natural than the fact that the knight of Zventy-Sventana did not abandon his younger brother, who dreamed of becoming such a knight even after his betrayal. But what exactly happened during their transphysical meetings, which circles they visited, and which truly and irreparably catastrophic falls the poet was saved from - this, of course, must remain Alexander Blok's inviolable secret.

But from what was shown to Blok in the otherworldly wanderings of this period of his life, one circumstance emerged alongside others, which I would like to particularly emphasize. Blok had already shown, even during the period of the Beautiful Lady, that he possessed prophetic abilities in the narrow sense of the word, that is, the ability of historical prediction, although he rarely possessed it. It is worth remembering the poem he wrote two years before the 1905 revolution: "...Is everything peaceful among the people? - No. The Emperor is dead," and especially its ending:

    - Who is he, the people's subduer?
    - Dark, and evil, and fierce:
    A monk at the entrance to the abode
    Saw him - and went blind.

    He drives people into unknown abysses,
    Like herds...
    With an iron staff he drives them...
    - God! Let's run from the Judgment!

Now this ability has been enriched by new experience, but an experience linked only to demonic worlds. Therefore, we will not find any prophecies from Blok about the coming Light, about the reflection of Zventy-Sventana in the historical reality of future epochs, about the Rose of the World, or about the Golden Age of humanity. But the terrible poem "Voice from the Choir" paints a distant future epoch: the one when after the dominance of the Rose of the World over all humanity, the greatest enemy of her and all spirituality will come, the one whom Gagtung nurtures for so many centuries.

    And the final century, more terrible than all,
    We will both see.
    All the sky will be covered with vile sin,
    Laughter will freeze on everyone's lips,
    The anguish of non-existence...

    Spring, child, you will wait -
    Spring will deceive you.
    You will call for the sun in the sky -
    The sun will not rise.
    And when you start to cry out,
    It will fall like a stone...

But he was not given the knowledge of the historical and meta-historical resolution of the universal tragedy of the first zone: he deprived himself of this comfort with his falls, which clouded his spiritual eyes to everything that came from the Heights, and not from the abyss.

After "The Land in Snow," he lived another twelve years. Poems were born less frequently, with longer intervals - monuments of emptiness and late, powerless regrets. And after "Roses and Crosses," the artistic quality of the poems quickly declined, and for a whole five years, we cannot find a single poem marked by high talent from Blok. For the last time, the fading genius was awakened by the Great Revolution. Everything elemental, with which his being was so rich, resonated with the elemental force of the popular storm. With the uniqueness of a genius, the torn rhythms, bursts of passion, scraps of ideas, twisting nights of revolutions, figures embodying entire classes, sailor's revelry, and the recitative of soldiers' tongue twisters were captured and embodied in the famous poem "The Twelve." But in Blok's interpretation of this rebellious era, everything became entangled: his own elemental nature, the rebellious hatred for the old, decrepit order of things, reminiscences of Christian mysticism, his unfulfilled love for the "robber beauty" of Russia - Velga, and his vague faith, contrary to everything, in the future truth of Russia - Navna. As a result, a magnificent artistic monument to the first year of the Revolution was created, but there are no elements of prophecy in this poem - not even just historical foresight. "The Twelve" is the last flash of the lamp, which has no more oil; it is a desperate attempt to find a point of support in what is in itself a historical maelstrom, a raging abyss, and that's it; it is a dying cry.

Death came only three and a half years later. The spiritual darkness of these last years is indescribable. The psyche could no longer bear it, and signs of its decay appeared. Scurvy eased his suffering, or rather - the kind of suffering that is inherent in our physical layer. Blok died at the age of forty-two. However, even during his lifetime, many who met him spoke of him as a living corpse.

I saw him in the summer and autumn of 1949. I have the right and duty to tell something about it. I am proud to say that Blok was and remains my friend, although we never met in life, and when he died, I was still a child. But on some stretches of my journey, I passed through the same places where he had once passed. Another era, a different environment, a different individuality, partly even his warning example, and most importantly - other, many times more powerful forces, saved me from repeating some of his mistakes. I had already met him in transphysical spaces many years ago, but I lost the memory of it. It was only in 1949 that the atmosphere of imprisonment facilitated the invasion of impressions from new night travels with him into my daytime memory.

He showed me Agr. There is no sun or stars there, the sky is black like a dense vault, but some objects and buildings glow by themselves - all in one color, remotely resembling our crimson. I have already described this layer twice; the second time in the fourth part of this book; to describe this terrible landscape again seems unnecessary. It is important to note only that my guide showed me Agr for a reason: it was the layer where he had stayed for quite a long time after being lifted from Duggur. The Knight-Monk brought him liberation, and now everything that needed redemption has already been redeemed. His face, once scorched by the underground flame, is beginning to transform into an enlightened countenance. Over the past few years, he has already become a member of the Synclite of Russia.

## Book XI. On the Meta-History of the Last Century

### Chapter 1. The Ascension of the Third Zhrugr

Concluding the book on the meta-history of the St. Petersburg Empire, I compared two historical figures whose characters and appearances are so different that they are not commonly compared. However, their historical roles are not only comparable, but even in some ways, one version of the other: they have identical meanings, each for their own cycle of eras. Both of them marked the zenith of power of the Russian daimons, the entrance of these daimons onto the path of open struggle with the Demiurge, the bringing of the tyrannical tendency to the limit, and the beginning of the process of state destruction. These historical figures are Ivan IV and Nicholas I.

The immediate successors of Ivan the Terrible on the throne were two individuals: Feodor Ioannovich and Boris. One was a person of exceptional softness of heart, a gentle prayerful person, deprived not only of any significant intellect, but even of any substantial mental capacity; the other was the possessor of genuine statecraft, inspired by the desire to extricate the country from the impasse into which Ivan had led it, and firmly establish the nation's life on the coordination of the conflicting interests of various estates and groups of the population. It is possible to suggest that in the very fact of the existence of such a person as Feodor on the throne, Russia's meta-historical need to balance the image of the fearsome tsar with the image of a tsar who was gentle, merciful, and a fool was expressed; in Boris, the clear need of Russian statehood was expressed - to correct and heal the errors of Ioann, by eliminating all traces of the Oprichnina, ending the terror, easing the legislation, and strengthening international ties.

The immediate successor of Nicholas was Alexander II. He was naturally kind-hearted, compassionate, but unstable, though very stubborn, a man raised on the principles of absolutism, whose intellect did not shine with any bright virtues; however, to accuse Alexander of extreme limitation would be unfair. One can say that this person was something in between the well-meaning and pious but foolish Feodor, and the active statesman, the powerful Boris. At the same time, of course, Alexander remained far from the spirituality of the former, as well as from the far-sightedness and sobriety of the latter.

When a great tyrant departs from the Russian historical stage, who has ruled for thirty or forty years, heaped mountains of victims, brought the state to the brink of military catastrophe, and shattered in the eyes of the people the very concept of an anointed one, a popular leader and father, the following inevitably occurs. His successors try to fix things through limited reforms, trying to show that the reign of terror was only a historical accident, and that now power will be entirely inspired by the ideas of the common good. In this process, the new rulers, fatally bound by the chains of political continuity and unable to detach themselves from the fundamentals of the old state concept, are incapable of understanding to what extent tyranny and terror have discredited in the eyes of the people this very concept, with all its ideals. Partial distancing from the words and deeds of the deceased despot seems sufficient to them for the people to forgive the authorities and their representatives for the just-passed bloody, ugly, and senseless stage. However, very soon it becomes evident that the people have not forgotten, have not forgiven, and have no intention of forgiving; that they are only quiet for a while, as the police system, improved by the despot, continues to exist, albeit in a weakened form, and as the atmosphere of not only political but also cultural and spiritual autocracy, which has reigned for so many years, has petrified the psychological soil without which the shoots of new ideologies cannot emerge. Nevertheless, from year to year, signs begin to multiply that the people dream of changing the structure of power at its very foundations because under the old structure, they do not feel safe from possible recurrences, and also because the feeling of deepest resentment, merging with the feeling of bitterness and calling for justice, cannot be satisfied with the handouts that are now being thrown to the people as rewards for several decades of arbitrary rule and bloodshed.

This is one of the laws of Russian history, a law in the sense that this word can be applied to historical phenomena that have already been repeated three times.

Of course, in each new case, this law, manifested in a new social, cultural, and international context, subordinates the concrete historical material of the new era to itself, and as a result, before us is a kind of new variation of an old theme, complicated by the specifics of the new time. It is essential to distinguish the essence of this law from the historical contingencies that surround it. For example, it is not significant that in the end of Boris's reign, Poland's witzraor intervened in the internal Russian strife, and nothing similar happened at the end of Alexander II's reign; or that Boris died - or took his own life - in connection with the appearance of a pretender, while Alexander was killed by fighters against autocracy and avengers for the people. What is important is that both of these figures represented a desperate attempt by the demon of great-power statehood to correct the mistakes and crimes committed through a system of softening reforms. Both could not stay on this course because it opened up too wide a floodgate of popular discontent. Both wavered in their state affairs, sometimes leaning to the right, sometimes to the left. Both took a step forward, then a step back, and both ultimately suffered what everyone who tries to sit between two chairs goes through.

The root of failure lay in the fact that in both cases, witzraors acted without the sanction of the demiurge, for this sanction was already lifted from them earlier. In the second case, an even more tragic process began: the demiurge entered into open struggle with witzraor. From this point of view, metahistory should consider all the events of Russian statehood and culture throughout the reigns of Nicholas I, Alexander II, and Alexander III: the fierce struggle of the militant state principle against the principle of cultural creation; the death of Pushkin and Lermontov, the suffocation of literature, the paralysis of critical thought, the domination of bureaucracy and the military, the weakening of international relations, the growing fear of the Russian colossus in Western countries, the Crimean War, the defeat, the forced change of course, the abolition of serfdom, attempts at various reforms, increasing outbreaks of revolutionary passions, populism, terror from below, the murder of the Tsar, panic in the upper circles of society, the next retreat, the reaction under Alexander III, and the looming of a new revolutionary situation.

The situation was extremely complicated by the fact that the Demiurge Yarosvet and the Second Zhrugtr were not the only participants in the struggle: the offspring of Zhrugr - predatory and greedy offspring that periodically sprouted from him - also interfered in it. Previously, Zhrugr had managed to destroy the first two that had attacked him when he didn't have to defend himself against the forces of Yarosvet. The movements of Razin and Pugachev were drowned in rivers of blood. However, the third Zhrugrite was weak and not active enough: he could not even promote his human weapon - the leader of the new movement - nor could he involve the masses. The defeat of the Decembrist movement did not require great sacrifices. But soon after the death of Nicholas I, when Witzraor, who had been exerting his strength in the struggle against the Demiurge for so long, needed a respite, and the historical state power, which had been fighting against spirituality for thirty years, with the winds of beauty, freedom, and genius in art and public thought, needed to find some modus vivendi with this force - it was precisely at this moment that a new Zhrugrite sprouted: brown, very energetic, with dull black eyes and a malicious, highly intellectual face. Like a predatory killer whale circling around a cumbersome whale, he revolved around his exhausted, aging parent. He demanded food from the Igva, and his pressure was so swift that many of the inhabitants of Drukkarg, not daring to disobey, began to provide him with nourishing dew instead of the old Zhrugr. Soon his sharp, shrill voice, mocking and insolent, reached the surface of the earth and, through the consciousness of several dozen people who possessed the spirit of the age, the agility of thought, the will to social action, and the skill of the pen, it began to transform into a small stockpile of new ideas, sometimes preached brilliantly, sometimes not, but always with great temperament, immense enthusiasm, and self-confidence, and mostly with a sharp, mocking, cynical tone. The 1960s began.

From words to action, from propaganda to revolutionary terror, there was only one step. It was taken very quickly, and the old Zhrugtr shook with pain and fury when his offspring tore off one of his main tentacles, and the conduits of this offspring's will in Enrof were killed right on the imperial street in St. Petersburg - an unstable, weak, too soft, but still the instrument of the Second Zhrugtr.

And what about Yarosvet? Having removed his sanction from the second Witzraor, could he overshadow it with a new creation? What would the domination of this Zhrugr entail in Drukkarg? What new form of government would this creature create in Enrof, whose first steps were stained with blood and whose narrow Witzraorial mind from the very beginning refused to accommodate any kind of Demiurge invocation? What was the reason for helping this creature take his father's place - a father who was already threatening to bring waves of revolutionary unrest to the country? Therefore, it cannot seem strange that in 1881, the Demiurge, who had been fighting with the old Zhrugr up to that point, temporarily put down his weapons: he gave the old man the opportunity to concentrate his forces on the fight against his creation. These forces proved to be enough to bring the Zhrugr to a state of prolonged exhaustion.

But Zhrutr could not become wiser than himself. Long ago struck by ideological infertility, he still could not take advantage of the respite given to him to create a new concept of power, a new philosophy, new ideals. Only autocracy, orthodoxy, and nationality - all three components in the most reduced, soulless sense - were all that could be squeezed out of Alexander III's government.

But the older the Witzraor, the more often its offspring sprout from it. In the 80s, for the first time, the Igvas saw how in the absence of the old Zhrugr, a new creation quietly crept into Drukkarg and silently seized the nutritious dew: dark red in color, with an unusually long neck and an incredible number of suction cups. It still did not dare to attack its father; it preferred to disguise itself and hide until it gained strength. Soon a third one appeared: pale, very thin, but with a huge mouth. What was the purpose of the mouth of a creature that fed with suction cups and whose speech would have been sufficient with a tubular mouth, like all Zhrugrs? Obviously, the mouth of this monster appeared in advance, for the satisfaction of some future needs. For now, he was only able to quietly grumble, as if complaining about his father, and methodically, soberly prove to the Great Igvas that he could handle tasks much more successfully than the old man.

I understand how offensive it is for generations raised on the ideals of revolutionary struggle and seeing in the events of 1905 the selfless heroism of the masses and their leaders on the one hand, and the bloody tyranny of the authorities on the other, to accept the idea that behind this magnificent epic lies the gnawing of abhorrent monsters of metahistory among themselves - so abhorrent that the sanction of the demiurge could not shine on any of them. But the fact of the existence of witzraors and their struggle in no way diminishes either the spiritual beauty of revolutionary heroism or the justification of the subjective motives that drove the most idealistic and pure fighters for the liberation of the people, nor, finally, the vile cruelty of their executioners. But it is time to realize that behind the historical events, the scale of which blinds us and makes us poeticize them, there was still a struggle of metahistorical monsters: that is why these historical epics are so bloody and their specific positive result is so questionable. After all, the struggle of monsters is behind world wars, and it is good at least that we are no longer inclined to poeticize these wars. With time, poeticizing revolutions will also come to an end.

But it is also true that the mutual struggle of only the hierarchies of metaculture does not exhaust or explain metahistory in general and the metahistorical drama of Russia in the twentieth century in particular. It is precisely in the twentieth century, and especially in the grandiose events that became the arena of Russia, that the influence of planetary principles is manifested - a complex interweaving and collision of inspirations emanating from centers of much greater scale and pursuing much broader goals.

As is well known, in the mid-19th century, a universal doctrine emerged in Western Europe that would rise to dominate one-third of the globe over the next hundred years. Its first victory, of truly global significance, took place in Russia, which was thus propelled to a position of leadership that made it the driver of nearly half of humanity and a key participant in the most horrific military conflicts to ever shake the surface of our planet. There is no place here to delve into the meta-historical-philosophical analysis of this doctrine: such an analysis could serve as the subject of a separate monumental work. But it is absolutely necessary to draw attention to the internal contradictions of this doctrine, to the rift between its ideals and its methods. Its economic side, deeply rooted in theory and morally justified, suffered serious distortions precisely because of this rift, as soon as the possibility of its practical implementation arose. The philosophical doctrine, built upon this economic program, was spawned by minds suffering from all the limitations of the 19th century. The voices of this militant-rationalistic mentality, inherited from the Encyclopedists and reinforced in connection with the rapid successes of the natural sciences, raised some of the tenets of contemporary materialism to the level of testament, of cornerstone dogma, without ever suspecting that those same natural sciences would begin to undermine the foundations of this very dogma in a hundred years' time. One of the mechanisms of transmission between the nation-building hierarchies and historical reality – economics – was proclaimed the supreme executor of historical destinies. Was this lie a conscious one? Apparently not, although the founder of the doctrine came to realize by the end of his life, it seems, that this mechanism was being driven by someone. But this new understanding would have required such a significant upheaval of the entire edifice for its inclusion in the doctrine that the founder preferred to remain silent about his discovery. Moreover, as far as I know, there are no hints of this discovery in the documents that belong to him, and my report of it is based on the same sources as are all of my reports, which cannot be scientifically verified.

It is clear that the positive ideals of this doctrine, which largely coincide with the dreams of the highest human hearts, were not and could not have been inspired by the forces of Gagtungar. Their roots go back to the opposite of the planetary demon, a series of universal ideas that include many manifestations of Christian spirituality. But, caught between the rollers of an energetic, tireless, and proud, narrow and limited mind, they were flattened, compressed, and constricted. In the end, the ideals lost their spirituality, and the proclaimed methods were sharply at odds with the requirements of basic humanity.

Perhaps the damage to spirituality was most vividly expressed in the assertion that the only way to realize these ideals in life is through armed struggle, violent seizure of power, ruthless destruction of enemies, and dictatorship of one class - or rather, its organized part - over all other population groups. Thus, the struggle between the demonic and providential unfolded within this doctrine, between its ideals and methods, even in the mind and soul of its founder, and later - between its various interpreters and followers.

Moreover, this struggle continued in the consciousness of the person who became the leader of this movement in Russia at the turn of the twentieth century. The dream of the happiness of humanity and a burning faith that the road to this happiness is completely clear to him burned brightly in his soul. Narrow, selfish ambition was foreign to him: he thirsted for power not for himself, but for the good of the majority, for the good whose secret he felt he had grasped more clearly and unerringly than anyone else. He even knew moments of reverie in nature or the beauty of art, which he then explained to his class half-heartedly in moments of self-chastisement. But the mad frenzy did not allow him to look to the right or to the left. And the fact that he becomes an instrument of the crimson Zhrugr, and perhaps even of Urparp himself, only began to be revealed to him at the very end, in illness. There were moments of terrible breakthroughs, great anguish, and even prayer. But there was nowhere to retreat, and no one would have accepted his retreats at that time.

So, at the turn of the 20th century, the demiurge Yarosvet continued his simultaneous struggle against the old Zhrugr and all three of its offspring. However, this struggle aimed to restrain and control them, not to destroy their entire kind. Despite the opposition of Witzraor and his creations to the forces of Yarosvet and Synclite, they were still necessary. This was the tragedy. Russia was not protected by any oceans or mountain ranges from the powerful states that had formed in the West. Their aggressive Witzraors only waited for the weakening of the old Zhrugr to attack and throw their own, fully militarized state against the weakened Russian government in Enrof. In these conditions, the complete weakening of the Zhrugr kind by the forces of Light would not only open the gates of Drukkarg to foreign invaders but also voluntarily strip Russia of the armor that alone provided for its physical existence. Therefore, the question of the destruction of the entire Zhrugr kind still could not be raised. Even the preference for any of the Zhrugrits could not be raised. Even the weakest of them, with one look from its jaws, could dispel any doubts about its metahistorical potential. Only its projection in history, disguised as liberal and benevolent "opposition to his majesty," could mislead those whose vision is unable to penetrate beyond the realm of politics and society and who are powerless to understand that behind the demagogic programs of parties like the Cadets lurks the militant spirit of national imperialism, the spirit of colonialism, the bourgeois spirit of insatiable greed, self-righteous common sense, and vulgarity.

Even greater concern could be caused by the still quiet Zhrugrit - the Crimson one. Hiding behind the backs of his brothers, he only occasionally attacked his father with short bursts, then retreated and quietly consumed the nourishing dew while the old man and two other offspring fought, entwining themselves with all their tentacles. His face was terrible but not devoid of satanic majesty. The head on the long neck was proudly thrown back, and in the dark eyes, half-covered by stern eyelids resembling overturned semicircles, orange dots swarmed, giving them an expression of rapidly developing thought and superhuman cunning.

Naturally, the historical projection of this Zhrugrit was enriched with the most ideological charge. Only it and no other were armed with a broad, all-encompassing doctrine, a universal program, and an understanding of the historical moment. And it was only the Crimson Zhrugrit that had already created an excellent human-machine: a creature with a heavy and tireless brain and a ram-like forehead, with a wide and greedy, infantilely swollen mouth and cunning, Tatar-like wild and ruthless eyes.

I am infinitely far from considering the question of moral responsibility of individual states for the First World War here. To some extent, all great powers are responsible: some as aggressors, others as provocateurs. But if I were asked which of the witzraors first attacked its neighbor and which of the races of anti-humanity first invaded a foreign shrastr, I would have to say that it was the witzraor of Germany, driven mad by the swiftness of its own growth, greed, and envy, losing its sense of perspective and ability to compare things soberly in both its own and our world. But this was precisely what Gagtungr had in mind. His plan was for the Great Igva of Germany to imagine itself destined for supremacy over all shrastrams, even though this illusion cost countless lives and even his own destruction. This plan included a world war, as an unprecedented source of nourishment for gawakhs and as a way to create, on the ruins of some states, the embryo of a new social formation that could transform into the core of absolute global tyranny in the distant future. Did the demonic mind of Shadanakar already foresee this, whose ruins, precisely from the European empires, will become the foundation of this new formation, or did it become clear to him during the events? This ideology, which due to its internationalism, universality, scientific nature, accessibility, ethical decline, and harmony with the spirit of the times, was better suited for the tasks at hand, did not exist in Russia alone. And if the seizure of power failed in one country, it could succeed in another and, like a chain reaction, spread to neighboring states.

In any case, by unleashing the First World War, the witzraor and shrastr of Germany did their job.

When the enemy, whose rage was quadrupled because he had to fight on two fronts, invaded Zhrugr and squeezed the body of the old Zhrugr in an iron embrace, even the brown and pale Zhrugrites rushed to their father's aid. They realized that the existence of the Zhrugr citadel was at stake and that if the foreign enemy captured this citadel, the end of the entire Russian witzraor lineage would come in the underground world, and the end of the Russian great power in Enrof. Only the crimson Zhrugrite was more excited: a change of Great Igvs had occurred in Drukkarg, and the new one, strongly inspired by Gagtungr, revealed to the crimson Zhrugrite such prospects in the event of the old Zhrugr's death that could make one's head spin.

And Zhrugr was dying. In the face of the enormous power of the German Witzraor, the aid of the pale and brown was rendered insignificant, like the aid of children to an adult soldier in a tank battle. Then they ran aside to seize the moment of their father's agony, to sink their teeth into his body and eat his heart, an act which, once accomplished, makes the devourer the successor of the deceased. The complete inability of the old demon of the great power to protect Russia was realized by Yarosvet himself, and his angry blow fell upon the citadel of Drukkarg. Its blocks cracked and fell apart, and this moment became great and stunning for the entire Russian people. The imperial state itself cracked and fell apart, and through the breach formed, millions of human souls saw the blue radiance of Navna with spiritual vision. They saw the proximity of that which liberation will be the pledge of the realization of the meta-historical mission of the Russian people, by way of universal brotherhood. Their consciousnesses could not contain this radiant vision, but for several great days, the entire atmosphere of their existence was filled with indescribable joy and intoxicating faith. It was faith in the fulfillment of an age-old dream, in the advent of universal happiness. Those were unforgettable days on the cusp of February and March 1917, when the sacred intoxication of bloodless revolution flooded St. Petersburg and Moscow, rolling from heart to heart, from house to house, throughout the country, throughout the excited, jubilant provinces. Even the most balanced minds believed for a moment that Russia had entered an era of universal brotherhood, leaving behind all evil and pointing the way to global harmony for all peoples. The vision faded, the citadel stood, reason still did not understand anything that had happened, but the memory of the breathtaking moment of some kind of universal premonition, of some kind of anticipation of universal brotherhood, remained in many human souls. Distorted by reasoning, clouded by the influence of the flaring Zhrugrits, captured by their own interests in one or another political theory, the memory of this significant insight continued to live in the feelings of individuals—it had to live, it could not fail to live, it was destined to pass from generation to generation.

At this moment, the crimson zhrugrite could not resist the urge to sink its teeth into the writhing torso of its father. The rusty dome of the crown was torn from the unfortunate one's head. The local roar and ringing echoed throughout the plateaus and cities of Drukkarga as the centuries-old emblem, the magical crystal of domination, struck the peaks of the mountains aimed towards the center of the earth. Jumping from peak to peak, it shattered into thousands of fragments. Military orchestras in the cities of Enrof thundered the triumphant revolutionary anthem, and echoes of either the ringing of the broken emblem or the festive noise of the musical instruments of the frenzied igva, resounded through their litavs. The old Zhrugr had long bored them with his old age, infertility, lack of initiative, stupidity, and inability to realize the global designs increasingly imprinted in the mind of the great igva by Gagtungr.

But the old Zhrugr was still alive. Dragging the crimson zhrugrite inside him, which burrowed deeper and deeper towards his heart, he crawled with his last strength to the central temple. He hoped that by coinciding with the outlines of his body, he would trigger in the igvas an explosion of the enthusiasm that had always inflamed them in such solemn moments. And here, right above the streets of Drukkarga, the last zhrugrite was born from the dying one - black, small, perhaps the most vicious of them all. Barely born, he began to bite into his parent's body, and the brown one, trying to make up for the time lost in confusion, rushed after the crimson one, vainly trying to outpace it on the path to the parental heart.

Then the ancient Velga of Russia, awakening from her sleep in Gashsharve, the great multiplier of sacrifices and sufferings, felt that her hour had come again. She descended into Drukkarga, barely visible to the igvas, like the glow of purple and black coverings, but with the semblance of a sharp-headed mask, without any openings. She enveloped the black underdeveloped zhrugrite with her cover and infused him with the excess of her strength. Anarchy began in Drukkarga and Enrof - their joint involvement.

In Enrof, late autumn raged. Freezing rains lashed the streets and palaces of St. Petersburg when the crimson zhrugr was the first to reach his father's heart and tear it from his body in Drukkarg. It was the moment when the guns of a cruiser fell silent from the walls of the Winter Palace, overlooking the Neva; and in the deep underground world, the victorious crimson zhrugr, inside the main temple of the Igvs, high under the cone, held the pulsating heart to his chest, drinking its blood with his suckers, drop by drop. Other zhrugrs, mad with envy and hatred, withdrew into the distance, except for the black one writhing there; all of them tried to rearm themselves, concentrating troops of igvs and raruggs around them; but the crimson zhrugr kept drinking - drop by drop. The German witzraor, bitten from behind by other enemies but still mighty, dragging a host of other anti-human races behind him, also fought his way towards the great temple, having already taken a quarter of the underground country; but the crimson zhrugr kept drinking. And Drukkarg and Enrof began to descend into chaos, and he kept drinking. His human machinery took over the Kremlin and fortified itself there, and he kept drinking. And only when several shots rang out one after another in the basements of Yekaterinburg, and the last of the human machinery of the old Zhrugr paid the price for the sins of three centuries, did it become clear that the victorious one had finally released the empty, drained heart from his suckers and, with the same suckers, placed a golden cube on himself, in the form of a crown. He became the Third Witzraor of Russia.

Is it necessary after this to dwell in detail on the meta-historical meaning of the civil war? To indicate which zhrugr leaders led which movements with their human machinery? All of this is clear without explanation, and it is not essential or important from the point of view of the world's future.

Of what is important is that the struggle between the demonic and providential began to continue within that historical movement, within that psychology which became dominant by the end of the civil war and remained so for several decades. When analyzing these phenomena, it is never possible to forget that the seed of this ideology and all of this movement, the ideal of a perfect social order, was sown in the historical field by the same forces that once made the ideals of universal brotherhood, equality of all people before God, and the right to freedom for each living person clear to the minds and hearts of distant past generations. In humanity, which did not receive the opportunity to implement this due to the truncated mission of Christ, these ideals inevitably had to gradually lose their spiritual essence, become reduced and hollowed out, and practice had to abandon the too slow and centuries-discredited principle of Christian self-improvement and come to replace it with the principle of external violence. Thus, the demonic element distorted the ideal and flooded the road with blood. This is what we see in the panoramas of the civil war and in the stages of history that followed. However, this did not mean that the demonic element completely captured and controlled both this movement and the psyche of the people who joined it. No matter how much their ethical practice was reduced, and no matter how hostile their enslaved materialistic doctrine became to any spirituality, human soul movements that stemmed from the unconscious or superconscious sphere continued to be often elevated, pure, and worthy. Hence arose the feeling of comradeship, the thirst for knowledge, heroism, and self-sacrifice, all the more valuable because the one sacrificing their life for the good of future humanity did not count on reward in the afterlife.

From a metahistorical point of view, there is another important aspect to the events of the first years of the revolution. It is important that the new Lineager, barely having placed the golden cube upon himself and even before that, already possessed tentacles of such incredible length that, even when compressed by enemies in the narrow space of Central Russia, he could still reach far beyond the backs of his enemies, into their own shrastras. It is important that these tentacles were still too thin and weak to squeeze the Witzraors of other metacultures in a deadly embrace, but they were long and numerous enough to shake the foundations of foreign citadels and deploy thousands of human machines in Enrof. It was important that the possibility of a world revolution and transition to world tyranny became the most pressing threat of the day, and that the demiurge and Synclite of Russia, having drawn an unbreakable circle of light around the new Russian Lineager, sealed him off with a wall of providential forces, preventing or at least delaying this threat.

The plan of Gagtungr was not realized, but it was not overturned either. The new social formation that he invented and shaped in Enrof as a step towards universal tyranny was not embodied on a global scale. But the space for the first nucleus of this formation, for its fortress, for its model, for the future foothold for the capture of other metacultures was torn, fortified, and enclosed. Now it was necessary to create this very formation on this space, which had never existed anywhere but was envisioned by the bright geniuses and righteous men of humanity, distorted and soulless by the impulse of Gagtungr's strong minds and one dark messenger of the previous century, and now led by the great human machine of the Third Zhrugr.

### Chapter 2. The Struggle with Spirituality

There is a common belief that the material poverty of a society is reflected, directly or indirectly, in its spiritual poverty. Conversely, material abundance is expected to bring about spiritual richness.

However, objective historical observations do not confirm this thesis. Until the late phase of capitalism, wealth was held by privileged classes or groups rather than society as a whole, and the differences existed not among the middle levels of these societies but among the material levels of the groups that composed them. The notion of material abundance can only be applied to society as a whole at a later stage of historical development. One can speak of abundance and wealth - at least during certain periods - in societies such as modern Sweden, Holland in the last century, and Switzerland. The United States can also be described as wealthy, although with some significant qualifications, as the difference in material levels among different population groups in this country is very significant, and not all of society was covered by the so-called prosperity even in its best times. As for countries of the socialist camp, I do not mention them here because these formations belong to an even later historical period.

I would be very interested if someone could convincingly show me that the societies that have achieved a high level of material prosperity, such as Sweden, the Netherlands, and Switzerland, also exhibit genuine spiritual wealth. It is true that they have contributed and continue to contribute something to world science and technology, but science, like technology, belongs mainly to the realm of intellectual, not spiritual, values. From the very beginning, one must learn to distinguish between these two types of phenomena. The mentality of a certain type, which is quite common today, does not distinguish between the spiritual and the intellectual. The humanities, art, society, ethics, religion, physical-mathematical and biological sciences, and even some aspects of technology are all lumped together. The creativity of Kalidasa and Darwin, Hegel and Edison, Ramakrishna and Alekhine, Stalin and Gandhi, Dante and Pavlov is considered an aspect of the same field - "spiritual" culture. This aberration could be called savage if it were not for the fact that highly intelligent civilized people are responsible for it. And yet it is as clear as day that here we have two completely different types of phenomena: spiritual and intellectual.

Almost the entire field of science, and even more so technology, belongs to the second category; it also includes philosophical, aesthetic, and moral constructions to the extent that they are freed from representations and experiences of the supernatural, immaterial, otherworldly, spiritual in the precise sense of the word. It also includes social movements, political programs, economic and social activities, even art and literature. The spiritual category consists of human manifestations that are connected precisely with the concept of the multilayered nature of being and the sense of the various threads that connect the physical plane of life with the otherworldly and spiritual planes. This includes the areas of religion, spiritualistic philosophy, meta-history, high ethics magic, and the deepest works of literature, music, and spatial arts.

If one understands and internalizes the difference between two types of phenomena, spiritual and intellectual, then it becomes clear that spiritual wealth is not directly dependent on material wealth. Only two extreme degrees of material prosperity have a negative impact on spiritual activities: poverty and extravagance. The former forces one to expend all their energy on the struggle for survival, while the latter leads to the pursuit of multiplying wealth or to satiety, depletion, and the draining of the psyche with spiritual fat.

Not Sweden, not Holland, not the United States, but poor Thailand, semi-civilized (from the perspective of Europeans) Ceylon, Burma and Cambodia, "semi-savage" Tibet and Nepal, and semi-impoverished India, are examples of societies whose lives are much more imbued with artistry, everyday participation of the masses in the creation of highly aesthetic values, intensive ideological quests, and the kind of emotional warmth that can only be found in countries where a moral climate created by vast reservoirs of spirituality has prevailed for centuries. We are accustomed to focusing our attention on the economic backwardness of these countries, on Indian poverty, Tibetan illiteracy, the primitiveness of Ceylonese life, the vestiges of the caste system in India, the theocratic feudalism of Tibet, and the imperfections of family life. And we deliberately close our eyes to the other side of the life of these countries: the side whose efforts created and sustained cities that were half temples of breathtaking beauty and enlightenment, whose genius gave rise to the wonderful architecture that adorns the face of the earth, and whose sacred rivers flow between banks crowned with innumerable monuments to human striving for spirit, light, and beauty. We forget the side of Indian life without which no people could free themselves from centuries of enslavement by nonviolent means - the most ethically pure methods ever devised. It is not intellectualism, but spirituality that permeates all manifestations of the life of the Indian and Indomalayan metaculture: from the internally radiant masterpieces of crafts to folk art, from the "mass man's" attitude towards problems of life and death, to mysteries and heroic epics that are presented all night long in any miserable square in even the most remote village, and from the striking non-maliciousness towards recent oppressors, to the relatively low percentage of criminal offenses, especially compared to America and Russia, and to high-moral action programs adopted by the ruling party, and even, for example, to the predominant types of women in Indian society, so vividly depicted by Rabindranath Tagore and Prem Chand.

The substitution of the concept of spirituality with that of intellect, while retaining the term "spiritual," is so widespread in Russia and even in the West that its meaning and purpose become perfectly clear. Its meaning and purpose lie in the same effort to shift human consciousness from the realm of higher values ​​to the realm of utilitarian values. This effort and its effective implementation constitute one of the main aspects of the cultural-historical process we are experiencing. It is certainly related to the decay of a distant social ideal, as I have already mentioned, and to the efforts to do this gradually and covertly so that society, gradually decaying and transforming, does not notice the vacuum that is forming, does not notice how the most valuable of values ​​are being taken away and replaced with others that are subordinate.

Material well-being is an unconditional value in and of itself. It is a natural and worthy level of human external existence. It represents value because it is that very armor of external well-being that allows one to mature calmly and bear fruit for the seeds of the soul. But to proclaim material wealth and the external conquest of nature for the sake of material abundance of humanity as the fundamental and highest value, the goal of organized mass struggle around the world, the ideal of social development for the sake of which entire generations and everything related to the spiritual realm of values ​​must be sacrificed - this is either a tragic mistake or a semi-conscious deception.

However, it is precisely this false idea, sometimes proclaimed loudly, sometimes left unsaid, but always present in the complex of revolutionary ideas of our era, that determines both the character of the ideals that crown this complex and the methodology adopted by it.

For brevity, we will refer to the comprehensive social, political, and philosophical doctrine that was developed in the middle of the last century in the West, and gradually became the hegemon of advanced, revolutionary thinking, as the Doctrine.

It is easy to imagine that this Doctrine, genetically linked to previous links of Western philosophical and scientific thought, even to Christianity, was developed with the active assistance of those forces that are concerned with creating a powerful doctrine that should become the leading one in humanity, but leading up the ideological and social substitutions ladder to such a state of social, cultural, psychological, and technical development where there is only one short leap left to absolute individual tyranny.

If we accept such a premise, the spotlight under which we have become accustomed to contemplating the phenomena of culture and history will suddenly shift; phenomena that previously seemed so distinct to us will be plunged into shadow, while, conversely, new phenomena will emerge from the darkness that we either did not suspect or did not pay attention to before.

The ironclad, stubborn, literally foaming-at-the-mouth defense of materialism, unwilling to yield an inch; the burning, almost insane hatred of everything that can be suspected of religiosity, mysticism, or idealism; the complete exclusion of spiritual values, equating them with relics of antiquity and affirming only material and intellectual values; the placement of the idea of material abundance for the majority at the forefront; the blessing of any means that contribute to achieving this goal; the proclamation of the dictatorship of the proletariat, then the substitution of the proletariat with a single party, and later the substitution of the party with the figure of a single leader; the declaration of the harsh necessity of subordinating all other classes of society, and then the physical destruction of obstructing classes; the strict control of the state, that is, the one-party dictatorship, over all the ideological and cultural production of society; the colossal role assigned to technology, machines, industry, automation - automation of production processes, social relations, and even the psyche itself - all of this and much more takes on a new and rather ominous meaning from a new perspective.

It is highly symptomatic that the very Doctrine that made its way to the public surface through liberating slogans and tirades about freedom began the era of its dominion with the dispersal of a nationwide assembly of representatives, in the selection of which it had participated itself, hoping in vain to obtain a majority. This was immediately followed by a ban on the activities of all other parties and political organizations and the destruction of all printing organs, except for its own.

From the perspective of the metahistory outlined here, it is important to consider such phenomena as science, technology, and industrialization.

In the human being - not only in their physical body but in the complex conglomerate of their being made up of different materials - there are potentials that, if developed, would vastly expand our ability to use material environments and completely change the relationship between humans and space, humans and time, humans and nature, and humans and other layers of existence.

The problem of flight can be solved not only through aviation. The fight against diseases to extend normal lifespans can be pursued through methods different from those used by medicine. Rapid movement through space and communication over vast distances are not monopolies of sciences related to improving transportation and communication. Abilities such as flight, for example, the ability to overcome space with incredible speed, to communicate over long distances, to pass through dense environments, to overcome diseases, to extend human life spans by two to three times, to meet creatures from other layers, to contemplate trans-physical panoramas, to replenish life forces not through food but through the absorption of the radiation of light elementals and the inhalation of fragrances - all these abilities, like many others, lie in embryonic form deep within our being. Technical achievements of our day, such as jet planes, televisions, or cybernetic devices, would seem gross, laughably cumbersome, vulgar, heavy, primitive, abhorrently soulless, and even, strangely enough, irrational to anyone capable of foreseeing humans who have acquired the ability to fly like angels, to have spiritual vision, or to perform instantaneous, complex mental operations solely through the development of the abilities dormant in our brain, in our physical, etheric, and astral bodies. Spirituality and the wise beauty of bird wings are not so far from the lifeless gleam of a worn-out airplane wing, as the concrete results of moving along these two contrasting paths of human development are far apart. The magic of antiquity and, later, some directions in Eastern philosophical practice barely touched on the question of unleashing these potentials. The path to such revelation is almost unexplored, extremely laborious, and bears fruit only as a result of the successive work of many generations. Its particular difficulty lies in the fact that such a practice is closely linked to the overall spiritualization of the individual, to the rise of their moral level, and to the purification from all kinds of impurities. Ancient magic could not go far along this path precisely because of the underestimation of the connection between magical practice and ethics. Subordinating this activity to selfish motives leads, in most cases, to a cessation of movement, and sometimes - to the continuation of movement, but at the cost of demonizing the shelt with all the transcendent consequences that follow from it.

In the later cultural and historical stages, many movements and schools touched upon this issue within highly developed religions, such as Pythagoreanism, Kabbalah, Eastern Christian monasticism, Taoist and Lamaist monasticism. Indian yogis seemed to consciously pursue the development of these potentials within themselves more than any other group. They were already fully aware of the connection between this work and personal ethics. However, the yogi's required renunciation of many human needs and strict self-discipline hindered the inclusion of large masses into this movement. It is highly doubtful, however, that extreme asceticism is truly necessary to unlock these potentials, regardless of the era and culture. The conditions of the new era would probably dictate not torturous bodily mortification, such as that of the monks of Isaac of Syria's time or Indian hermits, but rather more relaxed conditions, similar to the concept of worldly righteousness or, for example, the daily routine of South Buddhist communities: strict and pure, but rejecting bodily mortification.

In ancient metacultures, including Byzantium, society had not yet made a final choice between this path of development and another - the one that could be briefly referred to as scientific and technical. However, in the panorama of the ancient Roman Empire, signs can be seen that in terms of ancient public consciousness, almost nothing remained of the ideas of the first type of development; they became the property of esoteric and semi-esoteric societies, mystical cults, and some priestly circles. However, the social-economic conditions of ancient Rome, Byzantium, and even the Western Middle Ages could not yet promote the rapid advancement of society along the second path. The turning point is approximately the 15th century - the era from the invention of gunpowder and printing to the discovery of America, India, and the colossal economic and psychological shifts that followed.

Since the beginning of the 17th century, the predominance of the tendency towards the second path of development and the rapid decline of the potentials of the first path have become increasingly clear.

The second path of development is characterized by several features. Firstly, the connection between science, i.e., the understanding of the surrounding world, and any spirituality is sharply and completely severed. Spirituality is finally relegated to the realm of theology, cult, mystical philosophy, and art, that is, to the area that science pays no attention to until much later when studying it from its own scientific positions. Secondly, the methodology of knowledge is narrowed down to meticulous empiricism and purely rational generalizations of empirically obtained material. Thirdly, scientific activity as such is completely emancipated from any links to practical ethics: the selfishness or selflessness of the motives, the vice or virtue of the scientist, have no more relation to the productivity of his activities. Of course, karmic consequences of poorly directed scientific or technical activities, such as military invention, have to be reaped by everyone after death; but these consequences are far beyond the circle of his consciousness in life. And fourthly, science is made open to anyone with perseverance and diligence in principle. The final rupture between spiritual and intellectual ranks becomes an unshakable reality.

How to evaluate - from a meta-historical point of view - this choice of path made by Western humanity, and later determining the direction of intellectual activity in other meta-cultures? If the mission of Christ had not been interrupted, humanity would have received a mighty impetus to move precisely along the spiritual path. Then the methods would have been opened and assimilated, which would have allowed the involvement of the popular masses in this path instead of those units that are involved in it in India and in the countries of Buddhism; the achievements of these generations would have been incomparably greater and obvious to all. This is similar to the difference in the scope of scientific achievements in antiquity when only a few worked in this direction, and the scope of scientific achievements now, when millions are involved in this activity. He who ended the life of Christ in the very beginning continued his deeply determined, satanically reasonable activity in the future. And, of course, he contributed a lot to stifling all the escapes of spirituality and promoting the rapid growth of scientific and technical thought. It requires no explanation why he needed the first one; he needed the second because without the highest achievements of technology, the unification of humanity into a monolith would not be conceivable, and without this unification, the establishment of a world tyranny - the only tyranny worthy of the name absolute - would be impossible.

But the unification of humanity is a goal, rather a necessary stage on the path to the ultimate goal - not only for demonic entities. The unification of humanity is also a stage in achieving the ultimate goal for Providential entities. For as long as unification is not achieved, humanity will suffer from wars and revolutions - wars that are increasingly destructive. There will come a day when their destructiveness will become a threat to all organic life on the surface of the Earth. Without universal political and social unification, there are no ways to prevent this threat. And since humanity has long, though unconsciously, chosen the path of scientific and technological development, and it is impossible to change the general mentality towards spiritual path in a short time, Providential forces are forced to push humanity towards the scientific and technological path. This is the meta-historical dialectic. The forces of Light are only concerned with directing scientific thought, as it depends on them, along paths that are less threatening with fatal discoveries and inventions. The consciousness and will of scientists is the same battleground of Light and Darkness as everything in Shadanakar. And while the spiritualized minds of Einstein, Planck, Curie, who accomplished the feats of their grandiose discoveries, were enlightened and inspired by daimons, the minds of the inventors of six-barreled mortars, thermonuclear bombs, eavesdropping devices, and intercontinental missiles were directed in their efforts by invisible servants of our eternal Enemy.

But in addition to the multiplication of destructive forces of war, the development of technology had a primary and contradictory significance for humanity.

Of all other phenomena of the spiritual and intellectual range, even pure science, which is largely driven by the thirst for knowledge, technology differs in that it cannot help but be thoroughly utilitarian. The psyche of people who work with technology on a daily basis becomes accustomed to approaching everything in the world with the criterion of practical usefulness. If a person does not notice this danger themselves, if they do not separate with a deaf wall that sphere of their life and activity where technology reigns, from the other spheres of their life and soul, they become a spiritual cripple, a spiritual impotent, a spiritual blind man. There is no better way to extinguish in oneself glimpses of anything spiritual; there is no more reliable path to depriving the psyche of understanding of art, love for nature, attraction to religion, longing for world harmony, and thirst for love. In our zone, the development of technology is inevitable, inexorable, and justified because without it, neither the unification of humanity nor the establishment of that universal material level, which is worthy of humanity, is possible. But woe to those who allow technology to rule over their souls.

It is strictly logical, filled with iron historical logic, that the Doctrine appealed first and foremost to the proletariat, and it was precisely the proletariat that was predestined by it as the future hegemonic class. At that time, one could still deceive minds by appealing to a sense of justice and pity and crying out that the proletariat still creates only material values simply because it is powerless, oppressed, suppressed, poor, orphaned, and naked. Naive enthusiasts believed that, having freed themselves from exploitation and come to power, this class would create such higher values that would overshadow all the masterpieces of the past. And what happened?

Feudal aristocracy exploited the people, but the volume of cultural values created by this class is not subject to calculation or review. The priesthood and clergy, as is now known even to a newborn, exploited the darkness of the masses, but they created not only religious concepts and cults, they created eternal monuments of architecture, painting, poetry, music, philosophy, they created high moral precepts. The bourgeoisie is guilty of all mortal sins, but the cultural creativity of this class constitutes almost the greater part of what is now called cultural heritage. The peasantry remained at the bottom of the social ladder, but even they created songs and fairy tales, ornaments and legends, artistic crafts and folklore.

And what about the working class? I live in a country where the working class has remained the hegemon for the fifth decade. What has it created besides all the same material values and all kinds of technical and production improvements? Some might say, what about the entire working intelligentsia, that is, those who come from the working class and become engineers, economists, lawyers, scientists, and writers? But these are not the working class: they are those who have outgrown it, who have nothing left to do in this environment and who have been permanently separated from this environment by the nature of their activities, their circle of interests, and their material conditions of life. A monk who painted frescoes in a church remained a monk; a landowner who wrote novels, poems, and paintings in his estate or city home remained a landowner; a bourgeois who devoted his leisure time to art and science or patronage remained a bourgeois; and a peasant who composed epics or painted utensils remained a member of his class. But a worker who becomes an intellectual ceases to be a worker. And what this intelligentsia has created does not have to be taken into account when we talk about what this class has created as such.

In the strict sense of the word, there is no spiritual production of the working class; their intellectual output is negligible. The working class is not the crown of humanity, but its tragedy, its memento mori, a dire reminder that millions of people, potentially no different from the rest of society, are condemned by this society to spiritual degradation, to cultural degeneracy, only mitigated by the fact that these unfortunate individuals themselves do not understand the horror of their situation for the most part. Disconnected from mother earth and unrewarded for it with access to world culture, mentally maimed by eternal conflict with machines, aesthetically oscillating from the beauty of the industrial landscape to the vulgarity of popular prints, these people become victims of mind-numbing boredom as soon as they are left alone with themselves. They fear silence like fire because silence confronts them with their spiritual emptiness. Nature is dead to them, philosophy is deadly dull, art and literature are only accessible to them in their most debased forms, religion arouses only the arrogant mockery of ignorant people, and only science elicits a feeling of instinctive respect as something undeniably superior to them. Their leisure activities are cards, vodka, dominoes, sports, primitive flirting, and the cinema. And do not let them lie that I am slandering these people: they have been too long incensed with incense, softened by streams of demagogic flattery and lies; the time will come when their own unadorned portraits will be presented to them.

It is natural and logical that it is this human formation that the Doctrine has raised to a pedestal; it is precisely from it that the ranks of the autocratic party are created; it is precisely this that is elevated before humanity as supposedly the most valuable of human strata, as an example that all others should follow to the best of their ability.

The meaning of industrialization, one of the most important measures of the state in the 1920s and 1930s, is not limited to the fact that it increased the country's defense capability while slowly raising its material level. The meaning of industrialization also lies in the fact that it violently shattered the psychology of peasants and intellectuals, forcing Russia, as one foreign journalist put it, to "think with machines," and spreading the psychological regime that had previously been characteristic of the working class throughout society: a regime in which everything is assessed by practical usefulness, everyone feels like cogs in a giant machine and considers it normal; a regime in which art degenerates, literature becomes a state prostitute, religion dies, cultural heritage is degraded, and ethics are hollowed out: a psychological regime of spiritual emptiness. Cultural heritage remains the only channel through which spirituality still penetrates people's consciousness. And it is worth recalling that in the first years after the Great Revolution, when people still believed in the mirage of an imminent revolution throughout the world, there was a movement in Russian culture that demanded that all of the culture of the past be relegated to the archives. One of the ideologists of the Doctrine, Mayakovsky, only much later came to the conclusion that Pushkin did not write so badly; at first, like others, he demanded that Pushkin be thrown off the ship of modernity. Of course, Pushkin was understood as some kind of embodiment of classicism in general. The most talented theatrical figure of that era, Meyerhold, by turning classics inside out, cultivated that urbanistic, constructivist, openly schematic style that brings to mind the style of mass actions in Drukkarg. And even more striking was the reflection of the architectural style of Igv in the constructive style of those buildings that arose among Russian cities in the 1920s and early 1930s: devoid of any adornments, they were combinations of cubes, rhombuses, parallelepipeds - naked geometric shapes - with an obvious disregard for curved lines. It took reinforced envelopment from Zatomis to stop further hollowing out, or rather "Igvization", of architecture. However, the influence of the taste and style of anti-humanism in 20th century architecture was felt not only in Russia: constructivism in the West turned out to be even more stable than in our country, and it still disfigures beautiful cities in France, England, and Germany with its concrete monsters. There is nothing surprising about this: the envelopment of demonic elements is universal, and if in some periods of history Russia has become its main platform in humanity and the face of Drukkarg protrudes on its surface, then the rest of humanity has not been left without demonic attention, so that in case Russia breaks free, there will be a place and a means to continue building the foundation of the coming satanocracy. That is why the metaproimage of the Northwest meta-culture, Enrof, is increasingly shining through the cities of Western Europe and America now.

The strategic course taken by the state towards religion as a whole from the very beginning of the Revolution was deeply logical, of course. However, tactics had to be varied depending on the situation and the acuity of those who were leading this course at that particular time. The doctrine had not yet taken hold of power when the great man-made machine of the Third Zhrugr already declared that religion is the opium of the people. At first, in order to weaken the Orthodox Church, which had long dominated the minds of the broadest masses of the Russian people, especially the peasantry, attempts were made to shake the monolith of Orthodoxy by tolerating all kinds of sects. But it soon became clear that the church could not be shaken by such palliatives and that, on the contrary, the spirit of religious inquiry began to spread. Therefore, the sects were subjected to the same persecutions as the church. Their fate was shared by religious, philosophical, and mystical organizations and groups that existed among the intelligentsia: anthroposophical and theosophical lodges, occult circles, religious-philosophical society, and religious orders of any persuasion. The activity of anti-religious organizations, and first of all, the Society of "Godless", spilled over into clubs, lectures, stages, pulpits, print, theater, and cinema, even directly onto city and village squares. On church holidays, the churches were surrounded by crowds of young people who excelled in various kinds of blasphemy and humorous processions, in which Komsomol members portrayed pot-bellied priests with crooked miters and bottles in their hands; these buffoons moved along the streets parallel to the procession of believers. The lack of wit, aesthetic barrenness, and the imprint of insurmountable vulgarity that lay on these undertakings did little to contribute to their success. Stupidity had to be compensated for by three-fingered whistles, explosions of poorly rehearsed laughter, firecrackers, rockets, and often outright hooliganism.

Soon it became clear that these methods were powerless to distract a noticeable number of enthusiasts of spiritual opium from religion. On the contrary, the temples were so full as never before in the pre-revolutionary period. And when in 1925 the patriarch Tikhon, who was under house arrest, died, his funeral turned into such a million-person demonstration that it outshone all the mass expressions of grief inspired by the government and party, which had amazed Muscovites on the days of the funeral or, rather, mummification of the first leader a year earlier. After this, the tactic was changed, and the church was split from within. The successor to the late patriarch made a widely publicized statement that from now on, the joys of the godless state are our joys, its sorrows are our sorrows. Exceeding his powers, the highest hierarch of the Russian Church included the text of the great ektenia prayer about "the authorities that be" and their "every godly and pure habitation." It is very likely that the subjective motives guiding the highest hierarchy were reduced to the thought that it was better to save the church from complete physical destruction in this way, or to ensure the performance of its basic functions for the people: the sacraments of baptism, confession, and Eucharist. But in any case, this laid the foundation for the church's political course, which soon turned it into a powerless slave of the anti-religious government. Naturally, this turn caused a sharp division among the clergy and laity. Most priests either refused directly or avoided mentioning the authorities during worship. Saboteurs were punished, but not by the church. In its thousand years of existence, the Russian Church had only a dozen or so martyrs for the faith. Now this shortage was replenished abundantly. Thousands of priests and believing laity perished in prisons and labor camps. Temples were closed, destroyed, or converted into warehouses, workshops, or dormitories. The annihilating hurricane turned into rubble even those temples and monasteries that enjoyed world fame as unique art monuments. Bells, which for centuries rang waves of glad tidings over the cities and fields of Russia, rang for the last time and, dropped from shattered belfries, were sent as scrap metal for melting. By the mid-1930s, out of 600 active churches in Moscow, barely 40 survived, and in Kiev, for example, only one cathedral remained open. The fate of the Orthodox Church was shared by all other religions.

By that time, it had long been constructed, painted, and whitewashed what was supposed to replace the church as the leader of souls, as the teacher of life, as a mass organization. This quasi-church inherited from its predecessor its unwavering dogmatism, its combination of centralization with democratization, its system of harsh internal subordination, and its claims to be the only indicator of truth. They even tried to imitate the emotional warmth that is characteristic of the church. The ideological and structural unity of the party was protected by the same ruthless measures that the Christian church once used to protect its unity, entering into a fierce struggle with any heresy. And the exclusion of a member who had sinned from the bosom of the quasi-church became as terrible a punishment and was perceived by the unfortunate person as tragically as in the Middle Ages excommunication from the church was perceived.

Gradually, the quasi-church developed a quasi-cult. Instead of pitiful, makeshift anti-religious masquerades on church holidays, emphasis was now placed on organizing grandiose mass processions, parades, and pompous events on revolutionary holidays, on choral performances of party quasi-psalms and quasi-akathists, and on worshiping quasi-relics resting in the quasi-church by the walls of the Kremlin.

All means of economic and non-economic coercion were used to attract everything to the service of the quasi-church — from works of fiction to the circus, from the stages of leading theaters to restaurant stages. The centerpiece of this system was the so-called enlightenment, that is, the ladder of educational and scientific institutions from kindergartens to the Academy of Sciences of the USSR.

What kind of person was being raised by this all-encompassing pedagogical system? What was its ideal?

She developed courage in the subject, because such courage was necessary for the state to fight its enemies and for the upcoming battles for world domination. Willpower was nurtured, but the kind of willpower that was obedient to the state and quasi-church and resolute in carrying out their - and only their - directives. The sense of camaraderie was cultivated, but only in relation to those who steadfastly and firmly defended the cause of this state and quasi-church. Honesty and integrity were instilled, but a special kind of integrity: the kind where a person, without hesitation, would betray a comrade, friend, or father, and reveal any entrusted secret, if they contradicted even in details the interests of the state and the directives of the quasi-church. A creative attitude towards work was fostered - all for the sake of the efficiency of labor processes in the interests of the same quasi-church and state. The thirst for knowledge was encouraged, but it was directed along a strictly defined path: a path that ensured technical progress and the formation of a certain ideology. All of this was colored by carefully cultivated, grown, nurtured, watered, and heated hatred towards the enemy, and the enemy was anyone who thought differently than the quasi-church. As a result, a developed, energetic, joyful, purposeful, determined, and willful personality was created, which was, in its own way, honest, ideological, cruel to ruthlessness, spiritually narrow-minded, religiously ignorant, often mistaking baseness for valor, and inhumanity for courage and heroism. A complete type of self-confident fanatic was created, imagining that his state was the best of all states in the world, his people were more talented than all other peoples, his quasi-church was the ark of absolute truth, his ideology was flawless, his leader was infallible not only ex cathedra but also at every minute of his life, and everything else was rubbish, historical garbage, only hindering life and condemned to merciless destruction.

No matter how strong the positions taken by the Doctrine in the battle for human souls, within these souls there continued to flow an almost invisible struggle to outsiders, often an incomprehensible conflict to the very reason of the people, with those who tried to eradicate it, of a providential principle. In everyday life, in households, in friendships, in love, in the secret movements of the human heart, in the vague melancholy, in the insatiable doubts spontaneously arising from the depths of conscience, in communion with nature, in the streams of beauty pouring into the soul from the great creations of bygone times, the indomitable resistance of the spirit was felt.

Such stages were reached in the struggle with spirituality in the thirties of our century, when the colossal figure of a terrifying human creature, still predicted and foreseen from afar by the great prophets of Russia, loomed over one-sixth of the globe with final sharpness.

### Chapter 3. The Dark Shepherd

    A year will come, Russia's black year,
    When crowns of kings will fall down in fear;
    The people's love for them will be forgotten,
    And death and blood will be the food of many begotten;
    When children and innocent women,
    Lawless and unprotected will become victims of men;
    And famine will torment this poor land,
    While the waves of the rivers turn red with a fiery brand.

Thus begins a remarkable poem, written by the sixteen-year-old youth Lermontov in 1830. It is titled clearly: "Prediction".

    On that day, a powerful man will appear,
    And you will recognize him with fear;
    You'll understand why he carries a blade so sharp,
    And why your tears and cries will be lost in the dark.
    For him, your sorrow will be a mere joke,
    And darkness and terror will be his cloak;
    A black mantle with a feather bowed,
    Or, in another version, a high-crowned shroud.

And in both versions, the last line remains the only one testifying to the fact that not everything was equally visible to the poet through the mist of the coming centuries. "The leaning pen" is a tribute to youthful romanticism, a transfer of the props of past eras to the era of the future. "The black cloak" is an expression using a poetic image of that impenetrable darkness that will shroud this terrible figure, seen through the smoke and clouds of a whole century. As for the expression "exalted forehead," here it either characterizes the trait of Lermontov's Demon, transferred to a human being of almost supernatural power, deeply connected with the demonic principle, or perhaps it indicates that in this prophetic vision, two historical figures of the following century merged into one image before the poet's spiritual gaze, as if they were superimposed on each other in a temporal perspective, and Lermontov was unable to discern whether the high forehead would distinguish not the giant shrouded in darkness, but his predecessor.

    - Is everything calm among the people?
    - No. The Emperor is dead.
    Someone is speaking about new freedom
    On the squares.

This is a poem by Alexander Blok, written two years before the 1905 revolution.

    Is everyone ready to rise?
    No. They're turning to stone and waiting.
    Someone ordered them to wait:
    They wander and sing songs.
    Who is in power?
    The people do not want power.
    Civil passions are dormant:
    It can be heard that someone is approaching.

These concise and precise formulations convey the public atmosphere on the eve of the first revolution. But then something unexpected begins:

    Who is he, the people's subduer?
    Dark, and evil, and fierce:
    A monk at the entrance to the monastery
    Saw him - and was blinded.
    He drives people like herds
    To unfathomable depths...
    He drives them with an iron staff...
    Oh God! Let's run from the Judgment!

But it was too late to run. The appearance of this creature had been predetermined too long ago and prepared by too powerful forces of the infra-cosmos. In the Russian literature of the past century, there is yet another prediction about it, even more striking. Especially if we consider that it belongs to the pen of an author with metahistorical ideas and feelings of the distant past. It was not written in verse, but in prose, and its content is so profound that I will have to break the rule adopted in working on this book: not to abuse quotes. I am compelled to provide a whole chain of quotes, regretting only that the boundaries of the book do not allow me to include everything related to the precursor of this creature in one of the well-known works of Russian classical literature. I will start with a brief description of the imaginary portrait of this creature.

    "He is a man of medium height with a wooden face... His black hair covers his conical skull like resin and tightly frames his narrow forehead like a fur cap. His eyes... slightly swollen with a clear, unwavering gaze, his lips thin, pale, with trimmed mustaches; his jaws developed, but without any expression of carnivorousness, and with a certain bouquet of readiness to crush or bite in half without explanation. Dressed in military style surcoat, buttoned on all buttons."

You read it - and shudder. What is this? When and about whom was it written? - Written in the sixties of the last century. But why such an incredible coincidence with the appearance, too memorable not for the people of the sixties, but for our generation? - Let's read on.

    "On his face, there are no signs of questions; on the contrary, a certain soldierly composure is evident in every feature, indicating that all questions have long been resolved. What are those questions? How were they resolved? Perhaps it is a question of universal annihilation, or perhaps just a matter of all people having their chests protruding forward like a wheel? Nothing is known. What is known is that this unknown question will be put into action no matter what. And since such an unnatural attachment of the known to the unknown only confuses matters further, the consequence of this situation can only be one thing: universal panic."

    "Before the viewer's eyes rises the purest type of an idiot who has made some dark decision and sworn to carry it out... When idiocy is accompanied by authority, the task of protecting society becomes significantly more complicated."

    "Ugryum-Burcheyev(1) belonged to the most fanatical levelers. After drawing a straight line, he planned to cram the visible and invisible worlds into it with such an inexorable calculation that it would be impossible to turn back, forward, right or left. 'There is nothing more dangerous than a rogue's imagination, unrestrained by the reins and not threatened by the continuous reminder of the possibility of punishment on the body. Once aroused, it throws off all the yoke of reality and begins to paint its owner's projects in the most grandiose manner.' And 'Ugryum-Burcheyev was a rogue in every fiber of his being, in every thought. The virtuosity of linearity had settled like a willow stake in his mournful head, sending out an impenetrable network of roots and branches. It was a kind of mysterious forest full of magical dreams. Mysterious shadows followed one after the other in single file, fastened, clipped, with identical steps, in identical clothes, all walking, all walking... Even before arriving in Glupov, he had constructed a whole systematized delusion in his head, in which every detail of the future arrangement of this wretched municipality was regulated down to the last detail."

    "The next day, upon his arrival, he walked around the entire city... He walked for a long time, reaching out his hand and projecting, and only when his eyes beheld the river did he feel that something extraordinary had happened to him. He had forgotten... he had not anticipated anything like this... A radiant strip of liquid steel flashed before his eyes, and not only did it not disappear, but it did not even freeze under the gaze of this administrative basilisk."

    "Who's there?" he asked in horror.

    But the river continued to speak, and in this speech there was something tempting, almost ominous."

    "... At home, within a minute, he had already made a decision. Two equally great achievements lay before him: to destroy the city and to eliminate the river. The means for achieving the first achievement had already been considered in advance; the means for achieving the second were unclear and disjointed to him. But since there was no force in nature that could convince the scoundrel of ignorance of anything, in this case, ignorance was not only equivalent to knowledge, but was even stronger in a certain sense. He was neither a technologist nor an engineer; but he was a resolute scoundrel, and this was also a kind of power, possessing which one could conquer the world."

    "The city cowered; there was a stuffiness and a mustiness in the air. He had not yet given any orders, expressed any thoughts, or told anyone his plans, and yet everyone understood that the end had come."

------
(1): Shchedrin hardly suspected that this desire to fit everything into a straight line might reflect a memory of the atmosphere in one of the other layers, namely, on the one-dimensional Day of Shadanakar.

The End began, as everyone who has read Shchedrin knows, with the destruction of the old city down to its foundations and the clearing of all the resulting garbage, including manure, to the river.

    "And now the long-awaited moment had come. Summoning the hutkeepers, he led them to the riverbank, measured the distance with his steps, pointed with his eyes to the current, and said in a clear voice:

    - From here to here!

    As crowded as the townspeople were, they too felt the significance. Until now, only the works of human hands had been destroyed, but now it was time for the work of the eternal, the non-handmade...

    - Let it fly! - he commanded the hutkeepers, looking up at the swaying crowd.

    The struggle with nature had begun."

The struggle with nature! It is commonly believed that in the character of Ugryum-Burcheyev, Shchedrin reproduced - of course, in a satirical light - the character of Arakcheev. This is evidenced by certain external similarities between Shchedrin's hero and the repugnant timekeeper, as well as an obvious parody of the military settlements that made up the administrative and urban planning system dreamed up by Ugryum-Burcheyev. It is also clear that to some extent, this character reflects the real historical character of another despot who left an even more pronounced imprint on Russia and was chronologically closer to Shchedrin: the character of Nicholas I. But... the struggle with nature? Neither Arakcheev nor Nicholas destroyed cities to the ground in order to build new ones in their place, ranked by their foolish hierarchies; neither of them drove the entire population to a senseless and blind struggle with nature.

Finally, the mountains of garbage had dammed up the river.

    "A crack, a whistle, and some enormous bubbling sounds were heard... Then everything fell silent; the river stopped for a moment and quietly began to overflow onto the meadow side. By evening, the flood had grown so great that its boundaries were invisible, and the water kept rising and rising. A distant rumble could be heard; it seemed as if entire villages were collapsing and cries, moans, and curses were heard from there. Stacks of hay, logs, rafts, fragments of huts floated on the water and, reaching the dam, collected in one place."

It is known that Ugryum-Burcheyev's plans were ruined the following morning. During the night, the river had eroded and carried away the dam, and it was flowing again within its banks. Stunned, the transmuter decided to leave the river and build the dreamed city of Nepreklosk in a new place, on a flat as a table, plain. There, at last, he was overwhelmed, and he fell asleep with an axe in his hand.

    "Exhausted, insulted, and destroyed, the fools sighed freely for the first time after a long break. They looked at each other - and suddenly felt ashamed. They did not understand what had happened around them, but they felt that the air was filled with foul language and it was impossible to breathe further in this air. Did they have a history, were there moments in this history when they had the opportunity to assert their independence? - they remembered nothing. They only remembered that they had Urus-Kugush-Kildibaevs, Negodyaevs, Borodavkins, and, to top it all off, that horrible, infamous bastard! And all this stifled, gnawed, tore with its teeth - in the name of what? Their chests were engulfed in blood, their faces spasmodically twisted with anger when they remembered the infamous idiot who came with an axe in his hand from an unknown place and with unfathomable impudence pronounced a death sentence on the past, present, and future..."

Ugryum-Burcheyev woke up and returned to the construction of Nepreklosk, but the atmosphere had subtly changed. "He began to suspect something. He was struck by the silence during the day and the rustling at night. He saw how, with the onset of dusk, some shadows wandered around the city and disappeared somewhere, and how with the dawn of day, the same shadows appeared again in the city and scattered around the houses. This phenomenon was repeated for several days in a row, and each time he was tempted to rush out of the house to personally investigate the cause of the nightly commotion, but superstitious fear held him back."

The quotes are over. What's amazing about them is not that the great satirist portrayed a one-sided, not realistic but sharply grotesque image brought to monstrosity. That's what a satirist does. What's amazing is that, starting from specific historical figures of the past, figures of much smaller scale, he anticipated in his creation the gigantic figure of the future. Of course, he saw and portrayed it only from one side, the one that connected it with Russian despots of the past. But the long, sharp, soulful scrutiny of the typical images of Russian history and its trends led him to prophesy that the tyrannical tendency, manifested in Birone, Paul, Arakcheev, and Nicholas, would reach its culmination only in the future, and then the one who resembled Ugrium-Burcheev more than any of his predecessors would appear at the top of power.

The great tyrants of Russian history, Ivan the Terrible and Nicholas I, were tools of the demon of great-power statehood - and that's it. Their meta-historical significance was exhausted, not to mention the fact that during the first period of Ivan the Terrible's reign, the Demiurge ruled through this tsar, and at the end, it was Velga. Stalin was also a tool of the next Zhrugr, but the point is that his meta-historical significance was by no means exhausted by this.

No matter how great Russia was under Ivan the Terrible and especially under Nicholas, its victories and defeats, the increase or weakening of its power, could directly affect only a limited geographic area: Central Europe, the Middle East, and the Near East. The militant Russian ideology of the first two Zhrugrs - the idea of the Third Rome and the concept of "autocracy, orthodoxy, nationality" - were marked by provincialism, narrow nationalism, and confessionalism. This was entirely consistent with the stage of world technological development and international relations that humanity had reached at that time. But connections were strengthening and expanding, and technological achievements were changing the very concept of geographic space, bringing continents closer together, and forcing belligerent neighbors to face each other with the same density with which battling rams lock horns. Russia took a leading place in history from the moment when the international Doctrine came to power within it - for the first time in the world. Russia became the first country armed with such an ideology that could, in principle, spread to all countries on the planet. Even more than that: the Doctrine contained such an impulse for expansion that assumed the planet's borders as its limit. When we talk about world empires or the world aspirations of great conquerors of the past, from Genghis Khan to Napoleon and the British Empire, we use the word "world" in a conditional sense. Revolutionary Russia with its Doctrine was the first in history to embody the global trend in an absolutely unconditional sense. The secret lay in the fact that instead of dreaming of the universal hegemony of any particular nation (a utopian dream, because no nation is numerous enough for that), the idea of a universal community of peoples united by a new social system, which was supposed to arise everywhere as a result of revolutionary explosions, was proclaimed. The revolutionary, liberating influence of this concept on non-Russian countries, especially in the colonies and semi-colonies of the East and South, was colossal. In some countries, it gradually developed according to the program outlined in Moscow; in others, it was brought on the bayonets of Soviet armies. Many countries, such as India or Burma, have experienced a sharp change in their ethical and political coloration due to this revolutionary element. But wherever it was, the masses of those supra-nationalities, those countries, those nations were involved in revolutionary or transformative activities, not just Russia alone. Russia sought only to preserve, to the extent possible, its role as a guiding force (which, of course, was not always successful, and the further in time, the less so).

Naturally, it is for this reason that the images of both leaders of revolutionary Russia are seen not only as the outlines of the third Russian witzraor but also the clear shadow of a being that is infinitely more enormous, a planetary being - the implementer of the great demonic plan, whose name is Urparpa.

But the significance, role, and nature of these two human constructs were profoundly different. The first was a human, just like almost all bearers of light or dark missions. Of course, his shelter and all other components of his being were the subject of many years, if not centuries, of work to transform him into a obedient instrument of extranatural will. But despite all of this, his personal monad remained untouched. It continued to float in its multi-solar Iroln, and his human image and character inevitably reflected to some extent the light of this monad, no matter how many demonic pestles were placed between the monad and the man. Even qualities that seemed obstructive from the point of view of his mission remained in his character and could not be silenced finally. This man did not become bloodthirsty or actively cruel. He stubbornly believed in the Doctrine and worked not for his own sake but for the sake of this ideal. In his own way, he loved the people and humanity, albeit with a generalized-abstract, dreamy-headed love. He desired their well-being as he understood it, and if he sometimes resorted to very harsh measures, able to show even inexorability, it was dictated not by vengeance or inhumanity, but by confidence in the sad revolutionary necessity. Spilling blood or causing suffering did not bring him any pleasure.

Even when a perfect terrorist act was committed against him, causing him serious injury and almost costing him his life, the leader found the moral strength and sufficient political foresight, and perhaps even humanity, to insist that the political criminal be subjected not to execution but to imprisonment. He treated his party comrades with paternal care, and even against those among them who led oppositional currents within the party, he took no measures other than discussion, party persuasion, and the pressure of his own authority. Political figures who had demonstrated their dissent many times, such as Trotsky, Zinoviev, and Bukharin, remained active members of the elite and bore a tremendous burden in the overall party-state work.

Many instances where his intervention prevented an undeservedly harsh punishment or an overly drastic measure by the local authorities prove that the first leader often had access to universal feelings of pity, sympathy, and justice. He had sincerely absorbed the democratic ideals of previous generations; he was too intelligent to be turned into a tyrant. All of this is evidenced by his attitude towards the so-called national minorities of that time: his instructions on this matter are infused with such concern not to painfully offend the national self-esteem, which has been sharpened by centuries of persecution, full of such cautious humanity and understanding of the psychology of oppressed nations, that one wonders how such instructions could be so shamelessly and cynically ignored by his successor.

Lenin was an internationalist not only in words, but in deed. He was to a large extent the implementer of a dark mission, but he deeply believed that his activities were aimed at the good of humanity.

The different nature and different pre-existence of the second leader determined his completely different character.

Each of the incarnations of this creature was like a rehearsal. The penultimate time, he appeared on the historical stage in the very form that Dostoevsky captured with genius meta-historical foresight in his "Grand Inquisitor". It was not Torquemada or anyone else among the major leaders of this satanic experiment; but he did not belong to the rank-and-file workers of the Inquisition either. He appeared already in a decline of the political wave, and during his many years of life, it became clear to him that it would not be possible to turn the Catholic Church into an obedient mechanism of Gagtung, on the path to global tyranny. But the experience of activity within the framework of the Inquisition gave a lot to this creature, developing in him a thirst for power, a thirst for blood, sadistic cruelty, and at the same time outlining ways of connection between the inspiration of Gagtung, or rather - Urparp, and his daily consciousness. This inspiration began to be perceived at times not only through the subconscious sphere, as before, but directly presented to the circle of his waking mind. There is a special term: hochha. It denotes satanic admiration, that is, the type of ecstatic states when a person communicates with high demonic forces not in a dream, not in a trance, but with full consciousness. Now, in the XVI century, in Spain, hochha became available to this creature. It reached the level of conscious Satanism.

The interval between this incarnation and the next passed, firstly, in the Day, where the shelt, together with the astral, were thrown by the weight of terrible karma, and then in Gashsharve: the potential antichrist, extracted there by Urparp and his servants, was prepared for his new incarnation for more than 200 years. I remind you that the monad, once kidnapped for him from Iroln by Gagtung himself, from one of the emperors of Ancient Rome, continued to languish in captivity, in the depths of the purple ocean, in Digme, and the emperor's beheaded shelt remained in the form of a lethargic sleep in one of the cells of Gashsharve.

It seems, however, that deep within the creature in question, despite its acknowledged reverence for Gagtungur, there remained either a tiny spark or some shadow of doubt about the correctness of its choice. Perhaps, however, it was simply an instinctive fear of the unimaginably terrible catastrophe that would follow the impending apotheosis. Either way, this spark was finally extinguished at the beginning of its new existence on earth. In a small country on the border of Asia and Europe, in a mountain village, in a poor religious family, this creature once again saw the sunlight; and as a teenager, it forever rejected anything directly or indirectly related to Christianity. It seemed that Providential forces had once again opened the door to salvation for it, providing an opportunity for further path in the bosom of the church, as a priest. But what prospects could this modest path offer to a creature possessed by the impulse to rule the whole world? The preparation for the spiritual path - in both senses of the word - was forever and irrevocably abandoned. It is also possible that the choice was essentially made earlier, in Gashsharva, and now it only found a corresponding expression in Enrof. The object of the devil's centuries-old care joined the revolutionary movement in the Caucasus and thoroughly studied the Doctrine, clearly understanding that there was no better mask or program for its first actions after seizing power.

But why, or rather, for what reason was this creature, destined to rule over Russia, born not into a Russian family, but in the depths of another, peripheral, small nation? Obviously, for the same reason that Napoleon was not born a Frenchman, but a Corsican, not an inheritor by blood and spirit of the great French culture and national character of that people, but instead a usurper in double measure: a usurper not only of power, to which he was not called by either society or inheritance law, but also of power in a foreign country, not in his own. And Corsica and Georgia, harsh, mountainous countries, culturally backward, where human life is cheap and every conflict turns into bloody confrontation, did their job, strengthening in both of their offspring a profound contempt for the value of human life, burning vindictiveness, inability to forgive, and that amazing ease with which the natives of these countries are ready to resort to arms. In order to better fulfill their destiny in France and Russia, both of these creatures had to be as if foreign bodies in the body of both great countries, not bound by any irrational, profound, spiritual threads with the people who were to become the main arena of their activity and their main victim. It was necessary to come "with an ax in hand, one knows not from where, and with unfathomable audacity" to act as a conqueror on conquered land.

Louis XIV coldly led his wars, identifying the state with himself and sending thousands of Frenchmen to their deaths. Peter I sacrificed several tens of thousands of serf peasant souls for the construction of St. Petersburg. Lenin worked for the world revolution, which probably cost the lives of a million people. But to throw almost half of the male population of France into the jaws of continuous wars, which had the sole aim of expanding the zone of personal rule; to sacrifice at least ten million Russian soldiers to save his throne, which was blessed by no one and nothing, and then to put one-fifth of the country's population behind a barbed wire fence, while being ready to turn its most beautiful cities and most flourishing regions into a lunar landscape for the sake of the chimera of spreading his rule over the entire planet—no, neither Louis, nor Peter, nor Lenin would have dared to do such deeds—no one in whose veins flows the same blood as the blood shed by the people, for whom the cultural values of the nation are its values, its past and future are its past and future, and the land on which it treads is the precious, beloved and irreplaceable land of the Motherland.

But the 'father of lies,' preparing his creation from century to century, never instilled in it, of course, the whole truth - neither about the ultimate goals and possibilities, nor about the meaning of individual stages of preparation. Ensuring its incarnation for the last time, the great demonic mind understood that the conditions for the kingdom of Antichrist in Enrof had not yet ripened, just as the candidate himself was not at all ready for such a role. There were still no receptacles for those superhuman gifts that would be necessary for the lord of the world. The organs that were supposed to develop in his material composition remained in the embryonic state. There was nowhere to invest scientific genius, political genius, artistic genius, or the genius of dark religiosity. For the ability to immerse oneself in a state of hohha was still insufficient to clothe the material obtained through devilish vision in forms of a great quasi-religion that would be charming to humanity. Urparp knew better than anyone that it was not a spectacle that lay ahead, but only a dress rehearsal. But it was necessary to strengthen the illusion in the consciousness of the creature that it was not a rehearsal, but a long-awaited performance and that it would be able to achieve its universal goal in this incarnation if it played well. Such an illusion would be the strongest stimulus for the actor to give his all: the strongest stimulus in his activity in the position of the leader of the world revolutionary stream.

It's terrible to scrutinize the portrait of this creature that survived from those days when it was a child. What a striking contrast to the face of little Lenin! Nothing boyish, no glimmer of childishness!.. - An amazingly strange forehead, so lowered and narrowed by the edge of black, sleek, slicked-back hair that it would give the impression of degeneration if not for the strikingly shaped skull that is marked under the hair - a conical skull that does not round out smoothly backward but rises up and up to the very top. Tapering off, it finally culminates in that convexity that speaks of high mystical talent. The chin is long and narrow; later it will sharply widen. The nose protrudes aggressively forward; in the contours of the dry and pale, clenched lips - perseverance, heartlessness, and a strange, unintelligent stupidity. And the eyes, tightly squinted, look so grim, self-assured, and with such a certain hostility to everything in front of them that you will never find in a child.

For thirty years, the portrait of this creature loomed before us everywhere - no longer a boy, of course, but a man. It was impossible to take a step without encountering him to the right, left, or ahead. And it is difficult to break the habit of this face, of the multitude of associations that arise in us when we see it, and to look at these features impartially. In most portraits, the leader's eyes are slightly squinted, as if half-covered by slightly swollen eyelids. Sometimes it's a grimace that imitates a good-natured, sly half-smile, like Lenin's, and sometimes it's like a tense gaze into the distance. Only in a certain portrait belonging to the brush of Brodsky, are the eyes opened as they should be: impenetrable darkness, fierce and menacing, staring from there. Thick hair combed back hides the abnormality of the skull; the famous mustache softens the too-revealing line of the lips. However, the mustache themselves add an important nuance: the nuance of some vulgar primitiveness, as if their owner was proud of his masculine roughness and cultivated it in himself. The narrow oval face of childhood has long been replaced by a sharply defined square: this is explained by the crushing power of the jaws that has developed over the years, capable, it seems, of grinding stones. Incredible willpower is imprinted on this face, and equally boundless self-confidence. Not a single feature speaks - not of spirituality, but even of developed intelligence. Only deadly cunning in combination with incomprehensible stupidity can be seen in these features, as well as something that causes bewilderment and alarm: the skull! The skull! What do these extraordinary bulges of the head contain, what do these unique proportions signify?

Cunning, will, stupidity, inhumanity - these qualities alone are insufficient to leave the kind of mark on history that he left. There must also be gifts of the highest order. Perhaps they are testified to by what cannot be captured in the portrait - voice, timbre, diction? But we, his contemporaries, all heard this vibration-free, nuances-free, slow and dull voice of an automaton, this diction of an Eastern man who could not fully master the correct Russian language.

Who is this? Could it really be an idiot? But when and where, other than the town of Glupovo, does an idiot become the all-powerful ruler of a vast empire? And not by right of inheritance, but through his own efforts? For to seize power and then rule alone for three decades over a colossal state, making entire continents tremble, one must possess something other than idiocy.

But let us leave the portrait and examine the biography of this statesman. Contrary to Lenin's open and clear testament, warning the party against giving too extensive powers to this lover of "spicy dishes", the lover managed to elbow out all other contenders, who possessed greater merits and greater worth, in two or three years, skillfully bringing all competitors, who did not die themselves, to execution or ostracism through well-planned intrigues; he did not fail to crush, like insect nests, one opposition group after another inside and outside the party; he found ways to crush the intelligentsia, the breeding ground of dissent, into dust, and in exchange create his own equivalent of this cultural layer; he destroyed the external covers and forms of religion, making it serve his interests as faith and truth at the same time; he managed to create such a cultural regime that even the most desperate head was deprived of the actual ability to raise his voice against this regime; he managed to create such a security apparatus that the lord's life became absolutely out of reach for poison, dagger, bullets, or bombs; he put several million people behind bars just in case; he managed to merge the voices of the rest of the population into an incessant hymn - to him, only him, beloved, wise, native - oh, truly all of this required a special kind of genius. A specific, dark genius of tyranny.

The genius of tyranny consists mainly of two forces: the greatest force of self-assertion and the greatest cruelty.

Apparently, there has never been in the history of mankind a creature possessed by the thirst for self-assertion with such force, heat, and temperament. How pitiful looks the forty-meter statue of Nero in the image of Apollo, once erected by him near the Colosseum, if compared with the thousands of statues of the revolutionary leader erected everywhere, on any railway square, in any park, in any factory yard, and varying in size from the scale of an ordinary monument to the scale of the Colossus of Rhodes! To make the main street in every city bear his name, and a good third of all the collective farms in the country; to force any public meeting, no matter what issues it may be devoted to, to end with an ovation in honor of the leader; to make this glorification a duty of all forms of art, literature, music, and science; to compel half of humanity in the 20th century to consider him the leading figure in all branches of knowledge; to establish a mechanism for falsifying historical documents so that the revolutionary or state achievements of defeated rivals are attributed only to him; to write a new gospel glorifying himself and make the entire population study this garbage almost by heart; to create such a fog that countless masses of people abroad believed that they had been blessed with the greatest happiness of living at the same time as the most brilliant, wise, and humane of mortals... That compared to this, all the struggles of despots of the past: the falsification of history by Ramses II, the prayers before his image in the temple that Caligula forced some priests to perform, the hysterical cry of "Heil Hitler" thundering over Germany(2) for ten years, and even the mountains of human skulls or caravans with baskets full of torn-out human eyes - were apogees that only the imagination of any Chingiz-Khans and Timurs could have come up with.

------
(2): I say "ten years" because later the noise of patriotic cheers was completely drowned out by the roar of air raids and bomb explosions.

It is known that Stalin was very concerned about the rehabilitation of some of the monsters of the past, such as Ivan the Terrible, Malyuta Skuratov. And yet, about the same Ivan the Terrible, he disdainfully remarked at the end: "He executes a handful of boyars and then spends two weeks praying and repenting. A sissy!" Yes, perhaps only he had the right to call Ivan the Terrible a sissy.

These unprecedented forms and scales of tyranny speak of a superhuman thirst for self-assertion and equally superhuman cruelty.

He was as bloodthirsty as a true demon. By what considerations of state benefit, even distortedly understood, can you explain the system of periodic mass bloodletting? He allowed himself to do this for the first time at the beginning of collectivization, when the kulaks, or rather the prosperous peasantry, were liquidated "as a class" according to his plan. Crowds of people were deprived of their means of existence and, in conditions deadly even for cattle, were transported to uninhabited areas, where they surrendered their souls to God. "A roar was heard from somewhere; it seemed that whole villages were collapsing and there were cries, groans, and curses. Hay stacks, logs, rafts, and wreckage floated on the water..." There is no doubt that if the collectivization of agriculture had been led by at least Lenin - I'm not even talking about true humanists and democrats - this measure would have been carried out completely differently. It would have been implemented with cautious slowness, not by coercion, but by a visual demonstration of the benefits and expediency of collective farms, while preserving all the material values of individual farms. Both the peasantry and agriculture, as well as the state and the entire world Doctrine in general, would have benefited from this. Instead, in Ukraine and in some other places in 1933, an unprecedented famine broke out, which even led to cannibalism, and perhaps future historians will be able to establish at least an approximate number of victims of these measures. Following the first massacre came the second: the victims of the destruction of religious denominations. A short respite, while hordes of Gagtungr digested a magnificent portion of gawakh - and here comes a new dish to the feast tables in Gashsharva and Digme: two or three million victims of the "Yezhovshchina." Soon the death toll of the Great Patriotic War begins to rise. The second leader can be considered one of its perpetrators only relatively, but he bears responsibility for the scale of human casualties. Just as the source of gawakh is beginning to dry up in 1945, the human machinery of Urparp is already rushing to worry about the new one. It is no longer possible to fight - military resources are depleted, and the enemy managed to take the lead by inventing the atomic bomb; therefore, new flows of gawakh must be ensured in the conditions of international peace.

Mass repressions have begun. Without discrimination or reason, with an endless fabrication of cases out of thin air, with brutal torture, and with a regime in some "special camps" that make Auschwitz and Buchenwald pale in comparison. Of course, we do not yet have precise digital data on the victims of this period. However, it is beyond doubt that the number of deaths in camps from 1945 to 1953 amounts to several million, and if we add those who died earlier as well as those who were released prematurely en masse under Khrushchev, on the brink of the grave, we will have to forget about the previous units of measurement and move on to operations with tens of millions.

People were at a loss trying to make sense of what was happening. They tried to explain the atrocities as the machinations and cunning schemes of those who, by mistake of the leader, were put in charge of the security system. The leader himself contributed to this, periodically eliminating and severely punishing his subordinates. Following the executed Yagoda, Yezhov sank into oblivion, followed by Abakumov, and now, after the death of the leader, the one who headed the security system by the highest order for 15 years.

It was clear to everyone that such measures were not only not motivated by considerations of state benefit, but, on the contrary, were in flagrant contradiction with these interests. This will be clear to any historian. And to a metahistorian, it is also clear that in these oceans, neither Zhrugr nor Igva were interested in Gavvakh, as they feed not on Gavvakh but on the psychic emanations of the human emotional complex. In the eyes of the metahistorian, with these actions, Stalin exposed himself not as an instrument of the third Witzraor, but as an instrument of the Great Torturer himself, for only Gaghtungr and the demons of Gashsharva were interested in the influx of these unprecedented volumes of Gavvakh.

Thus, both components of what we can call the genius for tyranny in this being become clear: the thirst for self-assertion and active cruelty, brought to a state of almost ecstatic tension.

But Stalin still enjoys the reputation of a great statesman - a remarkable politician and diplomat, an outstanding military leader, a first-class organizer, and even a prominent cultural figure. Let's take a closer look: what were Stalin's main state tasks before World War II? It seems that they can be defined as follows: strengthening his absolute power and crushing any opposition; fighting spirituality; collectivization of agriculture; industrialization; preparing the military machine to repel possible attacks and to jump to the West, East, and South; creating a favorable international situation for this; maximizing the preservation of the human resources of the Soviet Union for the final showdown with the capitalist world.

However, to strengthen his own absolute power and completely crush any opposition, there is absolutely no need to be a great statesman. It is enough to be a brilliant tyrant. It is also enough to use the same methods as Stalin did to fight spirituality. As for the methods of collectivization, I have already spoken about how anti-state they were; I will now add that the country's disastrous lag in the production of agricultural products is not only due to the absurdities of collectivization, but also to the policy of squeezing all the juices out of the peasants and the clumsy management that characterized Stalin's entire agrarian course from beginning to end. It was also of great importance that the emphasis on excessive acceleration of the pace of development of heavy industry pulled huge masses of people out of the villages; even larger masses were pulled out by the Patriotic War, and after the war, nothing was done to stimulate the return of people to the land and actively engage them in increasing the productivity of agricultural labor.

Blind faith in the impact of purely external means led to the fact that all hopes were placed on the mechanization of agriculture. The result was the depopulation of the countryside, the expansion of the sector of empty lands, thousands of tractors and combines in the remaining sector, and the empty stomachs of collective farmers. Naturally, with all the truths and untruths, people ran away from villages to cities.

The state and the entire doctrine would have won if the industrialization plan had not been so one-sided, if the production of consumer goods had not been neglected. However, since the concern was not for the welfare of the population, but rather to easily convert industry to military production if necessary, the population was asked to endure one, two, three, four, or even two or three more five-year plans in order to provide the country with means of production. As a result, by the end of the thirty-year reign, the production of light industry, as well as agricultural products, was barely enough to satisfy the population of the large cities, and the rest of the population was forced to permanently suffer from a lack of the most basic necessities.

It seemed that everything was being done to create an unprecedentedly powerful war machine. But, strangely enough, even in this, perhaps the most important area of state work, everything turned out in some fatal way, not as desired. Tyranny, which could not tolerate any outstanding people near it, led to the fact that shortly before the Second World War, the top of the Soviet army was defeated, and dozens of talented military leaders were destroyed for unknown reasons together with Tukhachevsky. It is striking how little effect was produced by the concern for strengthening the military aviation. Even more surprising is that in both of the first five-year plans, no attention was paid to the construction of new communication routes, and by the time of the German invasion, the country had only the network of railways, most of which had been built in the 19th century. Even the most strategically important roads, such as most of the Moscow-Kiev highway, remained single-track, and in the vast Asian territories, only one serious railway was built in twenty years - the infamous Turkestan-Siberian railway. All this inept management, together with a chain of foreign policy blunders, resulted in the fact that in the very first year of the Patriotic War, the Soviet armies had to cede all territories to the enemy up to Stalingrad.

They speak of a brilliant politician, a remarkable diplomat. However, it is difficult to see anything remarkable in such a political course, which has kept the country in international isolation since the revolution and up until 1941; which, out of fear of foreign ideological influences, nails all windows shut - not only to Europe, but to anywhere; which, by supporting revolutionary movements in foreign countries and making statements about the upcoming fight against capitalism not for life, but for death, first causes concerns in other countries, then fear, and finally gives rise to such an aggressive opposing doctrine with an inhumane ideology as German National Socialism, which, not knowing which enemy is more dangerous - this nationalism or Anglo-French colonialism - darts from negotiations with one to a treaty of friendship with the other and eventually receives such a blow from a treacherous friend that the skull cracks. It is hardly possible to consider this political course more successful in its further development when the outstanding politician and remarkable diplomat allows himself to be fooled by promises to open a second front in 1942, then in 1943, and for three years allows his homeland to bleed while swallowing one diplomatic deception and failure after another himself.

However, some lessons were learned from all of this. The impotent rage that raged in the soul of this creature first under the blows of the German adversary and then from the realization of his own foolishness in diplomacy by Western powers - this rage became the strongest stimulus to turn all the attention, all the care, all the forces of the people, all the resources of the state to catch up with and surpass the strongest Western power in military affairs in the post-war years. Fortunately, this goal was achieved after his death - fortunately, because if he had done this earlier, the Third World War would already be a distant past at this moment, as would Paris, Rome, New York, London, Moscow, Leningrad, and everything else.

It is believed that Stalin had, to a certain extent, organizational abilities. Without such abilities, it would be impossible to coordinate control over all branches of the state to the degree of centralization that he achieved. This was particularly evident during the war years when he tirelessly led both the military machine and the home front, as well as international relations, meddling in all affairs. The question remains as to who, other than himself, needed this intervention in everything and whether in the end, it was beneficial to the defense effort. Only a true genius, or even a super-genius, could have avoided gross miscalculations, hasty decisions, and wrong conclusions in this chaos and frenzy, leaping from one question to a completely different one. Tyranny, intolerant of sharing the supreme authority with anyone, prevailed over the mind and will of the statesman.

As for applying the term "military leader" to Stalin, it is based on an obvious misunderstanding. History has not seen and will never see a military leader who dared not once to go to the front line during the entire four-year war, never inspired soldiers by the example of his own fearlessness and courage, and, on the contrary, hid in the most inaccessible corner and called upon actual military specialists, the marshals and generals, who bore the full weight of actual command, to ask for their authoritative opinion on every military question, only to then appropriate their opinions, decisions, strategic and tactical concepts. It is reasonable to think that Zhukov, Rokossovsky, or Malinovsky could tell a lot about how this Supreme Commander-in-Chief was able to be a wise initiator of things that he never even dreamed of before talking to them.

Gambling and state farsightedness are not compatible. During the war, Stalin was apparently so consumed by gambling that he had little interest in the post-war future, leading to irreparable mistakes. For example, during the four-year war, when every other able-bodied man in the country was drafted, the Generalissimo, obsessed with the idea of "everything for the war," prohibited soldiers and officers from taking leave. This naturally resulted in a catastrophic decline in birth rates. A four-year gap formed in the population growth, which would have had a terrible impact between 1959 and 1963, when there would have been no young people of conscription age in the face of an imminent third world war. Perhaps the leader thought he could unleash and end the third war before the generation born in the early 1940s reached conscription age.

Can someone who not only shears but also slaughters his own livestock be called a good shepherd? Can such a master, who forces vegetable shoots to be uprooted along with the weeds, not be considered a destroyer of his own estate? Can such a leader of a political course, on whom the military might of a neighbor falls like a ton of bricks, be called a good politician and diplomat? Can someone who frequently and arbitrarily eliminates experienced personnel from his own supporters be considered a wise party leader and true leader? This is not a shepherd, but a wolf.

Thus, the bearer of a peculiar dark genius, which manifested itself in everything related to tyranny, turned out to have no greater state abilities than the average person. Stalin was a bad host, a bad diplomat, a bad party leader, a bad statesman. He was not a general at all.

But we know some manifestations of his personality, in which the quality was even lower than "bad". This applies to the sphere of his so-called cultural activity.

"He was neither an engineer nor a technologist."

Remaining a dilettante in all areas of knowledge, except perhaps political and economic sciences, but imagining himself as a genius of an encyclopedic type, he with "unfathomable impudence" took on the leadership of the entire scientific life of the Soviet Union. Of course, he did not engage in laboratory research. But the activity of the entire system of the USSR Academy of Sciences, including all its institutes, as well as the work of primary, secondary, and higher schools, was directed in accordance with the instructions personally received from Stalin. This was not enough. Wide public discussions were organized on issues of biological, physical, and even astronomical disciplines, the task of which was to discuss and develop such a perspective on current scientific problems as was predicted and determined precisely by Stalin. But this was not enough either. In some areas of science, he even dared to act as a scientist-researcher; it is needless to remind that each of his judgments became an inviolable dogma for all specialists in this scientific field. Everyone still remembers his works in the field of linguistics, where common truths, such as the idea that language is the main means of communication between people, were mixed with frivolous statements. It is enough to recall the categorical statement that thinking without words is impossible - a statement that left specialists at a dead end, since it remained completely inexplicable how a composer thinks about his new creation or an architect understands the structure of a future building or a painter begins his painting.

Being very weakly gifted in visual thinking and accustomed to conducting almost all of his mental activity through words, Stalin apparently did not really understand the nature of artistic creativity. However, this did not prevent him from seeing himself as a deep connoisseur of aesthetic values, a penetrating guide to where and how artistic literature, architecture, painting, music, and theater should move. The well-known aphorism about Gorky's fairy tale "The Girl and Death" - "This thing is more powerful than Goethe's Faust" - may be complemented by another, which now few remember, but the documentary fixation of which can be found in newspapers for the year 1926 or 27. In those still patriarchal times, Stalin, together with Lunacharsky and Kalinin, visited the exhibition of the Moscow organization of artists "AKhR". As a moral lesson to posterity, the high guests left summaries of their impressions in the book of reviews. Lunacharsky took advantage of the opportunity to outline a whole aesthetic creed with his characteristic superficial brilliance. Kalinin was more modest: tactfully disclaiming any questions of art, he without any pretensions noted what he liked or didn't like at the exhibition and briefly explained how he managed and why he liked it. The third visitor turned out to be more laconic than anyone else. I reproduce his review literally: "In my opinion, not bad. J. Stalin".

But only six or seven years passed, and the man who exposed his artistic idiocy achieved such a position that the reins of all Soviet art and literature's Pegasus were clenched in his fist.

The imprint of artistic eclecticism, external gigantism, tastelessness, and a nouveau riche desire for ostentatious luxury cannot be washed away from everything that Stalin sought to immortalize himself as a great builder - whether it be Moscow metro stations and skyscrapers or Volgograd locks and new decorations. Individual successes - the happy achievements of some architects who managed to convince the leader of their artistic correctness - are drowned in the absurd accumulation of different styles - Doric porticos and Gothic spires, Renaissance lodges and modernized columns, in a forest of white sculptural groups waving marble banners and emblems, as if crying out about their poverty to the sky itself, and in the unparalleled absurdity of mosaics where figures in colorless party jackets and caps loom against a golden Byzantine background.

A genius tyrant. A bad ruler. A failed scientist. An artistic idiot. "Alas," an idiot, as Saltykov-Shchedrin was right. And this unfortunate idiocy was manifested not only in the artistic sphere. It was idiotic not to understand the boundaries of one's abilities and possibilities. Idiotic was the inflexibility of the mind, which was responsible for a long chain of political blunders, from underestimating Hitler in the thirties to the rupture with Yugoslavia on the eve of the fifties. The inability to respect anyone except oneself and the inability to understand even slightly subtle and complex emotional movements were also called idiotic. Despite his considerable erudition, Stalin remained, strangely enough, a semi-intellectual.

But why didn't Urparp make an effort to enrich this creature with governmental, scientific, and artistic genius? Wouldn't that have contributed to the universal triumph of Doctrine? Oh, it definitely would have! If governmental genius had prevented the second leader from making a long chain of truly fatal errors, then after thirty years of his reign, communist Russia would have achieved fabulous economic prosperity and unprecedented influence over the peoples of all countries. If his universal scientific genius had ensured such rapid scientific and technological development in Russia that this country had surpassed the development of capitalist states and their military machines, then it is highly likely that by the middle of the 20th century, the question would not have been about the communization of Korea or Vietnam, but about the domination of Doctrine over the entire world. And if the artistic genius of the second leader had brought to life genuine masterpieces of oral and written language, capable of "burning people's hearts with his words," instead of the flat nonsense of the "Short Course" or the tedious gum of his speeches and reports, it is indeed possible that the bearer of such genius would have achieved worldwide sole power, not only in his dreams.

Stalin's lack of genius in science, government, and art was a consequence of the desperate resistance of Providential forces. The dark gifts of scientific and artistic genius, already invested in him by Urparp, were paralyzed in the astral body of this creature even before his birth in Zatomis. However, governmental genius was taken from him after his appearance in Enrof when he was a child. He couldn't clearly understand what had happened, and Urparp didn't see fit to explain it to him. But the vague memory of receiving dark gifts continued to live within him, which led to the gap between his profound belief in his encyclopedic genius and the fact that, except for tyranny, he could not display this genius in any other field. Stalin was a potential, unrealized dark universal genius due to the resistance of bright forces.

However, the demonic mind did not view the Doctrine as the only thing that could and should unite the world. Other options were also being considered. The International Revolutionary Doctrine was only the first serious attempt, an experiment, a dress rehearsal: its course should have revealed what cement and whose forces could achieve this universal union more firmly and at the same time more soullessly. The potential, unmanifested dark genius could be taken from Enrof to Gashsharva in order to undergo final preparation and take on his last incarnation in the next century when the Doctrine implemented would have removed the final obstacle from his path to absolute power, and the dark gifts would finally be infused, squeezed, and stamped into him because by then Urparp would already know how to paralyze these gifts with the bright principle, and he would be able to avoid losing again for the second time.

During the final rehearsal, many other things had to be resolved. In particular, it had to be decided whether this candidate for antichrists was truly stronger than all the others. True, there were only two others, it seems, and one of them, for various reasons, could not be born in Enrof at this time. But the second remained, and the struggle between them should have finally and unmistakably revealed who should play the leading role in the long-awaited spectacle.

I do not know who he was, by what means he was led, or how another candidate was prepared. I see only the results. I see that he possessed the genius ability to tyrannize: the same thirst for self-assertion, the same bloodthirstiness, the same ability for any wrongdoing. However, the human machinery of the third witzraor of Germany, whose meta-historical meaning is by no means exhausted by the envelopment of this witzraor, was unable to bring these qualities to perfection. Some purely human traits in him were not completely eradicated.

Stalin fully allowed for the possibility that he would live to a stage in the development of science when it could extend his life far beyond the natural limits of a human, and perhaps even give him physical immortality. Apparently, with age, this dream only grew stronger. Therefore, he planned his state policy as if he would never have to leave the stage. He did not think about those who would succeed him, did not make any provisions in case of his death, no wills. "After me, the deluge," he could have said, if his idea was not expressed more precisely by another aphorism: "I will always be. The assumption that something will happen after me is meaningless." The countless sculptural images of his own person, which he planted everywhere by the thousands, should not be understood as an attempt to perpetuate his image in the minds of future generations. Perhaps this motive played some role at first, but later it was completely replaced by another: it was not perpetuation in the minds of future generations, but self-glorification for contemporaries. It is characteristic that despite the diversity of forms and methods in the cult of his personality, he did not even think to prepare a mausoleum for himself: he did not want to entertain the thought that he would ever have to be buried or mummified.

Such soaring heights of self-cult worship in the rarefied atmosphere of belief in his own immortality were not within the reach of his German rival. The latter felt himself to be the greatest conqueror of all time, an unparalleled and providential figure, called to bring happiness to the German people and to achieve Germany's world hegemony. He even hinted darkly that after the war he would give the people a new religion. But he never imagined himself to be physically immortal, periodically returning to the development of his will for his successors. And he even officially appointed Göring as the closest successor to all the duties and powers of the leader.

I don't know how he came to Enrof in Germany, but in any case, he was not a foreign body in the body of Germany. He was not an outsider without pedigree, but a man who embodied one - admittedly the most terrible, but characteristic - side of the German nation. He himself felt like a German through and through, flesh of his people's flesh and blood of their blood. He loved his country and his people with a strange love in which almost zoological demosexuality mixed with the dream - no matter what, to bestow on this people the bliss of world domination. And it would have been enough for him to lead the people to this bliss, to settle them in it, and then to retreat to some otherworldly heights and enjoy seeing the dazzling fruits of his labors from there, inhaling the fumes of grateful generations.

True, when the war, roughly overturning all his calculations, turned out not to be an enticing blitzkrieg, but an unprecedented meat grinder, grinding the flesh of his people for six years (other peoples were deeply indifferent to him), he, gnashing his teeth, foaming at the mouth, throwing himself on the floor and biting the carpet out of anger, frustration, and grief over his dying fellow citizens, still drove them and drove them to the slaughter until the very last minute of his existence. But this was not the icy heartlessness with which his enemy threw millions of Russians into the meat grinder, but a desperate attempt to somehow reach the moment when fortune would turn its face to him and the atom bomb, finally invented by the Germans, would turn Moscow and London into nothingness.

His opposition of himself and his teachings to any spirituality also lacked consistency and finality. He looked favorably upon the attempts of a certain circle, grouped around Matilda Ludendorff, to establish a modernized cult of ancient German paganism, but he never fully broke with Christianity. While encouraging the spread of a very vague yet spiritual worldview ("Gottgläubig") within his party, he himself was married in a church ceremony to Eva Braun just two days before his suicide.

In general, there is a hint of romanticism in the picture of his downfall. The trembling bomb shelter in the basement of the Imperial Chancellery, the constantly received reports of the enemy's approach to the very heart of the capital, the half-crazed, pale-to-the-point-of-blue man who could only whisper, his wild last-minute wedding, his suicide with the words that he is leaving, but "will keep watch from another world here, in the heart of Germany" - all of this, despite its phantasmagoric nature, is entirely human - not in the sense of humanity, of course, but in the sense that a creature fit to play the role of a universal absolute tyrant could never sink to such sentimental agony.

I will not dwell on those qualities of his character and mind which he yielded to his enemy and which may serve as material for reflection for the historian. I only point out those traits by which, when compared to Stalin, he lost out in terms of meta-history as a candidate for absolute tyrants.

Under this perspective, as well as all others, his ideological concept was losing. It lacked the one aspect that made Doctrine strong: internationalism. The dream of a 70-million German nation dominating the Earth's two billion plus inhabitants could truly be called a delusion. Even if Germany had miraculously won the Second World War, the concept would have had to be completely revised, expanding the "nation's" base to at least the borders of the European "master race". However, even then, due to its nature, this concept would have become an object of hatred and disgust for the vast majority of the people on our planet. Urparp's task, on the other hand, is just the opposite: to crystallize such a teaching that, while containing the core of future world tyranny, would initially seem attractive to the majority.

It is interesting to note that while the concept of national socialism suffered from hopeless nationalist or racial limitations, the Soviet Doctrine - in the form it existed during the first twenty years of its rule - was distinguished by the opposite defect: all this time it was treated with contempt and even hostility towards the national impulse in the psychology of the masses. The national element was tolerated only in those cases where it concerned national minorities or oppressed nations of the colonies. But this was a defect, and Stalin understood this. Several years earlier, driven by impulses that were obviously not far from the hooligan need to break mirrors and statues, he demolished monuments of Russian architecture without any need, turned churches and monasteries into God-knows-what, and destroyed other civil structures under the pretext of straightening the streets (that is, for the sake of the ill-fated idea of "straightness"). Now, suddenly, he turned to Russia's national past, rehabilitated an entire pantheon of Russian statesmen of past epochs, and stimulated the upbringing of a synthetic - both nationally Russian and internationally Soviet - feeling of "Homeland" in the younger generation. He understood that, given the impending clash with the aggressively nationalist ideology of fascism, it was not necessary to disregard the national impulse in one's own people. On the contrary: it should be stirred up, awakened, and made to pour water on the same mill. And soon after the start of the war, he understood something else: the confessions, which had not been eradicated from the mass psychology by any anti-religious policy, had to be turned into faithful servants and then into slaves. Several insignificant gestures, such as the gracious permission to restore the patriarchal throne and promises to refrain from demolishing churches in the future (fortunately, there were still about one-tenth of them left), turned out to be enough for the church hierarchy to fully align with the program and practice of the party and state.

But this happened already during the war, when the slogan "Everything for the war!" flared up in his mind like a torch. It flared up because the enemy, whom he had planned to outsmart by bleeding him dry in a struggle against Western democracies, only to later unleash his international Doctrine and a fresh 20-million-man army on them when both coalitions weakened, had actually outsmarted him, preempted him, muddled all the cards, and as thunder from a clear sky, Germany and its allies' aerial bombs rained down on an unprepared country.

It was a moment of weakness. That moment when the leader, standing before the microphone, tapped his teeth to the rhythm of water in a glass. That moment, unfortunately, stretched for several months until in October of '41, the leader, tears streaming down his face, handed Zhukov the full command of the Moscow front, already half surrounded by German armies, and implored him with a voice that at last showed some vibrancy, to save everyone and everything from destruction. He never forgot that moment. Shame was familiar to his nature only in one aspect: shame before those who had seen his weakness. Zhukov was indispensable as long as the war lasted. But when it ended, the first opportune moment was used to preserve this witness more tightly.

However, it is possible that besides shame for his weakness before people, the leader felt another, even more agonizing feeling: fear that he had discredited himself in Urparpa's eyes with that moment, having caused in Shadanakar's demonic mind the doubt: Is he not a weakling himself, Joseph Vissarionovich? He had to prove with his behavior as soon as possible that the moment of weakness would never repeat itself and that he would endure the deadly rivalry until the end, throwing even a hundred million into the meat grinder without flinching a muscle, if necessary. That's how he held himself afterward.

What was the attitude of the Providence forces of Russia towards this being when it found itself, by fate, at the head of a state fighting not for life, but for death against an alien enemy? This attitude was determined by two factors. The first factor was the irreparably demonic nature of this being. Providence could not help it under any circumstances. It was enough that Zhrugr was helping him with all his strained power and that the Great Igva Drukkarga was using his ability to enter a state of "hohha" to reason with him and correct his actions. But the second factor was that the concept of the Third Reich threatened, in the event of its victory, even more terrifying disasters. It threatened the complete destruction of the Russian state and the transformation of Russia into a devastated zone of the inhuman and implacable enemy's domination. On a larger scale, it promised the defeat and destruction of Western states - carriers of the most democratic regimes and the spreading of a black shroud of a long, deadly physical and spiritual era of the domination of the "master race" over the world, from Japan and Australia to England and Canada. This path to world tyranny may have been even more direct, even less promising in terms of salvific breakthroughs and emanations, than the victory of the international Doctrine.

Therefore, the demiurge and Synclite of Russia ceased their constant transphysical struggle with Drukkarga at the moment when hordes of foreign igvas from the Shrastra Klingzora fell upon this underground citadel. As a reflection of this, the struggle with those who led the Russian state in Enrof was also discontinued. They were not helped, but none of their forces could be distracted anymore from the struggle with the forces of Light and focused entirely on the war with an even darker enemy than themselves. Deep night fell. The forces of Light condemned themselves to temporary voluntary inaction until the battle of monsters was over. Only the twists and turns of this battle were visible to everyone on earth; as if a spiritual paralysis had paralyzed the higher abilities of humans, and only the most intense meditations and the highest creative flight could occasionally lift the human soul above the impenetrable roof of darkness.

At this fateful time, the second Zhrugrite sprouted. The first had sprouted long ago, shortly after the end of the civil war. The struggle within the ruling party and the fierce resistance of some of the Communist elite's most prominent figures against Stalin reflected this metahistorical event. But the first Zhrugrite was weak and suffocated at the very beginning. Now, a new one has appeared; it has established contact with the enemy army's leadership, even with the Great Igva of the German Shrastra, hoping that the defeat of Drukkarg will allow him to take his father's place, as the German Witzraor seemed too limited in his abilities to rule directly in Drukkarg. The second Zhrugrite acted, gradually retreating until the end of the war when Zhrug, having devoured the enemy's heart and dramatically increased in power, destroyed his foolish offspring, so to speak, with a single snap.

At the end of the war, the emanation of the state's feelings complex, which is replenished by the loss of strength of Zhrug and Igvas, was brought by the efforts of the leader and the party to such volumes that would be unthinkable in peacetime. This emanation was contributed to by everyone and everything: from propagandists and agitators in the army to priests on the pulpits, from the most famous composers and writers to the microscopic and unknown print and film workers, from leading scientists to the smallest party workers in the factories. Various instincts were appealed to, including patriotism, nationalism, internationalism, faith in God, faith in the party, the desire for peace, which could only come through victory, and disgust and horror at the atrocities of fascism, and love for one's country, family, home, and children.

Therefore, by the end of the war, Zhrugr's power was unprecedented. Many Igvas and Raruggs fell in battle, but the Witzraor grew stronger than they had ever seen before. He thirsted for expansion, he invaded the German Shrastra, he killed the great Igva of Germany, caused a formal pogrom, and was barely introduced to some limits by the Witzraors of England and America - Ustrom and Stabing.

One unexpected event forced Stalin to pause in his push towards the West. He had been warned of it, but had not given this danger due importance. In May 1945, when plans were already underway to attack recent allies, the leader was informed - not from a mystical source, but from a completely earthly one - about the first atomic bomb test in New Mexico. He felt something like the atomic bomb exploding in his consciousness. Instead of the long-awaited transformation of the Second World War against fascism into the destruction of the entire capitalist world, instead of the triumphant march of revolutionary armies through France, Spain, Africa and who knows where else, it was now necessary to freeze in place, biting one's elbows and calculating how many years it would take to also acquire atomic weapons, catch up with and surpass the enemy, and, by lightning transformation of the capital's into desert, proclaim the unification of the world under the supreme authority of the one man-god.

The danger of the global spread of national socialism was crushed. New dangers were already becoming quite clear. One of them was that on the soil of the Second World War, the witzraor of America grew to dizzying proportions with incredible speed. It seemed that the row of skyscrapers was now separated from Europe not by an ocean, but by a puddle of water. This witzraor was able to unite with its distant relatives in Western Europe and position itself so that its tentacles were groping along almost all the borders of the Soviet Union. Taking into account the mistakes of its German predecessor, it was developing an ideological concept that, instead of something provincial and local, put forward cosmopolitanism - an idea as fraught with world potential as the Doctrine itself. Gagtungr's gaze stopped with greater benevolence on Stabbing, and he paid greater attention to his involution.

Another danger was the transformation that occurred to Russia, both spiritually and physically, as a result of the Second World War. The authoritarian tyranny took on dimensions and forms that no longer resembled reality, but were clearly fantastical. One wanted to say: this cannot be, we are all dreaming, we are all delirious. But because it was undeniable, and at the same time everyone was not only not sleeping but also working at a frenzied pace, not to mention the mass arrests, no one could spend even one night peacefully. It began to feel as though, amidst the daily bacchanalia, some otherworldly, incomprehensible, and completely inhuman bacchanalia was shining through.

Repressions have intensified. Wave after wave, one category of citizens after another were arrested and received 25-year prison sentences or were shot. Fascists and communists, Trotskyists and White emigrants, intellectuals and peasants, generals and deserters, workers and priests, atheists and sectarians, Orthodox and Jews, hooligans and monks, bandits and non-resistants, prostitutes and scientists, thieves and philosophers, Tolstoyans and homosexuals, party secretaries and Benderites, engineers and partisans crowded in prisons and labor camps, paying for their actual or imagined transgressions, all those who remained in the territory once occupied by Germans, and all those who directly or indirectly participated in the Ukrainian and Baltic independence movements - all those suspected of sympathizing with the counter-partisans or having excessive sympathies for the state of Israel. Those who had been in German captivity and, succumbing to homesickness for their homeland and loved ones, risked returning home, and those who were in units of the Soviet Army that had occupied Central Europe and, upon returning to Russia, shared some observations and conclusions. Those who told a joke and those who wrote letters to the leader as children hoping to open his eyes to the lawlessness taking place. All those who had ever had the misfortune of talking to a foreigner were sent to Vorkuta, Karaganda, Kolyma, or Potma; all those who expressed doubt about the expediency of any government measure, party policy, or government decree. People who, in a fit of anger, had ever wished that someone close to them would die so that the father of nations would leave this world sooner, were accused of plotting a terrorist act against the leader. Those who were present when a fatal wish was expressed, their relatives, acquaintances, and acquaintances of acquaintances were also accused. Torture was used to extract confessions for things that never happened. Several thousand workers of the Leningrad party organization paid with their lives or were imprisoned for many years for an imaginary attempt to separate the Leningrad region from the Soviet metropolis. Neither the absurdity of the accusations nor the ridiculousness of the evidence bothered anyone. The case piled up on top of the case, fabrication on top of fabrication. In any corner of the country, it was difficult to find a family that had not lost someone in the camps or prisons; many families were uprooted entirely. All procedural norms and any legality were discarded as soon as a person was investigated under the notorious Article 58 of the Criminal Code, meaning they were a political criminal. They returned to medieval methods of extracting confessions; they remembered and used the experience of the Inquisition, enriching it with new techniques that corresponded to a different level of technological development. The widest network of official and unofficial informants ensnared society, from members of the Politburo to Turkmen shepherds and Ukrainian milkmaids. How could one not remember the ubiquitous network of spies and informants implanted by Ugryum-Burcheyev in every house of the illustrious city of Nepreklovensk, and what Shchedrin defined as universal panic fear?

Fear, dense and suffocating, overshadowed the society and filled every thought, feeling, and word with its presence, taking away all joy and meaning from life. The fear was compounded by the rumors that leaked out of the camps, despite everything, about the regime that prevailed there, the extinction of entire camps from hunger, the impossible production norms for prisoners, the sadism of the authorities and supervisors, and the killing of those who had committed any kind of offense in unheard-of ways, such as tying them naked to a tree or post to be eaten by mosquitoes and Siberian gnats.

The camps created a regime that killed not only physically but also spiritually. People who were subjected to abuse, unbearable labor, surveillance, and reporting, as well as malnutrition and a lack of medical care, lost the will to resist morally long before their deaths, and became dehumanized. Political prisoners, half of whom were innocent, while the other half were guilty of offenses that in any other state would have resulted in a few weeks of detention or a minor fine, were resettled among bandits, hardened killers and rapists, and minors whose interaction with adult criminals corrupted them completely.

The idea of rehabilitating criminals did not even occur to anyone, and the camps became giant charnel houses. Rivalry was provoked between national groups, which escalated into mutual bloody clashes. An atmosphere reigned in which only a few could withstand without being mentally and morally mutilated. However, the majority of these unfortunate people did not expect liberation even after their deaths, as their etheric body decayed and the burden of their karma dragged their souls into the gray cauldrons of Zatomis, the silent darkness of Enrof, the horrible Agur, and all of the Synclite of Russia did not have enough power to ease or accelerate their ascent from the gloomy purgatories.

    He drives people like herds
    To uncharted depths,
    With an iron staff he drives them...

When this book sees the light, dozens of others will also be seen – personal memories, documentary records, and historical research that will recreate the picture of the mass nightmare in which 20, if not more, million people were immersed with exhaustive completeness. The individual crimes committed against prominent figures of the Soviet state will be fully revealed: the strange story of why, how, and at whose instigation Kirov was killed, how Kossior, Postyshev, Rudzutak, Ordzhonikidze, Tukhachevsky, Kuybyshev, Voznesensky, and Zhdanov died; how Khrushchev, Malenkov, and even Molotov managed to avoid the same fate. Our grandchildren will learn why the life paths of cultural figures such as Vsevolod Meyerhold, Boris Pilnyak, Osip Mandelstam, Nikolai Klyuev, Sergei Klychkov, Artem Vesely, Nikolai Vavilov, and Pavel Florensky were cut short. But they will never know how many remarkable talents, how many writers and poets, artists and actors, thinkers and scientists, whose names could have become the pride of Russia, remained unknown to anyone, and their works were not even preserved in ashes – how many such creators were destroyed by the satanic machine, which, in mockery, was named "security organs."

Of course, there is no mitigating circumstance when considering the activities of such executioners of the people as Yezhov, Abakumov, and Beria. But it would be childish to try to place sole responsibility for these hecatombs on them.

It is quite clear whose supreme will acted through these ominous figures and what inspirer, by turns putting them at the helm of the devil's machine, thought that he himself would remain in the eyes of the people as stern but fair as a shepherd of bodies and souls.

But the one who sowed this panicked, almost metaphysical fear around him lived in constant fear himself, according to the iron logic of his actions. Having poisoned the life of society, he also poisoned his own life, depriving himself of any joy except the pleasure of tyranny.

Even Hitler and Mussolini were not devoid of personal bravery. They appeared in parades and celebrations in open cars, and during the war, they were seen on the front lines many times. Once, Hitler was caught by surprise by the sudden appearance of an enemy tank column on the Russian front and barely escaped capture. Stalin, on the other hand, never showed a glimmer of personal courage during his entire reign. On the contrary, he was always trembling for his physical existence, erecting an impenetrable wall around himself. This was probably because, in a state of paranoia, he realized more clearly than others the terrible prospect that would inevitably engulf him in the event of his death - a fall through the torments of magma and the Core to the Bottom of Shadanakar. Naturally, he clung to life as best he could until science discovers ways to make him physically immortal. But over the years, this fear of death has become a mania for persecution. It was the same mania that poisoned the lives of many other tyrants. It tormented Tiberius and Domitian, Louis XI and Sultan Alla-ed-Din, drove Ivan the Terrible and Paul I to madness. Moreover, it remained only one aspect of a more general mental disorder, which in psychiatry is called megalomania. It consists of a combination of a persecution complex, firstly, with sadism, an insatiable thirst for blood and the suffering of others, and secondly, with a belief in one's own infinite superiority over all past and present people, and a loss of a clear understanding of the limits of one's power. As a rule, the despot's megalomania is expressed externally in the intensification of lawless and inhuman repressions, in the adoption of exaggerated measures for one's own security, in constant concerns about self-glorification, and in a chain of grandiose, but often unnecessary and ridiculous construction projects, even harmful to the state. For example, Caligula forced the building of mountains in the middle of nowhere and dug whole lakes on the site of the mountains for a single naval parade, and later planned to build a new Rome high above the world on the glaciers of the Alps. The grandiose and senseless undertakings of Nero, Domitian, and Heliogabalus are also well known. All this was useless for society or undertaken under the pretext of this benefit, but in reality, only for the glory of the ruler. Buildings like these should amaze the imagination with their supernatural size and luxurious finishing. Stalin's tasteless-but-magnificent Moscow metro stations, unnecessarily expensive high-rise buildings, the talentless yet grandiose university, or the brightly colored Volgodon locks with strange and inappropriate extravagance, were all such constructions. Incredible sums of money were spent on these "architectural excesses" as Khrushchev later called them, not in the interests of the people or the state, but only for self-glorification.

It is amazing that after such a clear and vivid lesson, some theorists still deliberately underestimate the role of personality in history. It seems that we are already beginning to forget how the imprint of a personality, even its completely private habits and inclinations, is imposed on the life of a huge society. Stalin, for example, liked to work at night. This was enough to make the entire state apparatus change its work to an unnatural night schedule. None of the responsible workers, not even a single engineer, could get a normal night's sleep. They were constantly called out of bed by phone and summoned to work. Tens of thousands of workers went to bed not at night, but in the morning. They slept in pieces, in two or three shifts, were deprived of the opportunity to spend evenings with their families, visit the theater or a concert. They did not even dare to go anywhere while on vacation without leaving their address with their superiors. This continued not for months or years, but for fifteen years.

Partly out of fear of speaking in front of a "filtered" audience, and partly out of his immense disdain for the people over whom he had total control, in the last years of his life Stalin almost never appeared in public. Even when his 70th birthday was celebrated in 1949 with the kind of pomp and sycophancy that the world had never seen before, he didn't utter a single word while attending the banquet and concert, which were held in his honor with the splendor of "A Thousand and One Nights". His audacity knew no bounds. Not even a simple word of gratitude escaped his lips. He appeared gloomy and dissatisfied, although it remained completely unclear with what.

In fact, it was the zenith of his power. His last great international action was coming to an end: the communization of China. What oppressed him? Was it the Americans' invention of the hydrogen bomb? But the Soviet Union itself already possessed thermonuclear weapons. Or was it just a momentary bad mood, such as any despot might have? But for the sake of decorum, he could have suppressed this vile mood in the presence of dozens of foreign observers on such a significant day, before literally the whole world. Obviously, something deeper, beyond the power of his will, was gnawing at him. It was the knowledge of what was happening outside of Enrof, gleaned by him in a state of hohha.

I don't know if anyone has ever seen him in this state. In the 1930s and 1940s, he had such a mastery of the hohha that he could often summon it at will. This usually happened towards the end of the night, more often in winter than in summer, when the early dawn light didn't interfere. Everyone thought he was resting or sleeping, and no one would dare disturb him under any circumstances. However, no one could have entered even if they wanted to, as he locked the door from the inside. The room remained shaded but not dark. If an invisible person had entered at that moment, they would have found the leader not asleep but sitting in a deep, peaceful armchair. The expression on his face, which no one had ever seen before, would have been truly remarkable. His black eyes, which had become colossal, stared unblinkingly into space. A strange matte blush appeared on his cheeks, which had lost their usual oiliness. The wrinkles seemed to have disappeared, and his whole face looked unrecognizably younger. The skin on his forehead was so tight that it seemed larger than usual. His breathing was shallow and very deep. His hands rested on the armrests, and his fingers occasionally lightly stroked their edges.

Hohha is not actually a state but a whole type of states, differing from each other in which layer of the dark hierarchies the spirit-seer enters into communication with. But in all cases, physical objects in the environment vaguely appear to him through the images of other layers. If by some miracle someone entered the room at that moment, the visionary would have noticed him and, although not immediately, could switch to the usual plane.

Stalin's most frequent hohha were when he communicated with the great Igua Drukkarga and Zhrugr; sometimes he was honored with direct inspiration from Urparp himself. There was also another invisible creature specially attached to him, his constant advisor, one of the inhabitants of Gashsharva, something like an antidaimon.

In a state of hohha, Stalin repeatedly entered Gashsharva and Drukkarg, where he was seen not only by the great igvams, but also by some others. From afar, he was shown Digm. He was carefully led, incognito, through certain areas of Mudgabra and Yunukamna, and contemplated the purgatory and layers of magma. From afar, and very dimly, he even saw the zatomis of Russia and once witnessed Jesus Christ descending there, having assumed an enlightened body. But this encounter evoked nothing in the dark seer except an intensification of deadly hatred, which is why it was allowed by Urparp.

Hohha infused this creature with tremendous energy, and in the morning, appearing among his close associates, he stunned them all with such an inhuman charge of strength that it alone would have been sufficient for their volitional enslavement.

It was precisely in the hohha states that followed one after another on the eve of his 70th birthday, over several nights, that he became aware, in general terms, of very unpleasant events happening at that time in Russian metaculture and adjacent areas. He appeared as a silent and powerless witness to one of the most brutal battles in the afterlife. The Demiurges of Russia, China, Mahayana, Indomalayan metaculture, and both Western metacultures fought against Zhrugr and Laizho, his new ally - a strange child of two witzraors, Russian and Chinese.

The witzraors were not destroyed, but their expansion was halted. An inviolable circle was drawn around them. Attempts by the witzraors to resume their offensive after some time led nowhere, and in Enrof, a three-year war in Korea came to an end, after which they had to return to the original position.

Then a course of "all or nothing" was taken - for the fastest preparation and unleashing of the Third World War, because further developments threatened to shift the center of gravity to the North - the Western shrastr, and to transfer the sanction of Gagtung to Zhrugr.

Through constant efforts of demonic forces around Stalin, something like impenetrable shadows of darkness was woven. No influence of providential principles could reach him until, finally, after incredible efforts from the side of the synclite, not only Russian, during her stay in Hohha, these shadows were breached for a moment. In that moment, he was shown not the panoramas of bright worlds - which would only have increased his hatred - but the distant stages of his own future path, his possible incarnation as the Antichrist, and the ultimate catastrophe: falling into the Pit of the Galaxy - the very place where there is no time - a place of suffering that is more terrible and hopeless than anything in the universe. This was a night of indescribable horror. The horror was such that for a few minutes, his whole being was inflamed with desperate prayer - to save him, to prevent him from taking further steps on this path. Minutes passed. Pride, stubbornness, and a thirst for boundless power prevailed. But this night, which happened in 1952, had some effect. The plunges into Hohha after this no longer infused him with new strength. Perhaps the psychological burden was too heavy - the eternal walking in the mask of materialism, Marxism, this constant double life. He was torn, as it were. Strength continued to flow into him only from Zhrugr through a constant channel of involution. In a short time, the leader aged, and constant physical ailments finally undermined his nervous equilibrium.

It tore her apart, as did the fear of new rivals. The first, of course, was Stabing, which was completely obvious. However, in the upper circles of the American people, there were no plans for a creature like Gagtungur to become a new candidate for antichrists. But now, the consciousness, reason, and some vague information obtained from earthly sources were causing such confusion that the leader began to see a new and terrifying opponent, not yet discovered as a specific human being, but already born somewhere in Enrof, more frightening than Hitler. And just as he himself, ruling in Russia, was not Russian by blood and spirit, but Georgian, so the potential opponent did not seem to him to be an American by birth. He imagined that this candidate should come from the depths of world Jewry: he knew that there were certain narrow circles in Jewry, which were trying to raise a world ruler, and he decided that Hitler had not been so mercilessly dealing with the Jewish people for no reason. However, such a crude approach was not the way to go. Gradually, at least the Jews of the Soviet Union should be resettled in special zones, where they could be properly probed, every last one of them.

Consciousness began to falter.

The longer the creature remained in power, the more dangerous it seemed, having lost all sense of proportion and perspective. Urparp could no longer infuse it with his energy or emanate his thoughts through the hohhu, and only Zhrugr still had a semblance of the umbilical cord, an ethereal channel of envelopment connecting him to the human-ore. Possessed by the great demonic mind of Shadankar, Witzraor was preparing for a decisive invasion, with all the military might of Drukkarga and the Chinese Shrastra, into the territories of other metacultures. He was increasingly impressing upon his conduit the resolve to unleash the Third World War. The attack was to be sudden and instantaneous, with several dozen hydrogen bombs dropped within a few hours on the vital centers of Western nations, thus ensuring the victory of the Doctrine. Otherwise, Urparp's sanction would be transferred to Stebing, and Stalin, having died in Enrof, would possibly be taken to Gashsharva for final preparation for his ultimate incarnation. If the Doctrine had to pave the way for world tyranny in Enrof, it would not be the one to succeed, but rather the concept that would defeat it and create a new seductive universal doctrine based on cosmopolitanism. The demonic mind understood, of course, that the destructive power of the Third World War would cause devastation to entire countries, which was undesirable in itself, but the new huge influx of Gawakh was highly desirable. In addition, it was assumed that the lightning nature of the war would limit the scope of possible devastation.

In the early days of March 1953, a decisive battle took place between Yarosvet and Zhrugr. The channel of involution that connected the creature Witzraor with its human-made vessel was severed in an instant. If this could have been done earlier, the life of the human-made vessel would have ended just as quickly because no human strength was sufficient to withstand the burden that lay on its psyche and physical body. This occurred around two o'clock in the morning. Half an hour later, consciousness faded, but the agony continued for several days, as is well known. Urparp caught the severed end of the channel of involution and tried to infuse strength and consciousness into the dying vessel himself. This did not succeed partly because several people who were hovering by the deathbed tried to prevent him from coming back to life. The motives behind these people were different. Some feared that if he stayed at the head of the state, he would unleash war, which they saw as a great disaster for everyone and a deadly danger to the Doctrine. But among the close associates was also the one who had stood at the helm of the security mechanism for so many years; he knew that the leader had already marked him as the next victim, the next gift to the grumbling masses; in their eyes, he had to bear all the responsibility for the millions of innocent deaths. Stalin's death opened up a chance for him to take his place. The line of his activity during the leader's life was dictated by three motives: to intimidate Stalin by inflating and inventing physical dangers that supposedly threatened him from all sides, to keep the country under the yoke of fear and speechlessness and thus satisfy his own thirst for blood. This man was the bearer of a dark mission, which consisted of multiplying the suffering of the whole people, but his consciousness was flat and amystical, like a table, and the scope of his personality and talents was negligible. This was Maluta Skuratov of the 20th century.

Finally, the great moment arrived: Stalin passed away. Gashsharva trembled from this blow. Drukkarg resounded with screams of horror and anger. Zhrugr howled with rage and pain. Hordes of demons rose from the depths to the upper layers of the infracosmos, trying to slow down the descent of the dead into the abyss of magma.

The sorrowful frenzy spread to Enrof. The funeral of the leader, or rather, the transfer of his body to the mausoleum, turned into an idiotic gathering. The darkness of his name and deeds was so great that hundreds of thousands of people perceived his death as a calamity. Even in prison cells, some were crying about what would happen now. Crowds, who had never had the honor of seeing the leader during his lifetime, now thirsted to at least catch a glimpse of him in the coffin. Moscow resembled a picture of Bedlam, magnified to the size of a global city. Crowds flooded the entire center, trying to break through to the House of Unions, where the tyrant's body was put on display and from where the mourning procession was supposed to start. The adjacent streets turned into a Hodynka. People were dying, crushed against the walls of houses and lampposts, trampled underfoot, falling off the roofs of high-rise buildings, on which they tried to bypass the seething human mass below. It seemed as if he, who had fed on the vapors of suffering and blood all his life, even from beyond the grave, was pulling mountains of victims towards himself into the infracosmos.

He, who had always pushed away the thought of death, not even bothering to build a worthy tomb for himself, now had to lie in a sarcophagus next to the sarcophagus of his predecessor, and with his brain removed and his body impregnated with preserving compounds, become an object of worship for crowds and crowds. However, since he had to die, he wished for exactly such a strange form of rest. The emanation of human masses bowing down in reverence would infuse him with strength even in the afterlife, until the descent had not yet carried him too deeply. But mummification and the corresponding restructuring of the mausoleum required time, and time did not wait.

It is strange that no one at the time, after Lenin's death, paid serious attention to the magical, or rather, demonic nature of this never-before-used method of creating quasi-powers. They did not ponder how the creation of a center for a posthumous cult did not fit with the materialistic Doctrine, nor with the personal modesty of the first leader, nor with the entire psychological atmosphere of the revolutionary movement. The initiator of the creation of the mausoleum was the second leader. I do not know if he was then guided by unconscious intuition or if he already understood that at the moment when Lenin's brain was removed from his body, this very act severed the connection within the deceased's etheric body: this body was deprived of its life center and disintegrated, while the etheric brain of the deceased - the so-called racht - was picked up by the will of Urparp the Great Igvo Drukkarga and his assistants. There, in Drukkarga, the racht was placed and carefully preserved from decomposition in the cone of the main sanctuary, where the igvos maintained its potential life. If, after undergoing his redemptive trial in the lower layers, the first leader had ever reached Drukkarga, he would have taken his racht into himself as the center of his new etheric body. Among the anti-humanists, this would have thundered as the greatest miracle, the hero and miracle-worker would have been enthroned in Drukkarga, and this alone would have meant one more monolith for the unification of all strata in submissive Gagtungr than all the warlike undertakings of the Zhrugr.

But, after suffering in the Pit and in other layers, and reaching Drukkarga many years later, the first leader refused to accept his racht. Having been tempered by the terrible experience of the underworld, he realized what this threatened for him and for all humanity. Then the enraged Zhrugr dragged him down and threw him back onto the Pit. But he was already powerless to resist the forces of the Synclite in the further influence on the posthumous fate of the first leader, because the shelter of the deceased became open and accessible to them after he made his heroic choice. The one thrown onto the Pit was almost immediately lifted up rapidly, to Olirna, to be included in the creation of the blessed Arimoya - the forthcoming all-human metaproimage - after a series of years in the worlds of Enlightenment.

The first leader refused to accept his racht, but the second placed all his hopes on it. He, Urparp, and the demons from Gashsharva did everything in their power to slow down his karmic descent, in order to give the fledgling Gagtungr the opportunity to break through into the Russian shrastr and claim his racht. This slowing descent lasted for several months. For half a year, the forces of darkness fought against the action of the karmic load, which dragged the terrifying corpse down and down. They poured so much power into him that his voice thundered through all the purgatories, reached the shrastrs, and shook and trembled those who heard it even in Enrof. The most dangerous thing happened in Shim-big in October 1953. The falling one broke free from the guardians of karma. He was no longer recognizable in his human form, but was unimaginably terrible and powerful. His body consisted of brown lumps, and his huge eye sockets, which seemed blind, were almost all-seeing. Carried on the wings of angels of darkness, he soared to the gates of Drukkarg. Zhrugr hurried to help him, igvy and raruggi rejoiced in ecstatic delight.

There, by the walls of the Russian shrastr, one of the greatest battles was fought. The forces of the Synclite of Russia and its Demiurge proved to be insufficient. Angels, Daimons, and many enlightened beings from other metacultures rushed to their aid. For a while, the intruder was held back at the very entrance to Drukkarg by the great human spirit of the one who had been Abraham Lincoln on Earth. Finally, the sound of the galloping White Rider was heard, rushing from the heights of the Synclite of the World to here, to the shrastr. The usurper was enveloped in the will weapon of Alexander the Blessed and handed over to the guardians of karma. The scream that had shaken almost half of Shadanakar for so many days began to fade away until it ceased altogether. The one being lowered down embedded himself into super-heavy magmas and sank further and further down to the one-dimensional Pit.
