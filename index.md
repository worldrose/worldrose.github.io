## Book I. The Rose of the World and Its Place in History

### Chapter 1. The Rose of the World and Its Immediate Tasks

This book began at a time when an unprecedented disaster loomed over humanity, when a generation barely recovering from the shock of the Second World War was horrified to see a strange gloom gathering on the horizon, a harbinger of an even more menacing catastrophe, an even more devastating war. I began this book during the darkest years of tyranny that ruled over two hundred million people. I started it in a prison known as a political isolator, writing it in secret. I hid the manuscript and kind forces, both human and otherwise, kept it safe during searches. Every day, I expected the manuscript to be seized and destroyed, just as my previous work had been, which took ten years of my life and led me to political isolation.

The book "The Rose of the World" concludes several years later, when the danger of a third world war no longer looms like misty clouds on the horizon, but has spread over our heads, covering the zenith and rapidly descending from it down all sides of the sky. But maybe it will be averted? Such hope glimmers in the heart of everyone, and it would be impossible to live without such hope. Some try to reinforce it with logical arguments and active actions. Some manage to persuade themselves that the danger is exaggerated. Others try not to think about it at all, immersing themselves in the concerns of their small world and deciding once and for all: let whatever happens, happen. And there are those in whose soul the hope smolders as a dying spark, who live, move, and work only by inertia.

I am finishing the manuscript of "The Rose of the World" at liberty, in a golden autumn garden. The one under whose yoke the country had been exhausted is already reaping the fruits of what he has sown in other worlds. And yet, I hide the last pages of the manuscript just like I hid the first, and I dare not dedicate its content to any living soul, and I still have no confidence that the book will not be destroyed, that the spiritual experience with which it is saturated will be transmitted to anyone.

But perhaps it will be enough, and tyranny will never return? Perhaps humanity will forever keep the memory of Russia's terrible historical experience? Such hope is kindled in the heart of everyone, and without this hope, it would be nauseating to live.

But I belong to those who have been fatally wounded by two great disasters: world wars and solitary tyranny. Such people do not believe that the roots of wars and tyrannies have already been overcome in humanity or will be overcome in a short time. Perhaps the danger of this tyranny, this war, can be removed, but some time later the threat of the next one will arise. Both of these disasters were apocalypses for us - revelations of the power of world Evil and its eternal struggle with the forces of Light. People of other eras probably would not understand us; our anxiety would seem exaggerated to them, our worldview - painful. But such an understanding of historical regularities, which has been burned into human beings by half a century of contemplation and participation in events and processes of unprecedented scale, is not exaggerated. And that outcome, which has formed in the human soul as a result of the activity of its brightest and deepest sides, cannot be painful.

I am seriously ill, and the years of my life are counted. If the manuscript is destroyed or lost, I will not have time to restore it. But if it reaches at least a few people someday whose spiritual thirst will compel them to read it to the end, overcoming all its difficulties, the ideas laid out in it cannot help but become seeds, giving rise to shoots in other hearts.

And whether this will happen before the third world war or after it, or whether the third war will not be unleashed in the coming years at all - the book will not die anyway if at least one friendly pair of eyes passes, chapter by chapter, through its pages. Because the questions it tries to answer will still concern people in the distant future.

These questions are not exhausted by the issues of war and state structure. However, nothing shakes my conviction that the most terrifying dangers that threaten humanity now and will continue to threaten for many centuries are the great suicidal war and absolute worldwide tyranny. Perhaps in our era, humanity will surpass or at least survive the third world war, as it did in the first and second. Perhaps it will endure, somehow, a tyranny even more extensive and merciless than the one we endured. It is also possible that in a hundred or two hundred years, new dangers for peoples will arise that are no less deadly than tyranny and the great war, but different. It is possible. Probable. But no effort of reason, no imagination or intuition can depict the impending dangers that would not be in some way connected with one of the two main ones: the danger of the physical destruction of humanity due to war and the danger of its spiritual death due to absolute worldwide tyranny.

The book is aimed primarily against these two evils. Two fundamental, primary evils. It is aimed against them not as a pamphlet, not as an exposing satire, not as a sermon. The most scorching satire and the most fiery sermon are fruitless if they only lash out at evil and prove that good is good and bad is bad. They are fruitless if they are not based on knowledge of the foundations of that worldview, that universal doctrine and that effective program that, spreading from mind to mind and from will to will, would be capable of turning these two fundamental dangers away from humanity. To share my experience with others, to open up the picture of historical and meta-historical perspectives, the branching chain of dilemmas facing us or likely to arise, the panorama of different material worlds, closely interrelated with us in good and evil - that is the task of my life. I sought and seek to fulfill it in the forms of verbal art, in prose and poetry, but the peculiarities of this art did not allow me to reveal the entire concept with the necessary completeness, to present it exhaustively, clearly, and accessibly. To unfold this concept precisely in this way, to make it understood how it, interpreting the supernatural, at the same time holds the key to both the current processes of history and the fate of each of us - that is the task of this book. A book that, if the Lord preserves it from destruction, must be inserted, like one of many bricks, into the foundation of the Rose of the World, into the basis of all-human Brotherhood.

There is an institution that has claimed for centuries to be the sole unswerving unifier of people, preventing them from the danger of a war of all against all, the danger of falling into chaos. Such an institution is the state. Since the end of the clan system, the state has been an essential necessity at every historical stage. Even hierocracies, attempting to replace it with religious power, turned into varieties of the same State. The state cemented society on the basis of violence, and the level of moral development necessary to cement society on some other principle has not been achieved. Of course, it has not been achieved to this day. The state still remains the only proven means against social chaos. However, the existence of higher ethical principles in humanity, capable not only of maintaining but also improving social harmony, is becoming clear. What is even more important, paths of accelerated development of these principles are emerging.

In the political history of modern times, two polar directions can be easily distinguished. One of them aims at the further development of the state principle as such, at strengthening the comprehensive dependence of the individual on the state, more precisely, on the entity that controls the state apparatus: parties, armies, leaders. States of the fascist or national-socialist type are the brightest examples of such phenomena. The other stream of events, which emerged already in the 18th century, if not earlier, is the stream of humanistic orientation. Its origins and main stages are English parliamentarianism, the French Declaration of Human Rights, the German Social Democracy, and finally, the liberation struggle against colonialism. The ultimate goal of this stream of events is to weaken the cementing violence in the lives of peoples and transform the state from a predominantly police apparatus defending national or class domination into an apparatus of universal economic balance and protection of individual rights. There are still original formations in historical reality that may appear as hybrids. Essentially remaining phenomena of the first type, they alter their own appearance to the extent that it is appropriate to achieve the set goal. This is only tactics, masking, nothing more.

Despite the polarity of these streams of phenomena, they are united by one characteristic that is most typical of the 20th century: a striving towards the universal. The external pathos of various movements of our era is expressed in their constructive programs for national organization; but the internal driving force of modern history is a spontaneous urge towards the universal.

The most powerful movement of the first half of our century was distinguished by the internationalism of its doctrine and the planetary scale of its aspirations. The Achilles' heel of the movements that opposed it - racism and national socialism - was their narrow nationalism, or rather, the narrow racial or national borders of the blissful zones that they tempted and mesmerized. However, they too sought world domination, and with tremendous energy. Now, cosmopolitan Americanism is preoccupied with avoiding the mistakes of its predecessors.

What does this sign of the times indicate? Does it not point to the fact that universality, which used to be an abstract idea, has become a universal necessity? Does it not suggest that the world has become indivisible and cramped as never before? Does it not imply that a radical and lasting solution to all urgent problems can only be achieved on a universal scale?

Despotic regimes systematically implement the principle of extreme violence, or cleverly combine methods to veil it. The pace is accelerating. Such colossal states are emerging that would have taken centuries to construct in the past. Each, being predatory in its nature, strives to impose its own power on humanity. Their military and technological power is becoming dizzying. They have already plunged the world into the abyss of wars and tyranny so many times - what guarantees are there that they will not do it again and again? And finally, the strongest will prevail on a global scale, even if it means turning a third of the planet into a lunar landscape. Then the cycle will end, giving way to the greatest of all evils: a single dictatorship over the surviving two thirds of the world - first, perhaps, oligarchic, and then, as is usually the case in the second stage of dictatorships, autocratic. This is the most terrifying threat of all that hangs over humanity: the threat of a universal tyranny.

Consciously or unconsciously sensing this danger, movements of humanistic orientation are trying to consolidate their efforts. They babble about cultural cooperation, wave pacifist and democratic freedom slogans, seek illusory salvation in neutrality, or, frightened by the aggressiveness of the enemy, themselves take his path. None of them has put forward the indisputable goal, namely the idea that ethical control is urgently necessary over the activities of states. Some societies, traumatized by the horrors of world wars, are trying to unite in order to subsequently embrace the whole earth in a political union. But what would that lead to now? The danger of wars, true, would be eliminated, at least temporarily. But where are the guarantees that this superstate, relying on extensive morally backward layers - and there are much more of them in the world than one would like - and stirring up the not yet eradicated instincts of ambition and torment in humanity, will not turn into a dictatorship and, finally, into a tyranny that will make all previous ones look like a joke?

It is significant that it is precisely religious denominations that were the first to proclaim the international ideals of brotherhood, which now find themselves in the rearguard of the general trend towards a universal. Perhaps this is due to their characteristic concentration on the inner man, disregard for everything external, and the external also includes the problem of the social organization of humanity. But if you look deeper, if you say out loud what is usually only said in narrow circles of people living an intensive religious life, something will be revealed that not everyone takes into account. This is the mystical horror that arose in the days of the ancient Roman Empire in anticipation of the coming unification of the world, this is an insatiable anxiety for humanity, because a trap is felt in a single universal state, from where the only way out will be to absolute despotism, to the kingdom of "the prince of this world", to the last cataclysms of history and its catastrophic break.

And indeed, where are the guarantees that at the head of this super-state will not be a great ambitious person, and science will serve him faithfully and truthfully as a tool for turning this super-state into that monstrous machine of torture and spiritual mutilation that I am talking about? Can there be any doubt that even now there are prerequisites for inventing perfect control over people's behavior and their way of thinking? What are the limits of those nightmarish perspectives that arise before our imagination as a result of the intersection of two factors: terrorist dictatorship and 21st-century technology? Tyranny will be all the more absolute as then there will be no last, tragic path of liberation: the crushing of tyranny from the outside as a result of military defeat - there will be no one left to fight, everyone will be subservient. And the world unity, dreamed of by so many generations, demanding so many sacrifices, will turn into its demonic side: its hopelessness in the event that the leadership of this unity is taken by adherents of dark forces.

On bitter experience, humanity is already convinced that neither the socio-economic movements whose leadership is taken up by bare reason nor the achievements of science itself are capable of leading humanity between Scylla and Charybdis – tyrannies and world wars.

Worse yet, new socio-economic systems, when they come to power, themselves become adorned with mechanisms of political despotism, becoming the sowers and instigators of world wars. Science becomes their obedient servant, far more obedient and reliable than the church was for feudal lords. The tragedy lies in the fact that scientific activity from the very beginning was not coupled with deeply thought-out moral education. All were admitted to this activity regardless of their level of moral development. It is not surprising that every success of science and technology now turns against the true interests of humanity. The internal combustion engine, radio, aviation, atomic energy – all strike at the living flesh of peoples with one end. And the development of means of communication and technical achievements that allow the police regime to monitor the intimate life and secret thoughts of each person bring an iron base under the vampiric piles of dictatorships.

Thus, the experience of history brings humanity to the understanding of the obvious fact that dangers will be prevented and social harmony achieved not by the development of science and technology themselves, not by the overdevelopment of the state element, not by the dictatorship of the "strong man," not by the coming to power of pacifist organizations of the social-democratic type, rocked by historical winds from powerlessness and idealism to revolutionary maximalism – but by recognizing the urgent need for one and only path: the establishment of some untainted, incorruptible, highly authoritative institution over the World Federation of States, an ethical, non-state and supranational institution, because the nature of the state is unethical by its very essence.

What idea, what doctrine will help create such control? What minds will develop it and make it acceptable to the vast majority? By what means will such an institution come to universal recognition, to a height dominating even the Federation of States – rejecting violence? But if it takes as a guiding principle the gradual replacement of violence with something else, then what exactly and in what sequence? And what doctrine will be able to resolve all the emerging problems with their incredible complexity?

This passage is from a book that aims to answer certain questions, although its overall theme is wider. Before providing an answer, it is important to clearly formulate what this doctrine sees as its greatest enemy and what it is directed against.

In historical terms, it sees its enemies in any state, party, or doctrine that seeks to violently enslave others and any form of despotic governance. In a meta-historical sense, its enemy is one thing: the spirit of tyranny, the Great Tormentor, manifesting itself in various ways throughout the history of our planet. For the movement being discussed, both now, when it is barely emerging, and later, when it becomes the decisive voice of history, the enemy will be one thing: the desire for tyranny and cruel violence, wherever it arises, even within the movement itself. Violence can only be considered justifiable to the extent of extreme necessity, only in softened forms and only until the highest authority, through improved education, prepares humanity to replace coercion with voluntariness, the external voice of law with the voice of a deep conscience, and states with brotherhood. In other words, until the essence of the state is transformed, and a living brotherhood replaces the soulless apparatus of state violence.

It is not necessary to assume that such a process will necessarily take a huge amount of time. Historical experience of great dictatorships, which covered huge countries with an extraordinary energy and consistency of a carefully planned system of education and upbringing, has convincingly demonstrated the leverage of this method of influencing generations' mentality. Generations were formed closer and closer to what was desirable for the ruling authorities. Nazi Germany, for example, managed to achieve its goals even in the eyes of one generation. Of course, nothing but anger and disgust can evoke its ideals in us. Not only its ideals - even its methodology must be almost completely rejected by us. But the lever it has opened must be taken in our hands and firmly grasped. The century of the triumph of broad spiritual enlightenment and decisive achievements of a new, barely emerging pedagogy is approaching. If at least a few dozen schools were entrusted to it, a generation capable of fulfilling its duty not by coercion, but by free will, not out of fear, but out of creative impulse and love would be formed there. This is the essence of the education of a person of an ennobled type.

It seems to me that an international organization, political and cultural, aiming at transforming the essence of the state through the consistent implementation of all-encompassing reforms, should be created. The decisive step towards this goal is the creation of a World Federation of States as independent members, but with a special body established over the Federation that controls the activities of states and directs their bloodless and painless transformation from within. It is precisely bloodless and painless - that is what it is all about, that is what distinguishes it from past revolutionary doctrines.

What the structure of this organization will be, what its name will be - it seems premature and unnecessary to predict. Let us conditionally call it, so as not to repeat lengthy descriptions each time, the League for the Transformation of the Essence of the State. As for its structure, those who will become its organizers will be more experienced and practical than I am: they will be public figures, not poets. I can only say that personally, it seems to me that the League should have its branches in all countries, and each branch should have several aspects: cultural, philanthropic, educational, and political. Such a political aspect of each branch will structurally and organizationally transform into a national party of the World Religious and Cultural Reform.

I do not know how, where, and among whom the formation of the League will take place, and I cannot know. But it is clear that the period from its inception until the creation of a federation of states and an ethical institution above them should be considered a preparatory period, a period when the League will devote all its efforts to the dissemination of its ideas, the formation of its ranks, the expansion of the organization, the education of the younger generation, and the creation within itself of that future institution to which the world leadership role may eventually be entrusted.

The League's charter cannot prevent people of different philosophical and religious beliefs from joining its ranks. All that is required is a willingness to actively participate in implementing its program and a determination not to violate its moral principles, which are accepted as the cornerstone.

In all the vicissitudes of social life and political struggle, the successes of the League must be achieved not by deviating from its moral code, but precisely because of its adherence to it. Its reputation must be unblemished, its selflessness beyond doubt, and its authority growing, because the best forces of humanity will gather in it and continuously strengthen it.

Most likely, the path to global unity will lie through a ladder of various stages of international solidarity, through the union and merger of regional communities. The final step of this ladder is represented by a global referendum or plebiscite - some form of free expression of will of all. Perhaps it will lead to the victory of the League only in certain countries. But the historical course of events will be on its side. The unification of at least half of the globe will complete a profound shift in the consciousness of peoples. A second referendum will take place, maybe a third, and a decade earlier or later the boundaries of the Federation will coincide with the boundaries of humanity. Then a practical opportunity will arise to carry out a chain of broad measures aimed at transforming the conglomerate of states into a monolith, gradually transformed by two parallel processes: external - political, social, and economic, and internal - educational, ethical, and religious.

It is clear from all this that the leaders of the League and its national parties will be able to fight only with words and their own example, and only with those ideologies and doctrines that seek to clear the way for any dictatorships or support these dictatorships at the levers of power. The League will see its historical predecessors in the great Mahatma Gandhi and the party inspired by him, although they acted on a narrow national scale. The first statesman-righteous in modern history, he established a purely political movement based on high ethics and refuted the prevailing opinion that politics and morality are incompatible.

But the national boundaries within which the Indian National Congress acted will be expanded by the League to planetary boundaries, and its goals will be the next historical step or series of steps compared to those set by the great party that liberated India.

Oh, of course there will be many people who will claim that the League's methodology is impractical and unrealistic. Oh, how I despise these advocates of political realism! There is no immorality, no social repulsiveness that has not been covered by this pathetic fig leaf. There is no weight more deadly, more grounding, than talk of political realism as a counterweight to everything winged, everything inspiring, everything spiritual. Political realists, among other things, are those who once claimed, even in India itself, that Gandhi was a fantasist and a dreamer. They had to grit their teeth and bite their tongues when Gandhi and his party, precisely on the path of high ethics, achieved the country's liberation and led it further towards prosperity. Not towards external prosperity that blinds people with black dust from figures on coal production growth or radioactive ash from experimental hydrogen bomb explosions, but towards cultural, ethical, and aesthetic prosperity - spiritual prosperity that slowly but surely pulls material prosperity along with it. Those who are unable to see the best in human beings, whose psyche has become coarse and whose conscience has become dull in an atmosphere of rough state tyranny, will also accuse the League of being unrealistic in its methods. They will be joined by those who do not foresee the shifts in mass consciousness that await us in the near years. The trauma of wars, repressions, and all sorts of violence still evokes a broad movement for coexistence and peace. Events constantly occur and will occur that destroy the sense of security, leaving nothing of comfort and peace, undermining the roots of trust in existing ideologies and the order of things they protect. The exposure of unheard-of horrors perpetrated behind pompous dictatorships, the vivid realization of what their temporary victories were erected on and what they were paid for - all this parches the soul like scorching wind, and the thirst for spirituality becomes unbearable. About the removal of the threat of great wars; about the paths to uniting the world without bloodshed; about the light-bearer and righteous one who is coming to lead humanity; about the weakening of state violence and the growth of the spirit of brotherhood - this is what the faithful pray for and what the non-believers dream of in our time. And it is highly probable that the all-encompassing winged doctrine - moral, political, philosophical, and religious - will embody this generation's thirst for an all-national creative enthusiasm.

The fact that the last major religious movement in humanity, the Protestant Reformation, took place four hundred years ago, while the last global religion, Islam, has already existed for thirteen centuries, is sometimes put forward as an argument in favor of the opinion that the religious era in humanity has ended. However, the potential possibilities of religion as such, and not of its separate forms, should be judged not by how long its last major forms emerged, but by whether the evolution of religion has reached a dead end, whether it is possible to combine religious creative thought with indisputable scientific theses, and also by whether there are prospects for understanding the material of new epochs with such a worldview and whether religion can have a effective and progressive impact on this material.

Indeed, about four hundred years have passed since the last major international religious movement. But weren't there few such movements before the Protestant Reformation? And is that the point? Isn't it already clear that a certain channel of humanity's ideological and creative work in recent centuries has absorbed almost all its spiritual and intellectual forces? It would be difficult to expect that while achieving such rapid progress - scientific, technical, and social, creating such cultural values as literature, music, philosophy, art, and science in recent centuries, humanity would also find the strength to simultaneously create universal religious systems.

The turn of the 20th century marked the end of the flourishing of great literature, art, music, and philosophy. The realm of social and political action increasingly involves not the most spiritual representatives of humanity, but rather the least spiritual, and this trend is becoming more pronounced. A huge spiritual vacuum has formed that did not exist even fifty years ago, and hypertrophied science is powerless to fill it. If I may use this expression, the colossal resources of human genius are not being utilized anywhere. This is the womb of creative forces in which the predetermined birth of a universal inter-religion is maturing.

Will religion be able to prevent the most ominous dangers that threaten humanity, not in its old forms, but in the religion of the future, which the world is now pregnant with: world wars and world tyranny? It is probably unable to prevent the imminent world war; if a third war breaks out, this disaster will likely occur before even the League can emerge. But preventing all wars, the dangers of which will arise after the nucleus of the forthcoming inter-religion is formed, as well as preventing world tyranny, is its immediate goal. Can this religion achieve the greatest harmony between personal freedom and the interests of humanity, which is only imaginable at this stage of history? But this is just another aspect of its immediate goal. Will it contribute to the comprehensive development of the creative abilities inherent in humans, except for demonic abilities, which are the abilities to tyrannize, torture, and assert oneself at the expense of other living beings? Yes. Does it require bloody sacrifices for its triumph, like other world-oriented movements? No, except in cases where its preachers may have to testify to their loyalty to the idea with their own blood. Do its theses contradict the objective and universally binding theses of modern science, not the philosophical doctrine of materialism (which they, of course, contradict in all respects from A to Z)? Not in a single letter or number. Can we foresee the establishment of a regime in the era of its hegemony where dissent will be persecuted, and where it will impose its dogmas on philosophy, science, and art? On the contrary, from partial restrictions on freedom of thought at first, to unlimited freedom of thought later, that is the path it proposes. What remains of the argument that religion is incapable of answering pressing questions of the time, let alone practically resolving them?

With full right and reason, such reproach can be thrown not at religion, but unfortunately at science. It is precisely the system of views that does not look beyond the boundaries of what is circumscribed by modern scientific knowledge, neither to the right nor to the left, that is incapable of answering the most fundamental, most elementary questions. - Does the First Cause, Creator, God exist? Unknown. - Does the soul or something similar to it exist, and is it immortal? Science does not know this. - What is time, space, matter, energy? Opinions sharply diverge on this. - Is the world eternal and infinite, or, on the contrary, limited in time and space? Science does not have the material for a solid answer to these questions. - Why should I do good and not evil if I like evil and can protect myself from punishment? The answers are completely incomprehensible. - How to use science to prevent the possibility of wars and tyrannies? Silence. - How to achieve social harmony with the least number of victims? Mutually exclusive proposals are put forward, similar only in one thing: that they all are equally unrelated to strict science. Naturally, on such shaky, subjective, truly pseudo-scientific foundations, teachings of class, racial, national, and party egoism arose, that is, precisely those whose vocation is to justify dictatorships and wars. Low spirituality is a characteristic feature of such teachings. Therefore, the sought-after ethical instance can be built not on the so-called scientific worldview - which, in fact, does not exist - but on participation in the spiritual world, on the perception of rays flowing from there into the heart, mind, and conscience, and on the implementation of the covenant of active and creative love in all spheres of life. The moral level, fully corresponding to the enumerated characteristics, is called righteousness.

Another prejudice is also widespread: the view of religion as a reactionary phenomenon by its very nature, especially in our era. However, to speak of the reactionariness or obsolescence of religion in general, regardless of its specific forms, is as meaningless as proving the reactionariness of art or philosophy in general. Those who think dynamically, who see evolving series of facts and processes that shape these series, can discern reactionary and progressive forms in art, religion, and any area of human activity. Reactive forms of religion can be encountered as much as one would like, and even more than one would like, but this has no bearing on the emerging religion of the outcome to which this book is dedicated. For in our century, there have been and are no more progressive goals or methods than those united with this religion. As for claims of scientific method to some sort of superiority, the scientific method is just as powerless to supplant artistic and religious methods in the broad sense of the word, as aggressive religiosity was unable to do so in its time. Because these methods differ not only in how they do things but also in what they know. In the past century, under the influence of rapid progress in science and technology, the death of art was prophesied. A hundred years have passed, and the flowering of the arts has not only not died, but has been enriched by one more: the art of cinema. Forty or thirty years ago, the inevitable demise of religion in Russia due to scientific and social progress seemed to many. However, the flowering of religions not only did not die, despite all the means mobilized for this purpose, but it is precisely under the influence of scientific and social progress that it is enriched by what will make world religiosity a complete and unified spiritual flower - the Rose of the World.

From all that has been said, it follows that a religious movement that includes in its worldview and practice the positive experience of humanity and draws conclusions from the negative that require too much courage and integrity to be made on the paths of other trends in public thought; a movement that places transformation of the state into a brotherhood, the unification of the earth, and the education of a refined human being as its immediate goals; a movement that will protect itself from the distortion of the ideal and methodology with the unbreakable armor of high morality - such a movement cannot but be recognized as progressive, prospective, and creatively young.

Armor of morality! But on what basis can such morality be created? I spoke about righteousness. But is not righteousness the utopia of entire social circles, not individuals?

It should be clarified what is meant here by righteousness. Righteousness is not necessarily the fruit of monastic asceticism. Righteousness is the highest stage of a person's moral development; one who has surpassed it is no longer righteous but a saint. The forms of righteousness, however, are diverse; they depend on time, place, and human character. One can say in general: righteousness - in its negative aspect - is such a state of a person, stable and ending only with their death, in which their will is freed from impulses of self-love, reason - from captivity by material interests, and the heart - from the boiling of random, murky, soul-degrading emotions. In the positive aspect, righteousness is the penetration of active love for God, people, and the world into all external and internal activities of a person.

The psychological climate for the emergence of a moral authority based on righteousness is unlikely to be prepared better anywhere than in a society united in the hope of its emergence and seeing its meaning and purpose in this. But it is precisely such a society that should be the League. Among its members may even be atheists. But the League's main thesis is the necessity of a worldwide ethical authority above states, and it is this that will unite the most inspired, creative, active, and talented members into its core. A core characterized by an atmosphere of constant spiritual creativity, active love, and purity. A core consisting of people who are enlightened enough to understand not only the danger threatening each of them due to the unbridled impulses of self, but also the danger of too external a understanding of religious and moral values, which leads to ethical formalism, hypocrisy, spiritual callousness, and sanctimoniousness.

No one but the Lord God knows where and when the first flame of the Rose of the World will ignite. The country - Russia - is only indicated; tragic events that complicate the performance of this mystical act and force it to be postponed to another country are still possible. The era - the 1960s of our century - is only outlined; deadly cataclysms that will push this date far into the future are possible. Perhaps the environment where the first flame ignites will not be the League for the transformation of the essence of the state, but another, as yet unpredictable circle of people. But whether there or here, in this country or another, earlier or later by a decade, the interreligious, all-human church of the new times, the Rose of the World, will appear as the result of the spiritual activity of many, as the collective creativity of people who have become recipients of a pouring stream of revelation - it will emerge, arise, and enter onto the historical path.

Religion, inter-religion, church - I cannot achieve the necessary precision using any of these words. A number of its fundamental differences from old religions and churches will eventually compel the use of different words in reference to it. But even without that, the introduction of this book requires the use of such an extensive range of new words that it is preferable, at the very beginning, to resort not to these words, but to a descriptive definition of the distinctive features of what should be called the Rose of the World.

This is not a closed religious denomination, true or false. This is not an international religious society like Theosophical, Anthroposophical or Masonic, composed, like a bouquet, of individual colors of religious truths, eclectically gathered in all sorts of religious meadows. This is an inter-religion or pan-religion in the sense that it should be understood as a universal teaching that points to such a perspective on previously arisen religions, in which they all turn out to be reflections of different layers of spiritual reality, different series of immaterial facts, different segments of the planetary cosmos. This perspective embraces Shambhala as a whole and as part of the divine cosmos of the universe. If old religions are petals, then the Rose of the World is a flower: with roots, stem, cup, and all the community of its petals.

The second difference is the universality of the aspirations of the Rose of the World and their historical concreteness. No religion, except medieval Catholicism, ever set itself the task of transforming the social body of humanity. However, the papacy, which stubbornly sought to contain the feudal chaos with the dams of hierocracy, failed to weaken the exploitation of the poor by the rich, reduce social inequality through sweeping reforms, or increase general prosperity. However, it would be unfair to blame the leading Catholic hierarchy for this: there were no material means, neither economic nor technical, for such transformations. The evil of the world was felt from time immemorial and remained ineradicable until modern times, and Catholicism, in essence, like all other religions, addressed only the "inner man" and taught personal improvement. But times have changed, material means have appeared, and the merit of the entire historical process, rather than the Rose of the World itself, is that it can now view social transformations not as external, doomed to failure and not worthy of effort, but in an inseparable connection with the improvement of the inner world of man: now these are two parallel processes that must complement each other. One often hears, "Christianity failed." Yes, if it were all in the past, it could be said that in social and universal-moral terms it had not succeeded. "Religion failed." Yes, if religious creativity of humanity had exhausted itself with what had already been created, religion in the aforementioned sense would indeed have failed. But for now, it is only fair to say that the old religions could not achieve a significant reduction in social evil because they did not have the necessary material means, and the absence of these means provoked their negative attitude towards all such attempts. This prepared the way for the irreligious stage of civilization. In the 18th century, social consciousness awakened. Social disharmony was finally felt and recognized as something unacceptable, offensive, and requiring overcoming. Of course, this was connected with the fact that material means began to appear. But the old religions did not understand this, did not want to use these means, did not wish to lead the process of social transformation, and it is in this narrow-mindedness, intellectual laziness, and ideological immobility that their heaviest guilt lies. Religion discredited itself with centuries of helplessness in this regard, so it is not surprising that Europe and then other continents fell into the opposite extreme of transforming society purely by mechanical means while completely rejecting the spiritual side of the same process. It is no wonder, of course, that the outcome was upheavals such as the world had never seen, scales of victims that had never even been imagined, and such a lowering of the ethical level that the very possibility of which in the 20th century still seems to many a dark and tragic mystery. Old religions bear a significant responsibility for the depth and persistence of the subsequent irreligious stage, for the spiritual fate of millions of souls who, in the struggle for a just world order, opposed religion in general and thereby uprooted the roots of their existence from the womb of world spirituality. But true religious activity is a kind of public service, and true public service is at the same time religious activity. No religious act, not even the feat of a monk, can be isolated from the general work for the benefit of universal enlightenment; and no social activity, except for demonic ones, can fail to influence the increase in the sum of world good, that is, not have a religious meaning. The beating of social conscience, effective social compassion and rejoicing, incessant practical efforts to transform the social body of mankind - these are the second differences of the Rose of the World from ancient religions.

The third difference is the dynamism of its views. Religions that are not alien to meta-history, such as Judaism and early Christianity, existed, but only in distant and short periods of their development did they attempt to spiritually comprehend the current historical process. In those short, half-forgotten epochs, the striking insights of the Apocalypse remained covered from people's eyes by a veil of innuendos and insinuations; the cipher of images allowed for all sorts of interpretations. True understanding of the historical process never took place. The historical experience was still small and narrow, the geographic horizon was negligible, the mystical mind was not prepared to grasp the internal laws of meta-history and the incredible complexity of Shadanakar. But the era of the hegemony of science preceded the phenomenon of the Rose of the World, shaking up the conception of the universe, nations, cultures, and their destiny at the very root. It was also preceded by another thing: an era of radical shifts and upheavals in society, an era of revolutions and planetary wars. Both series of phenomena stirred up psychological strata that had been stagnant for so many centuries. Seeds of meta-historical revelation fall into the soil torn up by the iron teeth of historical catastrophes. And the planetary cosmos(^1) opens up to spiritual vision as an ever-changing system of worlds with multiple meanings, rushing towards a dazzling goal, becoming spiritualized and transformed from century to century, from day to day. Rows of upcoming epochs begin to shine through, each with its own unique characteristics and a combination of meta-historical elements struggling within it. The aim of the Rose of the World is to become a receiver, multiplier, and interpreter of this knowledge. As the mystical collective mind of humanity, she will comprehend the historical process in its past, present, and future in order to enter into creative leadership of it. If it is possible to speak of any dogmas in her teachings, then it is a deeply dynamic, multi-aspect, and capable of further enrichment and development, of long-term improvement.

____________
(^1): By planetary cosmos is meant the totality of layers of various materiality, of different spatial and temporal coordinates, but invariably connected with the sphere of the Earth as a planet. The planetary cosmos is the earthly sphere in all the complexity of its material (not just physical) layers of existence. Similar powerful systems exist for many celestial bodies. They are called brahmaturas. The brahmatura of the Earth is named Shadanakar. As for these words, like many others used here for the first time or changed in meaning with new implications, it is worth looking at a small dictionary attached at the end.

From this follows another, fourth, distinction of the Rose of the World: the perspective of consecutive spiritual-historical tasks, which are quite specific and fundamentally achievable. I will list again the nearest ones: the unification of the Earth into a Federation of states with an ethical controlling body over it, the spread of material prosperity and a high cultural level to the population of all countries, the upbringing of generations in an ennobled image, the reunification of Christian churches and a free union with all religions of a bright direction, the transformation of the planet into a garden and states into brotherhood. But these are only first priority tasks. Their implementation will open the way to solving even higher tasks: the spiritualization of nature.

So, interreligiousness, the universality of social aspirations and their specificity, the dynamism of views and the sequence of world-historical tasks - these are the features that distinguish the Rose of the World from all religions and churches of the past. The bloodlessness of its paths, the painlessness of its reforms, kindness and tenderness towards people, waves of emotional warmth spreading around - these are the features that distinguish it from all political and social movements of the past and present.

It is clear that the essence of the state, as well as the ethical character of society, cannot be transformed in an instant. A complete rejection of coercion from the outset is a utopia. However, this element will diminish over time and in public space. Every discipline consists of elements of coercion and consciousness, and the proportion between these two elements determines the type of discipline. The discipline of slave economies, prisons, and concentration camps has the highest percentage of coercion and almost no consciousness. A little more consciousness is present in military drill. And as the element of coercion weakens in disciplinary systems, the categorical imperative of self-discipline will replace it. The entire new pedagogy will be based on cultivating this impulse. The principles and methods of this pedagogy, as well as the methods of re-educating and rehabilitating criminals, will be discussed in one of the last chapters. But it is already clear, it seems, that the stimulus of external coercion will rapidly diminish in the inner concentric circles of the Rose of the World. For it will be these people, who have completely fused their lives with its tasks and ethics, and who no longer need external coercion, who will fill these inner circles. It is precisely these people who will be its conscience, and who else but them should occupy the seats of the Supreme Council?

And can we overestimate the educational value of such social structures, when at the top of society there are leaders who create and act with the greatest dignity: not those whose willpower is hypertrophied at the expense of other faculties of the soul and whose strength lies in an indiscriminate attitude towards means, but those in whom harmoniously developed will, reason, love, purity of thoughts, and deep life experience are combined with obvious spiritual gifts - those whom we call righteous people. Quite recently we saw an example of this: we saw the fateful hour of India and the great soul Gandhi. We saw an amazing spectacle: a man who had no state power, under whose authority there was not a single soldier, not even a personal servant, who had no roof over his head and walked in a loincloth, became the conscience, the spiritual and political leader of three hundred million people, and one of his quiet words was enough to unite these millions in a common bloodless struggle for the liberation of their country, and the shedding of the enemy's blood led to a nationwide fast and mourning. It is easy to imagine how tragically distorted the historical path of the Indian people would have been if, instead of this activist at the decisive moment, a person of a one-sided willful type had emerged as the leader, like Mussolini or Stalin, a so-called "strong personality", a master of demagogy and political intrigue, masking his despotism with tirades about the public good! How brilliantly he would have played on the lowest instincts of the people, on their natural hatred of conquerors, on envy of the rich; what waves of fire and blood would have swept over India, flooding the islands of high ethical consciousness, which for thousands of years were strengthened and cherished by the best sons of the great nation! And what tyranny would have been erected in the end over the tortured country, using the tendency to obedience created by centuries of slavery! Gandhi directed the liberating and creative enthusiasm of the nation along a different path. Here is the first example in modern history of that force which will gradually replace the sword and the whip of state power. This force is the living trust of the people in those who have proved their moral height; this is the authority of righteousness.

I anticipate many objections. One of them is as follows: yes, this was possible in India, with its unique characteristics, four-thousand-year-old religious history, and the ethical level of its people. Other nations have different legacies, and India's experience cannot be transferred to any other country. It is true that every nation has its own legacy. And India's legacy led its people to become pioneers on this path. But almost every nation has seen dictatorships and tyrannies of various hues, diverse ideological camouflage, and each one could see the abyss into which blind power, unenlightened righteousness, and not even meeting the demands of the average moral level, were leading the country. And yet, state leadership is a feat, and the average moral level is too small for that. Many peoples have seen this too because where instead of dictators, political parties alternate, there diplomats and generals, bosses and lawyers, demagogues and businessmen change, some are more selfish, others more ideological, but none can breathe new, pure, and fervent spirit into life, or solve urgent national problems. Nobody can trust any of them more than themselves because none of them even thought about what righteousness and spirituality is. These are wandering shadows, fallen leaves caught by the winds of history. If the Rose of the World does not come onto the world stage in time, they will be scattered by the fiery breath of willful and ruthless dictatorships. But if the Rose of the World appears, they will dissolve, melt under the rising sun of the great idea because people's hearts trust one righteous person more than a hundred contemporary politicians. But even more powerful and brighter will be the impact on the people and their destiny if the three highest gifts - righteousness, the gift of religious preaching, and artistic genius - are combined in one person.

Many, oh so many manifestations of religion relate entirely to its past stages. One such manifestation, apparently, is the power over the minds of strictly defined, apodictic, undeveloped, statuary dogmas. The experience of the last centuries and the growth of personality have led to the fact that man feels the conditionality and narrowness of any dogmatism. Therefore, no matter how un-dogmatic the theses of the Rose of the World may be, no matter how permeated with the spirit of religious dynamics they are, many will still struggle to accept them. But many, many will respond to its call, as long as it is addressed not so much to the intellect as to the heart, sounding in the genius creations of words, music, theater, architecture. Artistic images are more vivid and multi-aspectual than the aphorisms of theosophy or philosophical reasoning. They leave more freedom to the imagination, they allow each person to interpret the doctrine in a way that is more organic and understandable for their individuality. Revelation flows along many channels, and art - if not the purest, then the broadest of them. Therefore, all kinds of art and the beautiful cult will dress the Rose of the World in sounding and shining covers. And that is why the most natural leader of the Rose of the World is the one who has combined three greatest gifts: the gift of religious preaching, the gift of righteousness, and the gift of artistic genius. Perhaps such a person will not come or will not come soon. Perhaps the Rose of the World will be led not by him, but by a collective of the most worthy. But if Providence directed such a great soul to our century - and It already has - and the demonic forces could not eliminate it, it would be the greatest happiness for the whole earth. Because no one can have a more powerful and luminous influence on humanity than the influence of a genius word artist who has become a spiritual leader and righteous person and has been raised to the heights of world leadership by social and cultural achievements. It is only such a person who can be entrusted with the extraordinary and unprecedented task in history: ethical control over all the states of the Federation and the leadership of the peoples on the path of transforming these states into a universal brotherhood.

Oh, we Russians have paid a heavy price for our unconditional trust in a strong person, who many of us have taken for a benefactor of humanity. Let us not repeat this mistake! There are unmistakable signs that distinguish a person worthy of such a mission from an evil genius of the nation. The latter is gloomy, while the former is joyful in spiritual merriment. One strengthens their power through executions and punishments, while the other will never seek power in their lifetime and, when they do assume it, will not spill anyone's blood. One propagates the cult of their personality, which is under their control, throughout the land; the other finds it repulsive and comical. One is inaccessible, the other is open to all. One is consumed by an insatiable thirst for life and power, and hides behind impenetrable walls of imaginary danger; the other is free from the temptations of life, and in the face of danger, they are calm because their conscience is pure and their faith unshakable. These are two antipodes, messengers of two irreconcilable principles.

Of course, in the Supreme Council, such a chosen one would only be the first among equals. They would rely on the cooperation of the multitude in everything, and their own activity would be controllable by this multitude. They could only come to this extraordinary position through a strict selection process. Such a position cannot be held by youth or even middle age, only by old age. Temptations and struggles of passions must have long been overcome. As for the election itself, it seems to me that it could only be carried out through some form of plebiscite. Moreover, during the years of the supreme mentor's rule, the Council would monitor their actions. Deviation from the path would lead to the transfer of power to a more worthy individual. In general, all issues related to this could be carefully thought out, dangers foreseen, decisions weighed carefully, and subsequently improved. But as long as the supreme mentor follows the predetermined path, they are a mystical connection between living humanity and the world above, a manifestation of the Providential will, an improver of billions, and a defender of souls. In the hands of such a person, it is not scary to combine the fullness of spiritual and civic power.

Some may say that such people appear once every five hundred years. But I will say more: personalities of this caliber, possessing a sum of these particular qualities, could not have existed in the past. Einstein could not have appeared among the Maori people of the 19th century; Dostoevsky, as we know him, would have been futile to hope to find among the subjects of Tutankhamun or Theodoric. Then he would have had a different set of qualities, and many of them would not have had the opportunity to manifest in life. Such a person, of whom I speak, even in the most prosperous era, could not have realized the gifts bestowed upon him, and contemporaries would have remained completely ignorant of his true scale and potential. The necessary conditions, apparently, are already emerging in the current era; Rose of the World will create them so that the social and cultural atmosphere ensures the chain of successors worthy of this crown to the supreme mentor.

It may also be said that even all these gifts are not enough for such extraordinary activity; one must possess a broad, sober, and practical state mind. Yes, of course. Such a performer will have to deal with thousands of diverse problems; knowledge, experience, and erudition - economic, financial, legal, and even technical - will be required. But the age of Aristotle has long passed; minds of encyclopedic coverage are unimaginable in our time. And the activity of the person I am talking about is as unthinkable in isolation from the collective mind, from the Supreme Council. The deepest minds, people seasoned in the vicissitudes of state life, specialists in all branches of knowledge will participate in it. Not encyclopedic erudition or practical economic sense will be required of the supreme mentor, but wisdom. Wisdom that understands people at first sight, that immediately finds their essence in the most complex questions, and that never turns a deaf ear to the voice of conscience. The supreme mentor must stand at such a moral height that love and trust in him would replace other methods of governance. Coercion, violence against another's will, are painful for him; he uses them only in the rarest cases.

And yet this is only one of the possible options, although, in my personal opinion, the most desirable one. It is quite possible to have a leadership of the Rose of the World, such a relationship with legislative institutions and with the government of the Federation, in which the principle of collectivity will not be limited by anything or anyone. The time to develop the constitution of the future is in the distant future, and it will be up to our happy descendants, not us, to choose one of many options. But is it not a theocracy? - I do not like the word "theocracy". Theocracy means the rule of God; to apply it to any social and state structure is absurd from the point of view of an atheist, sacrilegious from the point of view of a believer. History knows no theocracy and cannot know it. It is theocracy by the priesthood, the power of the clergy, that should be called a papal or dalai-lama church-state. And the structure I am talking about is directly opposite to any theocracy: not only does the church dissolve in the state, which has absorbed it and is dominant in its name, but also the whole conglomerate of states, and the assembly of churches gradually dissolve into the all-human brotherhood, into the inter-religious church. And it is not the highest hierarchs of the church who occupy seats in the highest bodies, legislative, executive, and controlling, but the best representatives of all peoples, all faiths, all social strata, all professions. It is not theocracy, not monarchy, not oligarchy, not republic: something new, qualitatively different from everything that has existed before. This is a world order, striving for the sanctification and enlightenment of the entire life of the world. I do not know what it will be called then, but the name is not important, the essence is. And the essence of it is the work for the sake of spiritualization of man, spiritualization of humanity, spiritualization of nature.

### Chapter 2. Attitude towards culture

Gradually, a new attitude is emerging towards everything: the existence of the Rose of the World would have no meaning if it only repeated what was said before. A new attitude towards oneself, a new understanding is literally evoked by all phenomena, from the great to the small: the cosmic process and the historical process, the world laws and the connection between different material worlds, human relationships and the paths of personality development, states and religions, the animal kingdom and the elements - in short, everything that we unite under the concept of "culture" and everything that we unite under the concept of "nature". A new attitude is emerging towards everything, but this does not mean that every old attitude is devalued or disgraced: in many cases, only such a point of view is indicated, under which different past attitudes can cease to contrast with each other, begin to complement each other and must be read as different series of aspects of one and the same or many realities. This is often applied, for example, when considering old religions and the realities behind them.

In essence, the entire book is devoted to this new attitude towards things: such a problematic is too extensive and complex to be even briefly outlined in one chapter. This chapter, "Attitude towards culture", and the next, "Attitude towards religions", are not expected to provide a detailed presentation of these topics. The new understanding of different cultural areas, different historical phenomena, different religious systems, as well as different realms of nature, saturates all twelve books of this work. The first chapters are equivalent only to an introduction. They contain a summary presentation of some basic principles, and nothing more.

The leading area of culture in our era is science. The scientific method of knowledge claims hegemony; therefore, this chapter begins with a characterization of the Rose of the World's attitude specifically towards the scientific method. It must be said bluntly and without reservation that no matter how many illusions enthusiasts of the scientific method may create on this score, it has never been, will never be, and cannot be the only method of knowledge or the only method of mastering matter. Not to mention the artistic method, with which the scientific method arrogantly and reluctantly shares its dominant position now, it should be reminded that the foundations of a methodology for knowledge and mastery of materiality have long been laid, the assimilation of which is inseparably linked to spiritual self-improvement of a person, to the enlightenment of his ethical image. Even the possibility of such historical stages when this methodology will come to some primacy looms ahead. I mean not so much discredited concepts like magic or occultism due to a number of misunderstandings, as the concept of spiritual doing. Various systems and schools of this kind exist in all highly developed religions. Developing practical techniques of willpower on the human body and external matter over the centuries and leading a person to this only after lengthy moral preparation and multifaceted skill, they have raised and continue to raise hundreds, perhaps even thousands, of people to what is called miracle-working in common parlance. This methodology, extremely laborious and provoking burning hatred from modern philistines, is distinguished by one principle that is alien to science: the principle of improving and transforming one's own being, as a result of which the physical and etheric coverings of the personality become more flexible, elastic, and more obedient instruments of will than ours. This path leads to such legendary phenomena as physical passage through objects in the three-dimensional world, movement through the air, walking on water, instantaneous overcoming of enormous distances, healing of the incurable and the blind, and finally, as the highest and extremely rare achievement, the resurrection of the dead. Here we see mastery of the laws of our materiality and subordination of the lower to the higher, which are still unknown to us. And if in the 20th century most of us manage to live our whole lives without encountering undeniable cases of such phenomena, then this does not mean that such phenomena do not exist or are fundamentally impossible, but only that the conditions of the irreligious era - cultural, social, and psychological - make it so difficult to study and absorb this methodology (especially in the West and even more so in socialist countries) that the number of such cases is reduced to a few. Some truly fateful events for humanity that took place about two thousand years ago - they will be discussed later - are to blame for the fact that involving not individuals, but multiple human beings in this path of knowledge and mastery of matter proved impossible. In the future, the psychological climate of the irreligious era increasingly hindered progress along this path. Today, mastery of this methodology is extremely difficult, and in some countries it is practically impossible. But there is no reason to believe that this path will remain slow and laborious forever: the irreligious era is not infinite, we live at its end. It is difficult to imagine anything as cumbersome, imperfect, crude, and pitiful as the achievements of modern technology compared to the achievements of the methodology I am talking about. If the same resources and incalculable human reserves that are now absorbed by the development of scientific methodology were devoted to its development and assimilation, the panorama of human life, our creativity, knowledge, social structure, and moral character would change fundamentally. The psychological climate of the era of the Rose of the World will create such favorable conditions for the development of this methodology as never before. But this is a matter of the future, and not a very close one. For now, we have to mainly use another methodology, much less perfect, not leading far, but universally dominant now.

Hence the overall attitude of the Rose of the World towards science and technology at the current historical stage. Laboriously accumulating facts, deriving from them certain regularities, without understanding their nature or direction, but mechanically mastering them and being unable to predict what inventions and social upheavals will result from their discoveries - science has long been accessible to everyone, regardless of the moral character of each individual. The results are before our eyes and over our heads. The main result is that no person on earth is guaranteed that a hydrogen bomb or some other even more stunning achievement of science will not be dropped on him and his fellow citizens at any moment by highly intelligent minds. It is therefore natural that one of the first measures of the Rose of the World after taking control of the activities of the state will be the creation of a Supreme Scientific Council - that is, such a college that will be distinguished by the inner circles of the Rose of the World. Composed of individuals combining high scientific authority with high moral character, the Council will take control of all scientific and technical activities, directing its work along two paths: planning and safeguarding.

Everything related to safeguarding the interests of humanity is generally clear enough, at least in its principles, and there is hardly any need to dwell on this here. As for the problems associated with safeguarding the interests of the animal and plant kingdoms, they will be illuminated in the corresponding sections of the book devoted to the animal world and the worlds of the elementals. Because this is perhaps the only area where the views of the Rose of the World and the views of most contemporary scientists cannot be reconciled. However, this contradiction does not affect any conclusions of science, but only some of its specific practical methods, which are not only incompatible with the eyes of the Rose of the World, but also in the eyes of almost any religious-moral teaching and even almost any humane person's elementary requirements for good.

Apart from these purely methodological contradictions, there are no points of collision between the Rose of the World and science, and there cannot be. They have nowhere to collide. They are about different things. Perhaps it is not accidental that the majority of the great scientists of the 20th century were able to possess personal religiosity without hindering their scientific erudition, without preventing them from sharing and even creating bright spiritualistic systems of philosophy. Einstein and Planck, Pavlov and Lemaitre, Eddington and Milne, whatever the areas of their scientific research, remained deeply believing individuals in their own way. Of course, I am not taking into account the Soviet period Russian scientists, some of whom were forced to declare their materialism not for philosophical reasons, but for reasons understandable to everyone else. Let us leave philosophy and politics alone: in purely scientific areas, the Rose of the World does not assert anything that science has the right to deny. What is apparent is that science is silent on the realities that the Rose of the World asserts. But this is a temporary phenomenon. As for the social, cultural, and ethical problems that the Rose of the World will strive to solve, it is impossible to imagine that they will be met with any substantive objections from scientific authorities.

It is thought that the idea of planning science will no longer be the subject of discussion, but rather the boundaries of what is covered by planning and its practice. Special study of the practice of planning and coordinating scientific work in some states in the mid-20th century will probably not be without interest. However, only individual details can be used, if only because the Federation will consist of many states, large and small, just united, standing at different stages of economic development, formed in the midst of different cultures and possessing different socio-political systems. Some of these systems, which differ in greater socialization of economic relations, will be more easily involved in the general inevitable process of world socialization; others, accustomed to the anarchy of production, will be gradually drawn into it. All this, as well as the diversity of cultural types, will create an extraordinary diversity in the world economy in the first period and different cultural systems that are inactive towards each other. National antagonisms will still be felt for a long time. It will not be possible to balance and coordinate the needs of individual countries and individual segments of the population interested, for example, in the priority development of certain industries here and there or in the sale of their products somewhere else, immediately. Those who will lead the Scientific Council and the Rose of Peace will require a new psychological quality for a fair solution to these problems: overcoming in themselves the dominance of local, still natural, cultural and racial ties, complete national impartiality. How much effort, what authority and even self-sacrifice will be required, at least to weaken outdated antagonisms - Anglo-Arab, for example, Russo-Polish or Armenian-Turkish! What behavior will Germans, Englishmen, Russians, or Americans deserve to forget the enmity they have aroused in so many nations? What educational means will be required to destroy the complex of suppressed self-esteem that prevents many small and medium-sized nations from being friendly to their neighbors and turns into aggressive dreams of achieving their own greatness at the expense of the greatness of others? But this is only one side of the task. Many Western nations will have to eradicate the slightest traces of the ancient sense of superiority over others in themselves. The Russian will have to understand that his country is not the crown of creation and certainly not better than many others. The Englishman will be forced to do titanic internal work to detach himself from the involuntary preference of the interests of the inhabitants of the British Isles over the interests of the inhabitants of Indonesia or Tanganyika. The French will need to learn to embrace the interests of Paraguay or Thailand as passionately as their own. The Chinese or Arab will free their hearts and minds from centuries-old, once-justified but now outdated mistrust of Europeans and learn to pay attention to the needs of Belgium or Greece no less than the needs of Zhejiang or Sudan. Latin American residents will have to unlearn the habit of caring and complaining only about themselves and participate in the distribution of global goods, taking into account the needs of Afghanistan, Cambodia, and even Yakutia. And citizens of the United States must remember that they are Christians and that Christianity is incompatible with bestial hatred of any race, even if it is black. It is difficult, very difficult - it is clear that it is terribly difficult, but getting rid of wars and tyrannies can only be achieved through this psychological self-transformation. And, of course, no one who has not completed such an operation can hope to participate in the work of global planning organizations. It will even be necessary to learn national self-sacrifice - not with one's own blood, of course, not with the lives of one's sons, but only with dollars. For the most affluent countries, it will be necessary to share their resources with the peoples of the East and South to some extent and share it selflessly, without any hope of making this assistance a successful business. In short, everyone involved in the leadership of the Rose of the World must first feel like a member of the cosmic whole, then a member of humanity, and only after all of this - a member of their nation. And not the other way around, as we have been taught so far. 

Because the ultimate goal of the Rose of the World, or rather, of the gigantic spiritual process that began millennia ago and of which the Rose of the World is only a stage, is enlightenment of Shambhala. The immediate task of this epoch is to establish material prosperity, simple well-being, and elementary moral relations between people everywhere, leaving no one beyond its reach. The thesis that all people without exception should be provided with work, rest, leisure, a peaceful old age, cultural housing, the enjoyment of all democratic freedoms, and the satisfaction of basic material and spiritual needs, will begin to be rapidly realized. Only in the last chapters will I be able to shed light on the concrete measures, the system of sequential reforms, thanks to which, as I see it, these principles can be embodied in flesh and blood. For now, it's only about the principles. Those who do not sympathize with these principles should not waste their time and energy reading further, while those who sympathize should understand the inner spirit of the Rose of the World before turning to reflection on the ways of realizing these ideals in life.

This is the principle of the Rose of the World's attitude towards science and technology, as far as it can be conveyed without delving into meta-historical and trans-physical depths. And this should be the role of the scientific method in the series of immediate epochs.

Several decades will pass. The progressive growth of productive forces will reach a level that we will be able to call universal prosperity. The living conditions that citizens of advanced countries enjoy now will be established in the most remote corners of the globe. The allocation of the immense sums of money that are now spent on armaments for peaceful purposes will give economic progress almost unimaginable momentum. The period of universal primary education will probably be overcome in all countries even earlier, and in the future, even universal secondary education will begin to appear insufficient. The outlines of the intelligentsia will coincide with the outlines of humanity. The development of new means of communication, their accessibility, and their comfort will practically eliminate the problem of international and intercultural space. The working day, decreasing more and more, will release new reserves of time. Physiology will develop equipment to help the human brain quickly and firmly memorize the information it receives. Leisure time will increase. And the questions that most people are concerned about now - the interests of the economy, the organization of production, the improvement of products, industrial technology, and the further improvement of living facilities - will lose their urgency. It is even quite likely that those generations will not understand and will find it strange how their predecessors could be so engrossed and agitated about such boring and flat problems. The reserves of energy will be turned towards creating higher-order values because the material basis of life will be immune to any fluctuations, comprehensive, and completely stable.

Technical and economic problems will no longer attract primary attention. They will be addressed within the appropriate collectives, and their publicity will be no greater than that given to issues of public kitchens or water supply, and human talent will turn to something else: to what will be dictated by thirst for knowledge, love for all living things, the need for higher forms of creativity, and a passion for beauty.

The thirst for knowledge, once driving explorers to navigate unknown seas, to wander through uncharted continents, will first propel them, possibly even before the advent of the Rose of the World, into space travel. But foreign planets are inhospitable; after a few reconnaissance expeditions, these flights will stop. And the thirst for knowledge itself will begin to change its direction. Systems will be developed for educating and unleashing in the human being the potentially inherent spiritual organs of sight, spiritual hearing, deep memory, and the ability to voluntarily separate the internal, immaterial structures of the human being from his physical body. Journeys will begin to immaterial worlds, to the opening layers of Shadanakar. It will be the era of Magellans of planetary space, and Columbuses of spirit.

What system of views on personality, its value, its rights and duties, on the path of its improvement will contribute to the establishment of a new psychological climate and hasten the advent of this golden age?

It is precisely in the fact that personality contains innate abilities for creativity and love with the divine that its absolute value is enclosed. Its relative value depends on the stage of its ascending path, on the sum of efforts - its own and Providential - expended on achieving this stage, and on the extent to which it reveals these abilities of god-making and love in life.

The earthly segment of the ascending monad's cosmic path is a stage at which its abilities for creativity and love can and should be extended to its natural and artificial environment, improving it by overcoming the tendency towards isolated self-assertion of its parts and particles at the expense of others. Evil is rooted in this tendency, no matter how it manifests itself. Its forms and scales are diverse almost to infinity, but the basis is always the same: the desire to assert oneself at the expense of others and everything else.

Ancient religions saw the relative value of a person in the degree to which they fulfilled the prescriptions of a given religious and moral code. Ascetic religions regarded sanctity as the highest level, understanding it as the purest example of monastic service or martyrdom for faith. At the same time, love took a back seat. Monastic or martyric feat was performed not out of love for people and all living beings, but out of the thirst for reunification with God and liberation from posthumous torment. Of course, I mean here the dominant direction, prevailing mood, and not the images of such amazing individual actors, apostles of love, like St. Francis, Ramajuana, or Milarepa. However monstrous it may seem to us, even the eternal torment of sinners in hell did not evoke in the majority of adherents of these religions a desire to enlighten the world's laws, including the law of retribution or karma. Eternal retribution for temporary violation of their laws seemed to them a fair act of the Deity or, in any case (as in Brahmanism), an indisputable and absolutely insurmountable law. Buddha burned with the flame of compassion like a candle, but he too taught only how to break out of the circle of the iron laws of the world, not how to enlighten and transform them. As for creativity, its innate nature was not recognized by the monad at all, not even the concept of it existed, and specific types of creativity available to humans were not considered valuable, except for religious creativity in a narrow sense: spiritual work, theology, preaching, temple construction, culture.

Other religions, not inclined towards asceticism, such as Islam and Protestantism, modified this ideal, expanding it and at the same time lowering it, making it more accessible, more popular, even to the point of fulfilling several commandments regarding God, the state, the immediate environment, the family, and finally, oneself. It must be repeated that neither group of religions set the task of transforming society, let alone nature, before anyone. Accordingly, the concept of the obligation of the individual remained stunted and narrow. Naturally, such tasks, but in an extremely simplified form, were finally set by irreligious teachings. A reduced and contradictory ethical ideal was proclaimed, mechanically combining some progressive features with those that went against the ethical minimum, which had long seemed indisputable. The old formula "the end justifies the means" was recalled and, fearing to proclaim it with honest frankness, it was practically used. When characterizing and evaluating historical phenomena, their moral quality was completely ignored; verdicts were rendered only based on the consideration of the overall progressive or reactionary direction of the given phenomenon. No one was disturbed by the fact that this led to the justification of the bloody activities of many despots of the past and even such blatant mass massacres as the Jacobin terror or the activity of the Oprichnina. Many old achievements of social progress, such as freedom of speech, the press, or religious propaganda, were discarded. Generations raised in such an atmosphere gradually lost the very need for these freedoms - a symptom that speaks more eloquently than any tirade about the stunning spiritual regression of society. Thus, as the ideal approached in the form in which it was presented in reality, even the positive that it contained was devalued. For ahead, only the kingdom of material satiety was painted, bought at the price of renouncing spiritual freedom, with multimillion human lives sacrificed and billions of souls relegated to the lower layers of Shadanakar, who gave up their divine primogeniture for a bowl of lentil soup.

One should hope that the terrible lesson will not be in vain.

The teachings of the Rose of the World point to the absolute value of the individual, to their divine primacy: the right to be free from the burden of poverty, from the burden of aggressive societies, to well-being, to all kinds of free creativity and to the publication of this creativity, to religious pursuits, to beauty. The right of human beings to a secure existence and the use of the benefits of civilization is an inherent right that does not require giving up either freedom or spirituality. To assert that there is some fatal dilemma here, that in order to achieve all natural, self-evident goods, one must sacrifice personal spiritual and social freedom, is to deceive people.

The doctrine also points to the obligations of the individual: the consistent expansion of the sphere of what is encompassed by their love, the growth, multiplication, and enlightenment of what is created by their creativity. Creativity thus becomes both a right and a duty. To this day, I cannot understand how this truly divine human ability did not receive proper recognition in any of the ancient religions, except for some forms of polytheism, especially Hellenic. It seems that only in Greece were people able to deify not only works of art, but the very creative ability itself, specifically creative, and not productive, as in other forms of polytheism, and even to crown great artists with apotheoses. It is sad and strange that after the decline of Greece, the gift of creativity ceased to attract the attention of religions and was no longer understood ontologically, metaphysically, or mystically. Under the influence of a one-sided understanding of the Semitic idea that after six days of creation, the Divine creative spirit rested, even the question of further divine creativity was preferred to be avoided by theological thought, and the speech of God, recorded in the Revelation of John - "Behold, I make all things new" - remained a singular ascent, a singular insight. Human creativity, however, was viewed with suspicion, as if the pride that a human creator could fall into was more dangerous and fatal than creative infertility. Unfortunately, no less regrettable is the view of human creativity that has been established in religions of Indian origin.

In the past centuries, Western culture, with its rich manifestations of genius in all areas of art, science, philosophy, has taught us many things. They taught us to have a reverential attitude towards human creativity and to respect human labor. However, the irreligious spirit of these centuries contributed to what the ancient religions feared: pride in one's creative talent became inherent to the human creator, as if he had created this gift within himself. Nevertheless, this self-sufficiency nested itself not so much in the souls of genuine geniuses, let alone spiritual messengers, but among the ranks of secondary figures in science and the arts. A more detailed consideration of these problems from the perspective of the teaching of the Rose of the World will be the subject of a series of special chapters in this book.

In any case, creativity, like love, is not an exclusive gift known only to the chosen ones. The chosen ones know righteousness and holiness, heroism and wisdom, genius and talent. But this is only the disclosure of potentials inherent in every soul. The depths of love and inexhaustible springs of creativity boil beyond the threshold of consciousness of each of us. The religion of the end will strive to destroy this barrier, to let the living waters break through here, into life. In generations raised by it, a creative attitude towards everything will be revealed, and even labor will not be a burden, but a manifestation of an insatiable thirst to create something new, to create the best, to create their own. All followers of the Rose of the World will enjoy creative work, teaching this joy to their children and youth. To create in everything: in word and town planning, in exact sciences and horticulture, in the adornment of life and in its softening, in worship and in the art of mysteries, in the love of men and women, in the nurturing of children, in the development of the human body and in dance, in the enlightenment of nature and in play.

Because all creativity, except for demonic creativity done in one's own name and for oneself, is an act of divinity. Through it, humans elevate themselves above themselves, worshiping not only their own hearts but also the hearts of others.

In terms of personal spiritual development, most people follow a slow and broad path. This path passes through marriage and childbearing, various forms of activity, the fullness and diversity of life experiences, its joys and pleasures. But there is also the Narrow Path, which belongs to those who have a special gift in their soul that requires strict self-restraint: the gift of holiness. Religious teachings that assert the Narrow Path as the only correct or highest path are unjust. Similarly, social or religious systems that deny it altogether and erect obstacles before those who feel called to such a path are also wrong. In the era of the Rose of the World, monasteries are unlikely to be numerous, but they will exist so that anyone whose spiritual thirst drives them to the Narrow Path can work on developing such soul abilities that require years of work in silence and seclusion. If a person embarks on the Narrow Path out of fear of retribution or because of a dream of personal, self-absorbed, closed communication with the Divine, their victories are worthless. There is no deity who rewards their faithful servants with the blissful contemplation of their greatness. The contemplation of the highest spheres is the way for the individual to exit themselves and join the One that encompasses all monads and creates the entire world. Therefore, a follower of the Rose of the World can be compelled to embark on the Narrow Path not by spiritual egoism or a thirst for personal salvation with cold indifference to others, but by an understanding that such gifts are revealed on the Narrow Path, with which the righteous will help the world more effectively from seclusion than hundreds of people living in the world, and which, after death, become such a force that even mighty demonic hierarchies bow before it.

There is no need for scary oaths accompanying the initiation ceremony. There is no basis for condemning or reviling someone who has strayed from the path after a number of years. The initiate will first take only a temporary vow: for three years, five, or seven. Only after successfully completing such stages will they, if they wish, be granted the right to take a vow for a longer period of time; and yet the awareness of irreversibility, the suspicion of an irreparable mistake, will not torment and crush them, giving rise to despair and violent outbursts of unfulfilled desires: they will know that at the end of the term they are free to return to the world, free to choose any way of life, any work, free to have a family and children, without deserving condemnation or contempt from anyone.

I have tried to anticipate the attitude of the Rose of the World towards scientific and non-scientific methods of cognition, towards personality, its rights and obligations, towards human creativity and work, and now towards the two main types of spiritual path: Broad and Narrow. To supplement the representation of her attitude towards culture, it would be necessary to dwell on her views on art - in the broadest sense of the word. But this question is so ambiguous and important, and personally so close to me, that I have decided to dedicate a series of chapters to it in one of the further parts of the book. Therefore, before moving on to the question of the Rose of the World's attitude towards other religions, I will only say a few fleeting words about the arts of the approaching era.

What are the characteristics of the art that people who are associated with the spirit of the Rose of the World will create in the coming epochs, when the sun of the golden age is only beginning to illuminate the clouds on the horizon?

It would be naive to try to predict or outline the diversity of artistic movements, genres, schools, and stylistic techniques that will emerge in this sphere of culture by the end of this century. However, it seems to me that a certain predominant style will be defined, which will not exhaust all the currents of art (in conditions of maximum freedom, this is impossible, and not necessary for the same reason), but is destined to become a kind of "mainstream" in art and literature in the last third of the century. In this style, Rose Mira's inherent perception of things will find its expression: a perception that sees through layers of physical reality to other immaterial or spiritual layers. Such a worldview will be far from intentional optimism, afraid to disturb its own tranquility by paying attention to the dark and tragic sides of existence. The creators of this art will not avoid contemplating the mournful and terrible underside of the world. They would consider it cowardly to want to forget about the bloody path of history, about the reality of the ominous, infra-physical layers of Shadanakar, about their merciless laws, which hold in bondage the inhuman torments of countless unhappy beings, and about the most frightening outbursts of the human spirit, which are prepared by the forces of the Antigod and will almost inevitably come to pass in history when the golden age has exhausted its forward movement. However, a high degree of awareness will not hinder their love for the world, for the earth, and will not diminish their joys, born of nature, culture, creativity, social service, love, friendship - on the contrary! Does awareness of hidden dangers that threaten those you love weaken the passion of love? There will be wonderful creations of unprecedented completeness of life affirmation, purity, and joy. In the streams of all the arts - those that already exist and those that will arise - there will appear sparkling works of the creators of the future about love, more multifaceted than ours, about youth, about the joys of home and social activity, about the expansion of human consciousness, about the widening of the boundaries of perception, about the elements that have become friendly with humans, about the daily proximity of as-yet-invisible friends of our hearts, and about many other things that will excite the people of those epochs, and that we cannot even imagine.

It seems to me that such an art, brave in its fearlessness and feminine in its love, is a wise combination of joy and tenderness towards people and the world, with a keen understanding of its dark depths. It could be called permeating realism or meta-realism. And should we even say that a work of art necessarily needs to be an example of permeating realism for people who are connected to the spirit of the Rose of the World to be able to enjoy and admire it? They will enjoy everything that is marked by talent and at least one of these characteristics: a sense of beauty, a wide range of coverage, depth of thought, sharpness of eye, purity of heart, and joy of soul.

There will come a time when the ethical and aesthetic level of society and of the artists themselves will be such that there will be no need for any restrictions, and the freedom of art, literature, philosophy, and science will be complete. But between the moment when the Rose of the World takes control of the states and the era of this ideal level, several decades will pass. The idea might arise not from wisdom but from youthful immaturity that society has already reached the heights of development where absolute freedom cannot generate fatal, irreversible abuses. Initially, it will be necessary to entrust the local branches of the World Art Council, among other more encouraging functions, with this one control, through which the artistic work will pass before it is made public. This will be - if the reader will excuse the pun - the swan song of censorship. At first, when national antagonisms and racial prejudices have not yet been eliminated and aggressive organizations still play on these prejudices, a ban will have to be imposed on any propaganda of hatred between certain population groups. Later, control will still be maintained over books and textbooks popularizing scientific and philosophical ideas, but only to prevent them from being incomplete, lightweight, or distorting objective facts, and not to mislead unqualified readers. I think that control over artistic works will still be maintained, requiring them to have a certain minimum amount of artistic merit and protecting the book market from being flooded with tasteless, aesthetically illiterate rubbish. And finally, the unconditional ban on pornography will probably be the most persistent. With the abolition of each of these restrictions, another measure will replace it: after the release of a substandard work, the World Art Council or World Scientific Council will publish their authoritative judgment on it. That will be enough. Of course, it will not be easy to develop a system for filling seats in these councils that would guarantee all areas of culture against the intervention of people with narrow partisan or narrow school views, intolerant supporters of any one artistic trend or philosophical concept, or defenders of the creative interests of a limited group, nation, or generation. However, I do not think that in the psychological atmosphere of the Rose of the World.

If we don't delve into the distinction between the concepts of culture and civilization, we can say that culture is nothing but the collective creativity of humanity. And if creativity is the highest, most precious, and sacred ability of human beings, a manifestation of their divine spirit, then there is nothing more precious and sacred on earth than culture, especially the more spiritual the cultural layer, cultural area, or cultural creation.

Humanity's universal culture is still emerging; so far, we have only seen fully formed cultures of individual super-national groups, i.e., groups of nations united by a jointly created, unique culture. But each of these cultures is by no means exhausted by the sphere that exists, develops, and occupies our three-dimensional space. Those who created this culture here continue their creativity even after death - creativity that has changed, of course, to suit the conditions of the world or worlds through which the soul of the creator now passes. The idea arises of millions of such souls in community, of heavenly countries and cities over each of the super-national groups of the world, and of Arimoye, the emerging heavenly country of universal culture.

This principle of relating to culture is new and unusual. We could even note that, with further deepening and detailing, it will grow into an extensive myth if we do not understand the word "myth" as something without any reality. Here, on the contrary, we are talking about the reality of colossal proportions, which is reflected obscurely, but still reflected, in such a myth.

The atmosphere of the Rose of the World and its teachings will create conditions for the myth of culture to become accessible to every mind. And even though only a limited number of consciousnesses can grasp its esoteric complexity, the spirit of this concept, rather than its letter, will gradually become available to almost everyone. And if one delves into the psychological perspectives that the acquisition of such a concept promises from the masses' side, the hope for creating a system of measures that guarantees all areas of culture from the intervention of people who have no internal rights to lead these areas will no longer seem unattainable.

### Chapter 3. Attitude towards religions

How often do we use the word "truth" and how rarely do we try to define this concept? Let us not be confused, however, by repeating Pilate's question, and let us try to understand this concept to the best of our ability.

We call theories or doctrines true if, in our view, they express an undistorted representation of some object of knowledge. In the precise sense of the word, truth is an undistorted reflection of some object of knowledge in our mind, and as many objects of knowledge exist in the world, so too can there be many truths.

But objects of knowledge are known to us, not in and of themselves. Therefore, the truth about any object of knowledge known to us must be recognized as relative truth. Absolute truth, on the other hand, is a reflection of an object of knowledge that has been perceived "in itself" by some subject of knowledge. This kind of knowledge is fundamentally possible only when the opposition between the object and the subject is eliminated; when the subject of knowledge identifies with the object.

Absolute truth, as a universal truth, is an undistorted reflection of the great universe perceived "in itself" by someone's consciousness. Private absolute truths are undistorted reflections of some part of the universe, a part that has been perceived "in itself".

Naturally, the absolute truth of the great universe can arise only in the consciousness of a subject of knowledge comparable to it, a subject of omniscience capable of identifying with the object, capable of knowing things not only "from itself," but also "in itself." Such a subject of knowledge is called the Absolute, God, the Sun of the world.

God "in himself," as an object of knowledge, is known only by himself. His absolute truth, like the absolute truth of the universe, is accessible only to him.

It is clear that any particular truth, no matter how small the object of knowledge may be, is only accessible to us in its relative form. However, this agnosticism should not be understood as absolute: when any private subject of knowledge coincides, any monad with a subject, absolute knowledge of not only "from oneself" but also "in itself" becomes possible. Thus, a conditional agnosticism is legitimate, not an absolute one.

Private truths may have several or many variants - personal, individual varieties of one particular relative truth. In this case, objects of knowledge of small (compared to the subject) scales will be reflected in the consciousness of a series of related subjects almost or completely identically: it is precisely the relatedness of many subjects among themselves that conditions the fact that their personal variants of a certain truth are also related. If this were not the case, people would be unable to understand each other in anything. However, the larger the object of knowledge compared to the subject, the more variants it evokes. The relative truth of the Universe and the relative truth of the Deity produce as many personal variants as there are perceiving subjects.

It is clear, therefore, that all our "truths" are, strictly speaking, only approximations to the truth. And the smaller the object of knowledge, the better it can be grasped by our knowledge, the smaller the gap between its absolute truth and our relative truth about it. However, there is a limit to the relationship between the scale of the subject and the object below which the gap between absolute and relative truth begins to increase again. For example, the gap between the absolute truth of some elementary particle and our relative truth about it is extremely large. However, between the Absolute truth of the Universe, the Absolute truth of the Deity, and our relative truths about them, the gap is incomparably great.

I express thoughts that, after Kant, should, it would seem, be well-known and generally accepted. However, if they were assimilated by every religiously sensitive and religiously thinking person, no one's claims to personal or collective knowledge of the Absolute truth, no one's claims to the absolute truthfulness of any theory or doctrine, could have a place.

As shown above, Absolute Truth is only the possession of the Omniscient Subject. If any human subject were to possess such truth, for example, the collective consciousness of a specific-historical church, this would be objectively evident in the unconditional omniscience of that collective consciousness. The fact that no human collective or individual possesses such omniscience once again demonstrates the baselessness of any claim of any doctrine to absolute truth. If representatives of the Rose of the World were ever to claim absolute truth for their teaching, it would be just as baseless and foolish.

But equally baseless and foolish is the assertion that all teachings, or any one teaching, is false. There are no completely false teachings and cannot be. If an opinion were to appear devoid of even a shred of truth, it could not become a teaching, that is, a sum of ideas transmitted to someone. It would remain the property of the person who produced it, as is the case, for example, with philosophical or pseudoscientific constructions of some mentally ill individuals. Only individual particular statements can be false in the strictest sense of the word, which can create the illusion of truth borrowed from partly true theses adjacent to it in the overall system. However, there is a certain relationship between the quantity and weight of partly true and false theses, at which the sum of false ones begins to devalue the crumbs of truth contained in the teaching. Then there are teachings in which false statements not only devalue the element of truth but also turn the entire system into a category of negative spiritual values. Such teachings are commonly called "left-hand" teachings. The future teaching of the Antigod, which apparently marks the penultimate stage of world history, will be constructed in such a way that even a minimal weight of partly true elements will make the false statements appear as truthful as possible. This will result in the circumstance that this teaching will entangle human consciousness in the nets of falsehood more firmly and hopelessly than any other.

Religions that do not belong to the category of "left-hand" teachings differ from each other not in terms of the truth of one and the falsehood of the others, but along two completely different coordinates. Namely:

Firstly, due to the different levels of their ascent to absolute truth, that is, according to the decrease of subjective and epochal elements within them. This staged difference can be conditionally called a difference along the vertical.

Secondly, they differ from each other because they talk about different things and reflect different series of objects of knowledge. This type of difference - segmental differences - can be conditionally called differences along the horizontal.

Both types of differences should not be overlooked when considering the issue of the Rose of the World's attitude towards other religions.

In the development of science, we observe a continuous process of accumulating relative, partial truths and their improvement, clarification. At each stage, usually not the series of previously accumulated facts are rejected, but only their outdated interpretation. Cases where an old series of facts is questioned and rejected, as happened with alchemy, for example, are relatively rare. But in the history of religions, unfortunately, other customs prevail. Instead of successively replacing one another's spiritual insights that are not subject to doubt, we more often see how significant series of previously achieved relative and partial truths are rejected at the next stage of religious development, and our new series of them, including some old ones, is presented as absolute.

This observation is especially true with regard to the transition from so-called pagan religions to monotheistic systems.

It is clear that if we were to maintain such customs in the expanding horizons of the 20th century, we would at most create another sect. Introducing scientific methodology into religion would, of course, be a gross mistake, as illegal as transferring methods of art to the field of science. But it is high time to adopt the good practice of scientists - not to reject but to rethink the series of previously accumulated relative truths.

From what has been said, it follows that no doctrines other than those of the "left hand," recognized primarily by their spiritually disintegrating effect, can be completely rejected. They must be recognized as insufficient, burdened with subjective-human contributions: epochal, class-based, racial, individual. However, a kernel of relative truth, a kernel of knowledge "from us" of one or another area of the transphysical world, exists in each of the religions, and each such truth is precious for all of humanity. Naturally, the volume of truth in systems that have developed as a result of the experience of many individuals is usually greater than the volume of truth in systems that are only spread among small groups. Exceptions can be young systems that may rise to wide dissemination, but, as a matter of course, first pass through the stage of cellular or limited-group existence.

Such widely disseminated systems are called myths in this concept—as will be explained in more detail below. Behind myths, there is always some transphysical reality, but it cannot be free from distortion and confusion caused by the multitude of "human, all-too-human" contributions to the myth. The methodology for releasing the transphysical kernel of myths from their human shell is unlikely to be strictly and precisely formulated, at least not yet. It has not been possible to develop the necessary mechanism of criteria for this, which would be sufficient in any case. And it is doubtful whether such a complex mystical task can be solved with just one rational approach. However, one can construct a classification of religions based on the teleology of history, which would allow one to identify highly developed religions as a special group and to verify that there are theses affirmed by this group of religions, although with varying degrees of purity and strength. These include: the thesis of the unity of God, the plurality of various spiritual hierarchies, the plurality of different meanings of the worlds, the infinite plurality of becoming monads, as well as the existence of a certain common moral law, which is characterized by this or that posthumous retribution for human deeds in life. In all other respects, and even in the interpretation of the common theses just listed, myths either contradict each other or speak of different things.

However, while in many cases the individuality of the subject introduces something foreign and purely human into the representations of the knowable, on the other hand, there are just as many cases where some spiritual truth can only be perceived by a specific configuration of the knowing consciousness. Individuality turns out to be a factor that does not cloud cognition, but, on the contrary, makes it truly possible. The teleological process in the religious history of humanity partly consisted in the fact that the consciousness of a particular personality, people, race, or era was polished by the influence of historical and biographical factors in such a way as to make it capable of perceiving the truths of this transcendent reality. To other individuals, peoples, races, and eras, such polished consciousness and its religious experience may have seemed strange, distorted, or immature, fraught with all kinds of aberrations.

Of the hundreds of possible examples, I will take one very bright one for now: the idea of reincarnation. Deeply inherent in Hinduism and Buddhism, and present in esoteric Judaism (Kabbalah), this idea is rejected by Orthodox Christianity and Islam. But should we think, based on this "non-universality" of the idea, that it represents a racial or stage-cultural aberration of Indian consciousness? The point is that in coordinating the theses of different religions, one must first learn to sift the main from the secondary, the common from the particular. The "common," the main thing in any thesis, lies in the seed of the idea, which shows extraordinary stability over the centuries: thrown into the soil of different cultural environments, it gives rise to different shoots - different variations of the given thesis. If there is any teleological directionality in history at all, then, of course, this directionality must first of all be reflected in the being of such stable spiritual seeds - in the widely spread, professed by millions of consciousnesses, foundations of ideas.

The seed of the idea of reincarnation consists of the teaching about a certain Self that undergoes its cosmic development, or a known segment of it through successive existences in our physical world. Everything else, such as the spiritual-material nature and structure of the reincarnating Self, a certain dependence of reincarnations on the law of karma, the extension of the principle of reincarnation also to the animal world, or the denial of such extension - all these are just variations and modifications of the basic idea. It is clear that in these variations and details one can encounter more and more genuine aberrations than in the seed of the idea, for the perception of which the Indian people's teleological forces worked for many centuries, expending incredible effort to weaken in many of its representatives the midriff between daytime consciousness and deep memory - the repository of memories of the soul's paths up to the moment of its last incarnation. The fallacy of religious dogmas lies mostly not in their content but in the claims that the law asserted by the dogma has universal, cosmic significance, and that the fact asserted by the dogma must be professed by all humanity, for without this there is supposedly no salvation. All that has been stated leads us to the recognition of the genuineness of that spiritual experience which crystallized into the idea of reincarnation: yes, such a path of development exists; there is nothing essentially unacceptable here either in Christianity or Islam in the essence of this idea, except, perhaps, that no statements by the founders of Christianity or Islam have reached us regarding the idea of reincarnation (which, however, does not prove anything in itself, since it is well known that not everything they said has made its way into the Gospels and the Qur'an). But it does not follow at all that the path of reincarnation is supposedly the only possible, the only real path of the individual spirit's development. The consciousness of the Indian people, polished in this direction to comprehend this type of path, as often happens in such cases, absolutized its discovery, becoming deaf to the perception of other types of paths of development. The same thing happened with the Jewish and Arab peoples, but under the opposite sign: having perceived the truth about another type of development path, in which incarnation in the physical layer takes place only once, the consciousness of these peoples just as unjustifiably absolutized this second type of path. This is also facilitated by the fact that in different metacultures of humanity, one or another type may generally prevail. As a result, there arose between the two groups of world religions a divergence. In reality, both of these antagonistic ideas are true in their essence, fixing two possible types of paths, and to resolve this "contradiction" nothing is required except for each side to abandon claims of universal exclusivity for their idea.

So, one of the historical reasons for the alleged irreconcilable contradictions between religions lies in the illegitimate absolutization of any thesis.

Here is another reason. One of the main dogmas of Christianity, as is known, is the teaching of the Trinity of the Godhead. The founder of Islam rejected this dogma, suspecting in it a reminiscence of polytheism, and more importantly, because his own spiritual experience did not contain a positive indication of such a truth. But in the 20th century, it is hardly worth repeating the arguments of Christian theologians who once proved and explained the fundamental difference between the dogma of the Trinity and polytheism: it is so elementary that, one would assume, even among Muslim thinkers, there will be no one who, understanding the questions of Christian doctrine, would insist on this erroneous statement. As for the second argument - that Muhammad's spiritual experience did not contain confirmation of the Trinity - it is logically flawed. No one's experience can contain confirmation of all true ideas that arose earlier in the course of collective human understanding of God and the world. Every personal experience is limited, and only the wisdom of the Omniscient (which encompasses the sum of truths "in itself" over the ages) can comprehend them all. Therefore, the fact that Muhammad did not experience anything that confirms the thesis of the Trinity itself should not serve as an argument for refuting this idea, even in the eyes of orthodox Muslims. Instead of the formula "The Prophet, having known the perfect unity of God, became convinced of the falsehood of the teaching of the Trinity," it should be formulated, fairly, as follows: "The Prophet, having known the perfect unity of God, did not, however, receive indications of the Trinity of the One." It is entirely natural that Christian doctrine not only has no objections to the Muslim teaching of Unity but fully coincides with it. It only supplements this thesis with an idea that, with its stability for two thousand years and its prevalence in billions of minds, points to the truth of its foundation. What does the contradiction between these two main dogmas of two religions boil down to? Isn't it just arbitrary and illegitimate denial of one of them of what it has no data on in its own positive experience?

Now we see the second historical and psychological reason for the entrenched disagreements between religious doctrines: the unjustified denial of someone else's statement only on the basis that we do not have positive data on this issue.

Unfortunately, there are countless disagreements based solely on this logical and epistemological inconsistency. Let's consider another case known to everyone: Islam (Sunni) and Protestantism deny the legitimacy of the cult of saints, while almost all other religions accept and implement it in one form or another. The objections to this cult boil down to the idea that man does not need any intermediaries between himself and the deity, and that spiritual honors and prayers, when offered not to God, but to those who were mere humans, are sinful because they lead to the deification of man. But what does this famous formula actually mean: "Man does not need intermediaries"? If the person proclaiming this idea does not need them, then where does he get the right to speak for others, even for all of humanity? Who authorized him? Was it not the billions of people who, in almost all countries and religions, felt a living daily need for such intermediaries, which made the existence of the cult of saints psychologically possible? If we, without experiencing a need for something (there are people, for example, who do not feel the need for music), start to condemn those who do, as foolish fabricators, selfish liars, or dark ignoramuses, what will we prove by this, other than our own ignorance? The second argument is the illegitimacy of giving divine honors and prayers to those who were mere humans. But divine honors (in the monotheistic sense) are not given to them, and no one equates them with God; this idea is completely absurd, and for people who grew up in Christian countries, it is unforgivably ignorant. True, in Hinduism there is the idea of avatars - incarnations of Vishnu in human form; but they are avatars, not saints. People bow before the saints just as they would before those who have managed to overcome their human nature or before the executors of God's will, messengers of the higher world. Protestantism denies the concept of holiness altogether. However, this seems to be more of a dispute about particulars rather than the substance of the matter: after all, by rejecting the ascetic monastic ideal, Luther and Calvin did not diminish the value of worldly righteousness, although they understood it more broadly than Catholicism and somewhat prohibited their followers from turning to his spirit in prayer. This demonstrates the purity and sincerity of their thoughts, but contradicts the foundations of religious and moral worldview in general. For if righteousness, as the highest self-sacrifice for humanity in the name of God, is perfect and selfless service to Him (and if righteousness is understood in this way, then it is ridiculous to deny that it exists in the world, although it is rare in life), then it is impossible to imagine a righteous soul that after death settles into inactive bliss. With all the strength of their soul, including those that are revealed only after death, the righteous will provide help to those who are alive and below in their ascending movement. This is as natural as helping an adult child, and just as little, as this help diminishes or belittles those to whom it is directed. It is unlikely that Prophet Muhammad was unaware of this. It is to be assumed that some extremes, excesses in the cult of saints that he observed among Christians, prompted him to forbid his followers from making any such establishments. Perhaps he believed that this prohibition was balanced by the fact that deceased righteous people do not necessarily need to be reminded by the praying to provide them with invisible help. Anyway, any doctrine that affirms the truth of spiritual immortality and high moral law can only illogically assume that the spirit of the righteous in his posthumous life relates to the living inactivity and apathy. The denial of the cult of saints, or rather the righteous, is logical only from one point of view: materialistic. However, on the other hand, absolutizing the cult of saints as universally binding is equally illegitimate. There are long stages in the path of the soul, even in the path of a whole nation, when they really do not need any "mediators"; when the soul, consciously or unconsciously, feels that strengthening its independence, strength, freedom, spiritual will excludes the possibility of turning to anyone for help other than God Himself. What basis and by what right will we impose participation in the cult of saints on such a person?

The main contradiction between Christianity and other religions is the assertion of the divinity of Jesus Christ as a dogma and the worship of Him as the incarnation of one of the hypostases of the Trinity. It is well known that other religions either agree to recognize Jesus as a prophet among other prophets or ignore Him, sometimes even vigorously denying His providential mission. Christianity, on the other hand, relying on the words of its Founder that no one comes to the Father except through the Son, denies the possibility of salvation for all non-Christians.

However, it seems that we will avoid many misunderstandings and crude reductions of ideas if we try to understand all the sayings of Christ that have come down to us by asking ourselves the question: did Jesus speak in this case as a person, as a concrete historical figure who lived in such-and-such a country from such-and-such a date, or is His mind and mouth transformed into human words by the voice of God, which He hears within Himself? Each statement of Christ requires consideration precisely from this angle: is He speaking in this case as a Messenger of the truth of the spiritual world or as a human being?

For it cannot be imagined that Jesus spoke only as a Messenger at all moments of His life and never as a human being. It is unlikely that there is any doubt that in His mournful cry on the cross, "My God, My God, why have You forsaken Me?", the anguish of one of those moments when He, Jesus, as a human being, experienced the tragedy of abandonment, the tragedy of interrupting the connection of His human Self with the Divine Spirit. And in His teaching, expounded at the Last Supper, one can always hear, instead of the first-person pronoun, the God-Son, the World Logos.

All of His words preserved in the Gospel should be subjected to such a division of Christ's speech into two groups. It is absolutely clear in this case that His words about no one coming to the Father except through the Son should be understood not in the reduced, narrowed, confined, and merciless sense that supposedly no human soul will be saved except for Christians, but in the magnificent, truly spiritual, cosmic sense that every monad, having replenished itself to the end, plunges into the depths of God the Son, the Heart and Demiurge of the universe, and only through this all-completing act returns to its source, to God the Father, incomprehensibly identifying itself with Him and with the entire Holy Trinity.

One of the prominent figures of the religious and philosophical Indian community, Brahmo Samaj, Keshub Chander-Sen, expressed a very profound thought: he said that the wisdom of the Hindus, the meekness of the Buddhists, and the courage of the Muslims all come from Christ. Obviously, in this case, he understood by this name, not the historical personality of Jesus, but the Logos, which is predominantly but not exclusively expressed in Jesus Christ. In this idea, I see a way to a viewpoint that could lead to understanding between Christians and many schools of Eastern religiosity.

It also seems that some expressions that have taken root in Christian theology, which we repeat almost mechanically and which are precisely unacceptable to other faiths, need to be reviewed and clarified. For example, how should we understand the term "incarnation" in reference to Jesus Christ? Do we still imagine that the Logos of the universe was clothed with this particular human flesh? Can we assume that through teleological preparation, a bodily instrument, an individual physical organism, a human brain capable of accommodating the Mind of the Universe, was created from generation to generation? If so, then we must assume that Jesus already possessed omniscience during his lifetime, which is not even consistent with the facts of the gospel story and his own words. Is this disproportion of cosmic and local-planetary, narrow-human categories unbearable for us? Is it unbearable not because it exceeds the limits of our understanding but because it is too obvious that it is a product of thought on a particular, long-passed cultural stage, when the universe was considered billions of times smaller than it actually is, when it seemed really possible for a solid celestial vault to fall to the ground, and a terrible hail of stars falling from the hooks on which they were suspended. Would it not be more accurate, therefore, to speak not of the incarnation of the Logos in the person of Jesus Christ, but of His expression in Him through the Great Monadic Birth that became the Planetary Logos of the Earth? We call Christ the Word, but the speaker does not embody, but expresses himself in the word: God does not embody Himself, but expresses Himself in Christ. It is precisely in this sense that Christ is truly the Word of God. And if so, then another obstacle to the agreement of Christianity with some other religious schools disappears.

I briefly touched on only four interreligious disagreements. Excluding one last one, which arises from controversy and perhaps insufficient clarity of formulations, insufficient crystallization of ideas, the rest are based on the mismatch of the spiritual experience of great visionaries, on the fact that when contemplating certain objects from different points of Shadanakar, under different spiritual angles, observers see the given object in different aspects. These disagreements can conditionally be called horizontal contradictions, meaning the legitimacy of both points of view and their apparent, rather than true, inconsistency.

Another example: since Christianity and Islam have existed, they have continued to struggle with what they call paganism. Over the centuries, humanity has been imbued with the idea of the irreconcilability, incompatibility of monotheism with polytheism, as a kind of axiom. Investigating why and how this happened would lead us too far astray. What is essential is on what basis do Semitic religions, asserting the existence of spiritual hierarchies and having developed doctrine on them - angelology and demonology - limit the diversity of these hierarchies to the few that were included in these medieval schemes? Is there even a shadow of consistency in their fundamental rejection of any experience of spiritual hierarchies - in their truthfulness? There are decisively no grounds for this, except, once again, references to the silence on this matter in the Gospels and the Koran. It was precisely because of the lack of grounds for a wholesale denial that in the first centuries of Christianity, the Church did not so much deny the gods of the Olympic pantheon as identify them with the demons and devils of Semitic canonized texts. At the same time, the character of these deities, as perceived by polytheistic cognition, was ignored, and lowering and discrediting features were arbitrarily attributed to them, or an overly anthropomorphic element, introduced into these concepts by the subject of cognition - polytheistic humanity - was deliberately emphasized, only remaining in their lower, folk variants by that time. As if recognition of the truth of the existence of hierarchies of nature, great elementals or spirit-tribe leaders, could shake the unity of God - the Creator and Builder of the universe, the source and mouth of the world's stream of life - more than recognition of His other beautiful children - angels and archangels, as well as those demons about whom the canonical teachings of the Bible were interpreted!

Unfortunately, this ancient misunderstanding has not yet been clarified: there is nothing left of ancient polytheism, but a fierce, narrow-minded, and wisdom-less intolerance is displayed every time Christian churches, or at least those who speak in their name, are called upon to express their opinion on the systems of Hindu, Chinese, Japanese, and Tibetan religions. The two other Semitic religions are equally intolerant. This is a typical case of horizontal differences between religions: not contradicting each other in essence, not colliding with each other in the vast spiritual cosmos, Christianity and Hinduism, Buddhism and Islam, Judaism and Shintoism speak of different spiritual realms, different segments of Shadanakara; but human limitation interprets this as contradictions and declares one doctrine true and the others false. "If God is one, then other gods are, so to speak, impostors: they are either demons or the product of human imagination." What a childish thought! The Lord God is one, but there are many gods; the spelling of this word in the Russian language with either a capital or lowercase letter clearly indicates differences in meaning in both cases. If repetition of this word in different senses scares anyone, let them replace it with some other term of polytheism, such as "great spirits" or "great hierarchies," but nothing will change from that, except that the use of the word "spirit" can lead to misunderstandings in some cases, because many of these gods are not spirits, but powerful beings possessing material embodiment, albeit in other, transphysical layers of existence.

All these misunderstandings-based disagreements between religions bring to mind a certain comparison I once encountered in religious literature, although I don't remember exactly where: as if several travelers climbed from different sides of the same mountain, saw and explored its different slopes, and upon returning, argued about who actually saw the real existing mountain and who saw figments of their own imagination. Moreover, each argued that the mountain was exactly as it appeared from their side, and the testimony of other travelers about other sides of it was false, absurd, and a trap for human souls. Thus, the first conclusion that can be drawn from the comparison of interreligious disagreements includes eliminating those that are based either simply on misunderstanding or on the mismatch of objects of religious knowledge in different realms of experience, that is, contradictions "horizontally."

But not only polytheism, but also animism and proto-animism are not exhausted by murky, accidental, subjective images that arose in the consciousness of primitive humanity: there is a trans-physical reality beyond them. Providence is Providence precisely because it never allowed peoples and races to be a playground of phantasms and illusions, without any possibility of coming into contact with a higher reality. We would have to recognize not God, but a dark, malevolent force as the true guide of humanity if we were to imagine that for tens of thousands of years, primitive humanity was denied any possibility of experiencing anything spiritual or at least immaterial, of coming into contact with anything other than the physical world and their own phantasms. "But what can the spiritual experience of a 'savage' enrich us with, we who stand on such a high stage of spiritual knowledge compared to him?" - "It is precisely what was understood then, in that environment, with that unique psyche, but was not transmitted, was lost, was not successively perceived by subsequent forms of spiritual knowledge in their treasury. A special study of magical beliefs and experience of pre-logical thinking from this point of view would help not only in the 'rehabilitation' of these ancient beliefs in their essential characteristics, but would also find a place for them in the now-forming synthetic religious worldview. It would be found, for example, that the ideas of the Australian Arunta tribe about a single life substance, constantly flowing in matter everywhere, from being to being, from object to object (and all the religion of this tribe consists essentially of such ideas), is the oldest revelation of humanity about the trans-physical cosmos: this is a living, most vivid, absolute experience of the unity of life force; the Australians called it arungviltja, developed Brahmanism calls it prana, and what the world science will call it in twenty or thirty years - we will still hear."

This disagreement - the assertion of the thesis of the Arungvilta-prana(^1) ancient beliefs and its denial by the overwhelming majority of later religious teachings - can be regarded as a stage disagreement, a disagreement "vertically," a disagreement between different levels of religious knowledge. But even here we encounter the same error, the same unjustified approach to another's experience that we encountered when discussing the question of Islam's denial of the cult of saints or the idea of the Trinity. And here, under all the arguments presented against the ancient revelation, the same naive line of thought is concealed: authoritative texts canonized for me say nothing about Arungvilta-prana; therefore, it does not exist. The line of thought is at least dangerous because in that case, one would have to deny the reality not only of Arungvilta-prana but also of radio waves, elementary particles, many chemical elements, galaxies, and even, for example, the planet Uranus, because canonical texts keep absolute silence about all of this.

____________
(^1): By the way, if the Gospel does not speak directly about Arungvilta-prana, it tells in detail about a long series of cases when Christ and later the apostles used this entity. It is entirely unclear how Christian Orthodox could explain the essence of that immaterial mechanism used by the perpetrators of miraculous healings if they deny the existence of life force spread everywhere.

Thus, it is also revealed that there is a decisive need to take into account what was not taken into account during the formation of ancient, so-called classical confessions: the experience of primitive spiritual knowledge, as well as what could not have been taken into account at that time due to the course of events: the experience of the centuries-long evolution of religions on all continents, the experience of world history, and the experience of science. The material from these series of experiences teaches us to approach all dogmas and theses dynamically, to be able to understand every thesis as a link in the chain of religious-historical development and to be able to divide it into two or even three layers. The deepest layer is the foundation of the idea, containing a relative particular truth. Another layer is the specific coloring, development, and detailing of the idea to the extent that an individual, racial, or epochal aspect justifies it, for it is only such a racial or epochal makeup of the soul that made it possible for this people to perceive this idea in the first place. The outermost, third layer is the shell, aberrations, the inevitable haze of human consciousness, through which the light of revelation penetrates. Therefore, the experience of all stages of development, including polytheistic, animistic, etc., must be freed from its outer layer, from the shell, rethought and included in the worldview of the religion as a whole. Of course, the principle of such work is only vaguely outlined here, the systems of criteria require enormous development, and in general, such a revision of the "religious heritage" is a colossal task that requires the joint efforts of many people; at present, there are not even enough personnel for it, let alone the other necessary conditions. But if this task is great, the sooner at least preparatory work is started, the better. The difficulties should not be underestimated, but there is every reason to hope that, given goodwill, energy, and initiative of the leaders, the gaps and rifts that currently divide all religions will gradually be filled, and although each of the religions will preserve its uniqueness and distinctiveness, some kind of spiritual union, some kind of unification will eventually unite all the teachings of the "right hand".

It is known that many Japanese who practice Christianity remain faithful to Shintoism at the same time. This is something that devout Catholics, Protestants, and even Orthodox Christians find bothersome, as they cannot understand how it is psychologically possible, and even feel that there is something sacrilegious about it. However, this is possible without sacrilege, and it is even natural because the experience of Christianity and the experience of Shintoism differ horizontally: they are about different things. Shintoism is a national myth. It is an aspect of the world's religious revelation addressed to the Japanese people and only to them. It is an understanding of the spiritual, or rather, transphysical reality that transcends the Japanese people and only manifests itself in their history and culture. Shintoism does not provide answers to questions of a cosmic, planetary, or universal nature: about the Creator of the world, the origin of evil and suffering, or the ways of cosmic evolution. It only speaks of Japan's meta-history, its meta-culture, of the hierarchies of its people, and of the heavenly assembly of enlightened souls who ascended to the higher worlds of Shadanakar from Japan. The syncretism of the Japanese, that is, their simultaneous confession of Shintoism and Catholicism, Shintoism and Buddhism, is not a psychological paradox, but, on the contrary, the first hint of how the experiences and truths of different religions should harmoniously complement each other.

Of course, before the union between Christianity and other religions and cults of the "right hand" becomes a reality - and this is one of the historical tasks of the Rose of the World - it is necessary to achieve the reunion of the Christian churches: the preparation for such a reunion, theological, philosophical, psychological, cultural, and organizational, will be carried out by the Rose of the World with unflagging enthusiasm. Until the reunification of Christianity takes place, until the Eighth Ecumenical Council (or several consecutive councils) considers the entire volume of the old dogmatics and introduces into it a series of theses based on the spiritual experience of the last thousand years, and until they sanction with the highest authority of reunited Christianity the theses of the teachings of the Rose of the World, until then, these theses may, of course, be confessed, affirmed, and preached, but they should not be cast into closed, completed, unconditional forms recommended for confession by all Christians.

In this reunification of Christian denominations and in the further union of all religions of Light for the common concentration of all forces on the improvement of humanity and the spiritualization of nature, the Rose of the World sees its supra-religious and interreligious nature.

The religious exclusivity of its followers is not only foreign to them, it is impossible. Wisdom teaches them to cooperate with all peoples in their highest ideals.

Therefore, the structure of the Rose of the World implies a series of concentric circles. Followers of any "right-hand" religion should not be honored by those outside the universal church. Those among them who have not yet reached the consciousness of supra-religious unity occupy the outer circles.

The middle circles include less active, less creative followers of the Rose of the World, while the inner circles include those who have placed the meaning of their existence in conscious and free god-making.

Let the Christian enter the Buddhist temple with awe and reverence: for thousands of years, the peoples of the East, separated from the centers of Christianity by deserts and mountain ranges, have learned about the truth of other parts of the upper world through the wisdom of their teachers. Through the smoke of the incense, here flicker the sculptures of high lords of other worlds and great messengers who spoke about these worlds to people. The Western man has not come into contact with these worlds, so let his mind and soul be enriched with the knowledge preserved here.

Let the Muslim enter the Hindu temple with a peaceful, pure, and strict feeling: false gods do not look upon him here, but conditional images of great spirits, whom the peoples of India understood and passionately loved, and whose testimony should be accepted by other peoples with joy and trust.

And let the orthodox Shintoist not pass by the inconspicuous synagogue with contempt and indifference: here another great people, enriching humanity with the deepest values, safeguards its experience of such truths with which the spiritual world was opened to it - and to no one else.

Their truths, by which the spiritual world was revealed to them - and to no one else.

The Rose of the World can be compared to an inverted flower, whose roots are in the sky, and whose petal cup is here, among humanity, on earth. Its stem is a revelation, through which spiritual juices flow, nourishing and strengthening its petals - a fragrant choir of religions. But besides its petals, it has a core: this is its own teaching. This teaching is not a mechanical combination of the highest theses of various theosophemes of the past. In addition to a new attitude toward religious heritage, the Rose of the World implements a new attitude toward nature, history, human cultural destinies, their tasks, creativity, love, paths of cosmic ascent, and the consistent enlightenment of Shadanakar. In some cases, this attitude is new because although individual figures of the past spoke about it, it is only now being accepted and confessed by religion and the church. In other cases, the attitude of the Rose of the World is new in an absolute sense because it has never been expressed by anyone before. This new attitude arises from a new spiritual experience, without which instead of the Rose of the World, only rational and fruitless religious eclecticism would be possible.

But before we delve into the contents of this spiritual experience and the foundations of this teaching, we must first understand the paths by which souls acquire this experience and the methods by which we can facilitate or accelerate its acquisition for ourselves.

## Book II. On metahistorical and transphysical methods of cognition

### Chapter 1. Some features of the metahistorical method

The expression "religious feeling" is well-known. This expression is incorrect: there is no such thing as "religious feeling" in general, but there exists an immense world of religious feelings and experiences, endlessly diverse, often contrasting with one another, different in their emotional content, in the object of their direction, in their strength, tone, and, so to speak, their color. The breadth and variety of this world is not even suspected by those who lack their own religious experience and judge it only by the testimony of others: such testimony, in the absence of personal experience, is almost always received with distrust, prejudice, and a tendency to interpret it in accordance not with the statements of the witnesses themselves, but with the dogmatic positions of non-religious schemes.

The variety of the world of religious feelings corresponds to the variety of methods of religious cognition. To expound these methods means to write a fundamental study on the history and psychology of religions. Such a task has nothing to do with the task of this book. The task of the book includes - as one of its components - the intention to give an idea only of some methods of religious cognition, namely those which, in my opinion, have the greatest creative value at the current historical stage.

The saddest mistake would be if someone suspected the author of this book of claiming a role as one of the founders of the great project - historical, cultural, and social - of creating what is here referred to as the "Rose of the World." Everything is quite different. The Rose of the World can only appear and emerge as a result of the joint efforts of a huge number of people. I am convinced that not only in Russia, but also in many other parts of the world - primarily, it seems, in India and America - the same process is taking place: the same grandiose otherworldly reality is invading human consciousness, first that of individuals, then of hundreds, in order to later become the possession of millions. Yes, now, at this very moment, people who know nothing about each other, sometimes separated by huge distances and state borders, sometimes only by the walls of a few houses, are experiencing tremendous breakthroughs of consciousness, contemplating transphysical heights and depths, and some are striving - each according to their own abilities and character - to express or at least reflect this experience in works of words, brush, and music. I don't know how many, but apparently quite a few people are standing in this stream of revelation. And my task is to express it as I experience it - and only that.

Therefore, the discussion here will not be about scientific thinking and knowledge or even about art, but about something that requires a certain restructuring of the ideas that have dominated Russia for the last forty years.

I believe that a serious investigation by researchers who have a deep understanding of modern physiology and psychology into the vast apocalyptic literature, autobiographical accounts of spiritual authors, and some religious leaders who have had similar experiences, an unbiased study and generalization of material scattered in works of comparative religion, all of this will eventually lead to the development of a scientific methodology based on which a foundation for the epistemology of religious and, in particular, meta-historical knowledge could be laid. One can imagine the emergence of scientific-pedagogical practice aimed at mastering the mechanism of this knowledge, providing individuals who have previously perceived this process passively with ways to activate and control it, at least in part. But all of this is a matter of the future, and not a close one. For now, it is certain only that the diversity of this process depends on both the subject and object of knowledge. It is impossible to embrace the unembraceable; I can only speak here about the variant of the process that I have encountered in my own life. It will be necessary to strengthen the autobiographical element in the book, although personally, under any other circumstances, I would try to avoid this element.

At the center of attention will be three types of religious knowledge: meta-historical, transphysical, and cosmic. However, it is impossible, and not necessary, to draw a completely clear line between them.

First of all, what exactly is meant here by meta-history?

"Meta-history" exists, says Sergei Bulgakov, perhaps the only Russian thinker who has put this problem at the forefront - "meta-history is the noumenal side of the universal process that, on one of its sides, opens up to us as history". However, it seems to me that applying Kantian terminology to problems of this order is unlikely to help clarify the essence of the matter. The concepts of noumenal and phenomenal were developed by a different train of thought, driven by different philosophical needs. Objects of meta-historical experience can only be squeezed into this terminology system by the method of Procrustes. Even more unwarranted is the conflation of meta-history with any kind of philosophy of history. Philosophy of history is precisely philosophy; meta-history, on the other hand, is always mythological.

In any case, the term "meta-history" is used in this book in two meanings. Firstly, as a set of processes occurring in those layers of alterity that, being immersed in other streams of time and other types of space, sometimes shine through the process perceived by us as history. These otherworldly processes are closely linked to the historical process, largely determining it, but by no means coinciding with it and are fully revealed through the paths of the specific method of cognition that should be called meta-historical.

The second meaning of the word "meta-history" is the teaching about these processes of alterity, a teaching that is, of course, not in the scientific, but in the religious sense.

There is nothing surprising about the fact that the ability to understand these processes is conditioned by various psychological, and perhaps physiological, factors in different individuals. Obviously, we are dealing with some innate predisposition; we can no more evoke or destroy it than, for example, the innate property of musicality. However, this very ability can be suppressed or simply remain unused, like a buried talent, or finally undergo development, sometimes even extremely accelerated. A scientifically educational system, which seems possible to us in the future, would promote the development of this ability. For now, the means of positive influence on this ability have to be groped almost blindly, and noticeable development of it over a lifetime would probably not have been achieved at all if certain forces, acting against our efforts, had not taken on the enormous task of developing in us the corresponding organs of perception. However, it seems quite plausible that, in addition to innate properties and active help from Providential forces, something acquired by us ourselves is also necessary for the emergence of the process of metahistorical cognition, for example - the presence of even a modest but unconditional supply of positive historical information. For a completely ignorant person who does not experience any connection with the historical stream of events, whether he lives in the Australian desert or in the thickets of a modern giant city, the metahistorical method of cognition is closed. The role of the scientific factor in the analyzed psychological process is limited to participation in the accumulation of precisely this stock of historical information and is limited to preparation for this process. The process itself, at least the variant of it that is familiar to me, has nothing to do with scientific forms of cognition. I repeat this and emphasize it.

It consists of three successive stages.

The first stage consists of an instantaneous internal act that occurs without the subject's will and, apparently, without any preliminary preparation - although, of course, such preparation, which takes place outside of consciousness, must occur in reality. The content of this act is an instantaneous experience of immense historical time periods, which is indivisible and inexpressible in words, of the essence of great historical phenomena. The form of such an act is an excessively dynamic minute or hour saturated with boiling images when the individual feels like someone who, after a long stay in a quiet and dark room, is suddenly placed under the open sky in the midst of a storm - which is terrifying in its grandeur and power, almost blinding, and at the same time filled with a feeling of overwhelming ecstasy. The individual had no idea about such a richness of life or the possibility of such a richness before. Entire epochs and the meta-historical cosmos of these epochs with great struggling principles are synthetically grasped all at once. It would be erroneous to assume that these images necessarily have a visual form. No, the visual element is included in them, as is the sound, but they relate to these elements as the ocean relates to the hydrogen in its water. It is extremely difficult to give an idea of this experience due to the absence of any reasonably precise analogies with anything else that is better known.

This experience has a stunning effect on the entire emotional makeup. Its content surpasses everything that was previously within the circle of the individual's consciousness, and it will nourish the emotional world of the one who has experienced it for many years to come. It will become his most valuable inner asset.

This is the first stage of meta-historical understanding. It seems permissible to call it a meta-historical enlightenment.(^1)

____________
(^1): However, this description should not be perceived as an attempt to pre-determine the objective significance of the described psychological phenomenon in a positive sense. This will be discussed later.

The result of enlightenment continues to reside in the depths of the soul, not as a memory, but as something alive and living. Over the years, individual images, ideas, and entire concepts gradually rise up from there into the circle of consciousness, but even more remain in the depths, and the one who has experienced it knows that no concept can ever encompass and exhaust this revealed cosmos of meta-history. These images and ideas become the object of the second stage of the process.

The second stage does not have the instantaneous character of the first: it represents a certain chain of states - a chain that permeates weeks and months and manifests almost daily. This is an inner contemplation, intense immersion, focused scrutiny - sometimes joyful, sometimes painful - into historical images, but not closed in on themselves, but perceived in their unity with the second, meta-historical reality behind them. The expression "scrutiny" is used here conditionally, and by the word "images" I mean synthetic representations that include a visual element only insofar as the observed can have a visually imaginable form. At the same time, it is extremely important that the content of such contemplation largely consists of phenomena of non-dimensional layers of materiality; it is clear that they can be perceived not by physical organs of sight and hearing, but by certain other components of our being, which are usually separated from the zone of daily consciousness as if by a deaf wall. And if the first stage of the process was characterized by the passive state of a person who became an involuntary spectator of an overwhelming spectacle, then in the second stage, to some extent, the guiding action of personal will is possible - sometimes, for example, in the choice of a particular object of contemplation. But more often, and precisely in the most productive hours, images surface involuntarily, radiating, I would say, such a mesmerizing power and revealing such a multi-layered meaning that the hours of contemplation turn into the core - labile resemblances of moments of enlightenment. With a certain creative predisposition of the subject, these images in some cases can become the source or axis, the hub of artistic creations; and as grim and severe as some of them may be, the greatness of these images is such that it is difficult to find equal pleasure in contemplating them. This second stage of the process can, I think, be called meta-historical contemplation.

The painting created in this way is similar to a canvas on which individual figures and, perhaps, their overall composition are clear, but the rest is yet to be revealed. Some figures are vague, and some spaces between them are unfilled. Some parts of the background or individual accessories are entirely absent. There arises a need to clarify the unclear connections and fill the wandering voids. The process enters the third stage, which is the most free from the influence of external and irrational factors. Therefore, it is clear that the most significant errors, incorrect interpretations, and too subjective interpretations occur precisely at this stage. The main obstacle is the inevitable distortion caused by the intervention of reason, which seems almost impossible to avoid. However, it is possible to sometimes redirect the work of reason towards the inner nature of meta-historical logic. This third stage of the process can be naturally called meta-historical comprehension.

Thus, meta-historical illumination, meta-historical contemplation, and meta-historical comprehension can be recorded as three stages of the path of cognition that is being discussed.

I would like to note the possibility of another kind of state, representing a variety of the states of the first hundred days. This is a type of illumination associated with the experience of meta-historical elements of demonic nature, some of which have enormous power and a vast sphere of influence. This state, which would be correctly called an infra-physical breakthrough of the psyche, is extremely painful and mostly saturated with a sense of peculiar horror. However, as in other cases, stages of contemplation and comprehension follow this state as well.

My books, written or currently being written on a purely poetic level, are based on personal experience of meta-historical understanding. The concept, which serves as the framework for these books, is entirely derived from this experience. Where did I get these images? Who and how implanted these ideas in me? How can I speak with such confidence? Can I give any guarantees about the authenticity of my experience? - Now, here, in one of the introductory sections of the book "The Rose of the World", I answer these questions as best I can. There is nothing attractive to me about autobiographical specifics, I try to keep them to a minimum. But this minimum includes, of course, a brief report on where, when, and under what circumstances I experienced hours of meta-historical enlightenment.

The first event of this kind, which played a huge, largely determining role in the development of my inner world, occurred in August 1921, when I was not yet fifteen years old. It happened in Moscow, at the end of the day, when I, who had already become very fond of aimlessly wandering the streets and daydreaming, stopped at a parapet in one of the parks surrounding the Cathedral of Christ the Savior and overlooking the embankment. Moscow residents still remember what a wonderful view opened up from there of the river, the Kremlin, and Zamoskvorechye with its dozens of bell towers and colorful domes. It was apparently already seven o'clock, and the church bells were ringing for evening prayer... - The event I'm talking about opened before me, or rather above me, such a turbulent, blinding, incomprehensible world, embracing the historical reality of Russia in a strange unity with something immeasurably greater than it, that for many years I was internally nourished by the images and ideas that gradually flowed into my consciousness from there. The mind could not deal with them for a very long time, trying to create new and new constructions that were supposed to harmonize the contradictory nature of these ideas and interpret these images. The process quickly moved into the stage of comprehension, almost bypassing the stage of contemplation. The constructions turned out to be erroneous, the mind could not keep up with the invading ideas, and it took more than three decades, filled with complementary and deepening experience, to correctly understand and explain the chasm that had opened up in early youth.

The second event of this kind I experienced in the spring of 1928 in the church of Pokrov in Levshino, for the first time staying after the Easter morning service for the early afternoon prayer. This service, which begins around two o'clock at night, is marked, as is known, by the reading - only once a year - of the first chapter of the Gospel of John: "In the beginning was the Word." The Gospel is intoned by all the priests and deacons participating in the service from different parts of the church, verse by verse, in different languages - both living and dead. This early afternoon prayer is one of the peaks of Orthodox - indeed Christian - and indeed world worship. If the preceding morning service can be compared to the rising of the sun, then this afternoon prayer is a true spiritual midday, fullness of light and universal joy. The internal event I am talking about was very different in content and tone from the first one: much broader, as if connected with the panorama of all humanity and with the experience of World History as a single mystical stream, it gave me through the solemn movements and sounds of the service being performed before me a sense of that highest realm, that heavenly world, in which our entire planet appears as a great Temple and where the eternal worship of enlightened humanity is continuously performed in indescribable splendor.

In February 1932, during my short-term service at one of Moscow's factories, I fell ill and acquired some experience at night, in fever, which, of course, most people will see nothing but delirium, but for me it was terrifying in its content and convincing in its authenticity. The entity to which this experience pertained, I referred to in my books and designate here with the expression "third uytsraor". The strange, completely non-Russian word "uytsraor" was not invented by me, but invaded my consciousness at that time. The very simplified meaning of this giant creature, similar perhaps to the monsters of the deep sea, but incomparably superior to them in size, I would define as a demon of a great power state. This night remained for a long time one of the most painful experiences I knew from personal experience. I believe that if we adopt the term "infra-physical breakthroughs of the psyche", it will be quite applicable to this experience.

In November 1933, I accidentally -- and I mean completely accidentally -- walked into a church in Vlasyevsky Lane. There, I stumbled upon an akathist to St. Seraphim of Sarov. As soon as I opened the entrance door, a warm wave of descending choral singing rushed into my soul. I was overcome with a feeling that is extremely difficult for me to describe, let alone express in such a formal style. An irresistible force made me kneel, even though I had not liked to participate in kneeling before: my emotional immaturity had previously led me to suspect that there was something slave-like in this movement. But now kneeling was not enough. And when my hands lay on the old, thousands of feet-worn rug, some secret door of the soul opened, and tears of incomparable ecstatic joy flowed uncontrollably. And, truth be told, I don't really care how experts in all kinds of ecstasies and admirations will name and classify what happened next. The content of these moments was a rise to Heavenly Russia, experiencing the Synod of its enlightened, otherworldly warmth of spiritual streams pouring from that focal point, which can be justly and accurately called the Heavenly Kremlin. The great spirit, who once walked on our earth in the form of St. Seraphim of Sarov, and now is one of the brightest luminaries of the Russian Synod, approached and bowed to me, covering me, like an epitrahil, with a tent of flowing rays of light and gentle warmth. For almost a year, until this church was closed, I went to the akathists to St. Seraphim every Monday and, amazingly enough, experienced this state every time, again and again, with undiminished strength.

At the beginning of 1943, I participated in the crossing of the 196th Infantry Division across the ice of Lake Ladoga and, after a two-day journey through the Karelian Isthmus, entered the besieged city of Leningrad late in the evening. During the journey through the deserted, dark city to the place where I was stationed, I experienced a state that partly resembled that youthful experience near the Savior Church in its content, but colored very differently: as if bursting through the specific atmosphere of a front-line night, it shone through it, and then absorbed it into itself, it was colored harshly and gloomily. Inside it, there was darkness and a shimmering opposition of irreconcilable principles, and their stunning scales and the gaping great demonic essence behind one of them inspired trembling horror. I saw the third uplift clearer than ever before - and only the shining from the approaching enemy - our hope, our joy, our defender, the great spirit-national leader of our homeland - saved my mind from irreparable breaking(^1).

____________
(^1): I tried to express this experience in the poem "Leningrad Apocalypse," but the laws of art required me to separate the threads of this experience. The opposing images that appeared simultaneously had to be depicted in a chronological sequence, and a number of elements had to be added to the overall picture that, although not contradictory to this experience, were absent in reality. One such productive addition was the bombing of the Engineer Castle (which I did not witness), as well as the concussion of the hero of the poem.

Finally, something similar but completely free from metaphysical horror was experienced by me in September 1949 in Vladimir, again at night, in a small prison cell, while my only comrade slept, and several times later, in 1950-53, also at night, in a common prison cell. The experience gained on this path of knowledge was not enough for the "Rose of the World". But the very movement along this path led me to the point where I was sometimes able to consciously perceive the influence of certain Providential forces, and these hours of spiritual encounters became a more perfect form of meta-historical knowledge than the one I just described.

The relatively common and well-known experience of the etheric body leaving the physical vessel while it rests in deep sleep, and traveling through other layers of planetary space. However, returning to waking consciousness, the traveler does not retain any clear memories of what was seen. They are only stored in the deep memory, completely separated from the consciousness of the vast majority. Deep memory (anatomically, its center is located in the brain) is a repository of memories of the pre-existence of the soul, as well as its trans-physical journeys, similar to the one described. The psychological climate of some cultures and the millennia-old religious-physiological practice directed in this direction, such as in India and Buddhist countries, contributed to the fact that the barrier between deep memory and consciousness weakened. If one abandons cheap skepticism, it is impossible not to notice that it is precisely in these countries that one can often hear, even from very simple people, statements that the realm of pre-existence is not completely closed to their consciousness. In Europe, which was first educated in Christianity, which set this problem aside, and then in irreligious science, nothing contributed to the weakening of the barrier between deep memory and consciousness, except for the individual efforts of rare individuals.

I must say quite frankly that I personally did not make even these efforts, for the simple reason that I did not know how to approach it, and I had no leaders. But there was something else, for which I am probably indebted to the efforts of invisible executors of the Providential will, namely, a certain openness, as if to a narrow gap, of the door between deep memory and consciousness. However unconvincing it may sound to the vast majority, I am not going to hide the fact that weak, fragmentary, but undeniably reliable flashes from deep memory have influenced my life since childhood, intensified in youth, and finally, at the age of forty-seven, illuminated the days of my existence with a new light. This does not mean that the organ of deep memory has been fully revealed - that is still far off - but the significance of the forms emanating from there has become so palpably clear to me, and the images themselves are sometimes so distinct, that the qualitative, essential difference between them and ordinary memories, as well as between them and the work of imagination, becomes undeniable. How can I not bow with gratitude to the fate that brought me into those conditions for a whole decade, which are cursed by almost everyone who has experienced them, and which were not entirely easy for me either, but which, at the same time, served as a powerful means of opening the spiritual organs of my being? It was precisely in prison, with its isolation from the outside world, its unlimited leisure, and its one and a half thousand nights spent by me awake, lying on a bed among sleeping comrades - it was precisely in prison that a new stage of meta-historical and trans-physical cognition began for me. The hours of meta-historical enlightenment became more frequent. The long rows of nights turned into continuous contemplation and reflection. Deep memory began to send ever more distinct images into consciousness, illuminating with new meaning both the events of my personal life and the events of history and modern times. And finally, waking up in the morning after a short but deep sleep, I knew that today the dream was not filled with dreams, but with something entirely different: trans-physical wanderings.

If such wanderings are carried out through demonic layers, and without a guide, and under the influence of dark impulses of one's own soul or the treacherous summons of demonic beings, a person, upon awakening, does not remember anything distinctly but carries with them a compelling, seductive, and pleasantly eerie feeling from the journey. From this feeling, like from poisonous seeds, deeds can grow that will bind the soul to these worlds long after death. Such wanderings happened to me in my youth, and these deeds pulled me along with them, and it was not my merit that the further radiant path of my life on earth led me farther and farther away from these breakdowns into the abyss.

If, however, the descent is made with a guide - one of the brothers of the Synclita country or the Synclita of the World, if it has a providential meaning and purpose, then the traveler, upon awakening and sometimes experiencing the same compelling, tempting feeling, at the same time realizes its temptation, not only that, but in his memories, he finds the opposite of this temptation: an understanding of the ominous meaning of the existence of these worlds and their true face, not a mask. He does not try to return to these lower layers through ethical decline in the plane of his waking life, but makes the acquired experience the object of religious, philosophical, and mystical understanding or even the material of his artistic creations, which have, among other values, an indispensable warning meaning.

At the age of forty-seven, I remembered and understood some of my transphysical wanderings that I had previously made. Before that time, memories of them were of a vague, fragmentary, chaotic nature that did not form any coherent whole. New wanderings often remained in memory as vividly, reliably, and emotionally as the opening of secrets does, as no dream, even the most significant one, remains in memory.

There is an even more perfect form of such journeys through planetary space: the same exit of the etheric body, the same travels with the great leader through the layers of the ascending or descending series, but with full preservation of waking consciousness. Then, upon returning, the traveler brings back memories that are even more certain and exhaustive. This is only possible if the spiritual sense organs are already widely opened and the barriers from deep memory are forever removed. This is true spiritual vision, which of course, I have not experienced.

As far as I know (though I may be mistaken), only Dante among European writers was involved in this. Creating the "Divine Comedy" was his mission. But the full opening of his spiritual sense organs only occurred at the end of his life, when the huge work on the poem was nearing its end. He realized numerous errors, inaccuracies, the lowering of meaning, and excessive anthropomorphism of the images, but there was no time or strength left to correct them. Nevertheless, the system he presented can be accepted in its main features as a panorama of the different material layers of Roman Catholic metaculture.

I dare not even mention anything like this, but I have had the great fortune of conversations with some who have long since left us and now reside in the Synclite of Russia. I can hardly touch on the absolutely stunning experiences of their real closeness with my pen. I cannot even name their names, but the closeness of each of them was colored in an uniquely individual tone of feeling. Meetings occurred during the day, in a crowded prison cell, and I had to lie down on my cot, facing the wall, to hide the flow of tears from overwhelming happiness. The closeness of one of the great brothers caused my heart to beat harder and my soul to tremble with solemn reverence. My entire being greeted another with warm, tender love, like a precious friend who sees through my soul and loves it, offering me forgiveness and comfort. The approach of the third evoked a need to bow before him, like a mighty one who has risen incomparably higher than me, and his closeness was accompanied by a strict sense of attention and unusual acuteness. Finally, the approach of the fourth evoked a feeling of exultant joy - a worldly joy - and tears of ecstasy. I can doubt many things, approach many things in my inner life with suspicion of their authenticity, but not these encounters.

Did I see them themselves during these meetings? No. Did they talk to me? Yes. Did I hear their words? Yes and no. I heard them, but not with my physical hearing. It was as if they were speaking from the depths of my heart.

Many of their words, especially the new names of the different layers of Shadanakar and hierarchies, I repeated before them, trying to convey their sounds as closely as possible to physical speech, and asked: is this correct? Some of the names and names had to be clarified several times; there were also some for which it was not possible to find a more or less accurate reflection in our sounds. Many of these otherworldly words, spoken by the great brothers, were accompanied by light phenomena, but it was not physical light, although in some cases they can be compared to lightning flashes, in others with glowing, and in others with moonlight. Sometimes these were not even words in our sense, but rather whole chords of phonetic harmony and meaning. Such words could not be translated into our language at all, it was necessary to take one from all the meanings - one from all the harmoniously sounding syllables.

But the conversations were not in individual words, but in questions and answers, in whole phrases expressing very complex ideas. Such phrases, without being broken down into words, as if flashed, imprinting themselves on the gray sheet of my consciousness, and illuminated with an extraordinary light that which was dark and unclear for me and which my question concerned. Rather, it was not even phrases, but pure thoughts that were conveyed to me directly, apart from words.

So, the path of meta-historical insights, contemplations, and reflections was supplemented by trans-physical journeys, encounters, and conversations.

The spirit of our time will not hesitate to ask: "While what the author calls experience may be accurate for the experiencing subject, can it have greater objective significance than the 'experience' of a patient in a mental hospital? Where are the guarantees?"

But it is strange: do we approach all phenomena of spiritual life, all cultural phenomena, with a demand for guarantees? And if not all, then why specifically these? After all, we do not demand guarantees of "accuracy" from a painter or composer for their musical inspirations and painterly visions.

There are no guarantees in conveying religious and, in particular, meta-historical experience. Without any guarantees, someone whose spiritual disposition is at least partially attuned to it will believe in the experience of another; they will not believe and will demand guarantees, and if they receive guarantees, it will not matter to someone who is alien to that disposition.

Only science insists on the obligatory acceptance of its own testimonies, forgetting how often its conclusions of today have been overturned by the conclusions of tomorrow. Other areas of the human spirit are free from obligations and internally boundlessly free: art, religion, and meta-history.

However, to mix these areas together, to assume, for example, that the meta-historical form of knowledge is some kind of original and rare variety of artistic creativity, would be the most primitive mistake. They may overlap at certain stages, but a meta-historical cognitive process is possible that is completely free of elements of artistic creativity, and processes of artistic creativity that have nothing to do with meta-history are truly countless.

But even in the realm of religions, only a few varieties have truly enriched themselves with meta-historical knowledge. Interestingly, in the Russian language, the word "откровение" (revelation) is literally equivalent to the Greek "апокалипсис" (apocalypse), but the latter has firmly established itself on Russian soil. At the same time, each of the two words has a special shade of meaning. The meaning of the word "откровение" is more general: if we do not confine ourselves to narrow confessional frameworks, we must include historical cases of revelation, such as the visions and raptures of Muhammad and even the enlightenment of Gautama Buddha. Apocalypse, on the other hand, is only one type of revelation: it is not about the realms of universal harmony, the sphere of absolute fullness, not even about the circle of stellar or other cosmic hierarchies; it is about the revelations of the fate of nations, kingdoms, churches, cultures, humanity, and the hierarchies that most effectively and directly manifest themselves in these fates: the revelation of meta-history. Apocalypse is not as universal as cosmic revelation, it is hierarchically lower, it is about something closer to us. But precisely because of this, it answers the burning queries of destiny, thrown into the crucible of historical cataclysms. It fills the gap between the comprehension of universal harmony and the dissonances of historical and personal existence. As is known, only a few peoples and in a few centuries were rich in this revelation: apocalypticism arose among the Jews, apparently around the 6th century BC, captured early Christianity, and lingered longest in medieval Judaism, feeding on the burning atmosphere of its messianism.

In Christianity, particularly in the Eastern tradition, the apocalyptic form of knowledge was almost completely lost in the early Middle Ages, only to suddenly reemerge in the dim, flickering, smoldering flame of the first century of the Great Russian Schism. It would be inappropriate to delve into the complex and numerous causes of this damage, but it is impossible not to note its connection with the anti-historicism of religious consciousness and the world of religious feelings, which captures our attention as far back as the Byzantine Church Fathers and is even striking in representatives of Russian Orthodoxy, even in the greatest and most spiritually experienced individuals whose righteousness and highest spiritual experience cannot be doubted. Anti-historicism becomes almost a mandatory canon of religious thought. It is instructive to recall the unresolved conflicts between the official anti-historicism of Russian church worldview and the innate, irrational attraction to the apocalyptic form of knowledge, to metahistory, in the spiritual and creative biographies of secular Orthodox writers and thinkers: Gogol, Khomyakov, Leontiev, Dostoevsky, Vladimir Solovyov, and Sergei Bulgakov.

But the consolation is that the touch of metanarrative can be realized in a completely different way than it was discussed here. This is evidenced by the element of metahistorical experience, which can often be found under the enormous thickness of anti-historicism - whether apparent or genuine. The feeling wonderfully conveyed by Tyutchev, when the individual feels like a participant in some historical mystery, a participant in the work and struggle of great spiritual - or rather, transphysical - forces, powerfully manifested in the fateful moments of history - could Joan of Arc have accomplished her feat without this feeling? Could St. Sergius of Radonezh - despite his true anchoretic and ascetic worldview - have taken such a decisive, even guiding part in the political storms of his time? Could the most significant of popes throughout the centuries have attempted the idea of a universal hierocracy, or Loyola have created an organization consciously seeking to master the mechanism of historical development without this feeling? Could Hegel, with his mind alone, have created the "Philosophy of History," or Goethe - the second part of "Faust"? Would the self-immolation of the Old Believers have been imaginable if the icy wind of eschatological, metahistorical terror had not cooled in them every attachment to this world, which had already fallen under the power of the Antichrist, as they believed? The vague metahistorical feeling, not enlightened by contemplation and reflection, often leads to distorted concepts and chaotic actions. Do we not sense some metahistorical pathos in the pompous speeches of the leaders of the French Revolution, in the doctrines of utopian socialism, in the cult of Humanity of Auguste Comte, or in the calls for universal renewal by destroying all established order - calls that take on in the mouth of Bakunin the tone that recalls the passionate appeals of the Jewish prophets, even though the orator of the 19th century invests these appeals with a new, even opposite to the worldview of the ancient prophets, meaning? Hundreds more such questions could be asked. The inevitable answers to them will lead to two important conclusions. First, it will become clear that in the general volume of both Western and Russian culture, the subconscious layer of apocalyptic experiences can be found in an innumerable number of phenomena, even those that at first glance seem foreign to it. And secondly - the meta-historical sense, the meta-historical experience, unconscious, vague, confused, contradictory, is constantly woven into the creative process: artistic, religious, social, and even political.

Speaking about the meta-historical method of cognition, I unconsciously switched to the transphysical one: the travels and encounters that I described partly relate to the areas of transphysical cognition. After all, I have already mentioned that these phenomena cannot always be clearly classified; this would not be necessary at all if we did not want to bring some clarity to a complex and poorly researched series of issues.

Perhaps some may express surprise: why do I use the term "transphysical" so often instead of the commonly understood word "spiritual"? But the word "spiritual" in its strict sense can only be related to God and monads. The term "transphysical," on the other hand, is applied to everything that has materiality but of a different kind than ours, to all the worlds existing in spaces with a different number of coordinates and in other streams of time. I understand by transphysics (in terms of the object of cognition) the totality of such worlds regardless of the processes taking place there. Such processes related to the formation of Shadanakar constitute meta-history; those related to the formation of the Universe constitute meta-evolution; the cognition of meta-evolution is universal cognition. The term "transphysics" in terms of religious doctrine means the doctrine of the structure of Shadanakar. Objects of meta-historical cognition are connected with history and culture, those of transphysical with the nature of our layer and other layers of Shadanakar, and those of universal with the Universe. Thus, the phenomena that I called transphysical travels and encounters can be attributed, depending on their content, either to the meta-historical kind of cognition or to the transphysical or universal kind.

After this brief clarification, nothing prevents us from moving on to the consideration of the two remaining types of religious cognition - but, of course, only in those variants that are personally familiar to me.

### Chapter 2. A little about the transphysical method.

It would seem that people's attitudes towards nature are infinitely diverse, individual, and sometimes internally contradictory. However, if we trace the evolution of this relationship throughout the universal history of culture from the invention of writing to the present day, we can identify several types or, better to say, phases of it. I will allow myself here, in a very simplified way and in the most general terms, to outline three or four very important phases as they appear to me. This is not a true picture of how this relationship has changed in cultures and centuries, but rather a few rough strokes aimed more at introducing the reader to the problem than at creating a historical perspective on the issue.

The earliest phase is characterized by the fact that the cosmos seems extremely small, and Earth is the only inhabited world. However, this world, in addition to our physical layer, has a number of other layers that are also material, but their materiality is of a different nature and properties than ours; the first approximation to the transphysical reality of Shadanakar. All these layers, like ours, are devoid of development. They were created once and for all and are inhabited by good and evil beings. For these beings, humans are the center of their interests and, so to speak, the apple of discord. The human being does not perceive Nature as something outside of him/her and does not oppose himself/herself to it. Individual manifestations of Nature, of course, arouse various feelings - fear, pleasure, awe, but Nature as a whole, apparently, is almost not perceived or perceived only in a purely aesthetic sense, and even then only by some individuals who are highly gifted with artistic sensibility. Therefore, it is rare to find among the monuments of art of these epochs the lyrical poetry of nature and even less so - landscape painting. This phase is mainly associated with ancient cultures, as well as some later cultural forms of the East. In religious terms, polytheism is characteristic of the first phase.

The second phase is characterized by those monotheistic systems that either ignore Nature, showing no interest in it, or are hostile towards it. Personal growth leads to the belief that humans can improve themselves. Nature, on the other hand, shows no signs of development, it is inert and static, amoral and irrational, it is under the control of demonic forces, and the part of the human being that is united with Nature either enslaves it or is enslaved by it. This is the phase of "conquering Nature." Christian, Buddhist, and Hindu nations have gone through this phase; Judaism, as long as it coincided with its national religion, also stopped at this phase. However, Semitic sense of Nature was generally impoverished. It has long been noted how poor the authors of the biblical books and the Quran were in terms of this feeling compared to those who created the great epics of Greece and especially India. Semites paid an inevitable tribute to Nature, endowing the reproduction of the species with religious sanction, but in their spiritual philosophy and art, they tried to ignore it with ambiguous consistency. They made sculpture and portrait painting practically impossible because they were afraid of deifying humans and hated the deification of the elements. Like other elements of Semitism, this tendency to conquer Nature passed to Europe with Christianity, suppressed the natural cults of Germanic and Slavic paganism, and prevailed until the end of the Middle Ages. But the East also had to go through this phase, although it colored it in its own way. The asceticism of extreme manifestations of Brahmanism, the struggle of Buddhism for the liberation of the human self from the power of Nature - all this is too well-known to dwell on. Thus, if in the first phase Nature as a whole was almost not perceived, but was poeticized and deified in its separate manifestations, then in the second phase it was recognized as a hostile beginning, submissive to demonic forces.

The third phase is associated with the era of scientific dominance and the depletion of the world's religious feelings. Inheriting from Christianity a naturalistic principle, the person of the third phase frees it from religious meaning, refuses to overcome natural elements in one's own being, and justifies a strictly utilitarian approach to nature. Nature is an object of rational (scientific) investigation, firstly; it is a conglomeration of soulless forces that must be subdued for human needs, secondly. The physical outlook is infinitely broadened; knowledge of the structure and laws of our layer reaches dizzying depths; this is the value of the third phase. However, it is in vain to talk about the love of nature among naturalists. Intellectual love can only be experienced towards the products of the intellect: one can love an idea, thought, theory, or scientific discipline with their mind. Thus, one can love physiology, microbiology, even parasitology, but not lymph, bacteria, and fleas. Love for nature can be a phenomenon of physiological order, aesthetic order, finally - ethical and religious order. It cannot be only one kind of order: intellectual. If individual naturalists love nature, then this feeling has no connection with either their specialty or generally with the scientific methodology of the knowledge of Nature: this feeling is of a physiological or aesthetic order. However, civilized (at least Western) humanity achieved the greatest opposition to Nature not in the 20th century, as it might seem, but in the 17th, 18th, and early 19th centuries. Fashions have never been as artificial as in the era of powdered wigs. Nearby areas of Nature have never been deformed so rationally and unnaturally as in the era of the Versailles park. The aristocrats of the time of the Ludovicians cannot imagine taking a sunbath or walking barefoot, just as it is impossible to imagine a Spartan woman of the Greco-Persian wars wearing a corset and high-heeled shoes. All of this manifested an attitude towards Nature that genetically rooted in Christian asceticism but replaced spiritual snobbery with civilization snobbery, religious pride with pride of reason, and, in general, not marked with the stamp of rationality, did not experience anything except mocking contempt.

Rousseau's philosophy represents a turning point. However, it took a century and the world had to enter the era of giant cities for the longing for nature to become understandable to the majority of people. Poets of the Lake School in England, Goethe and the Romantics in Germany, Pushkin and especially Lermontov in Russia loved nature with a high aesthetic and sometimes pantheistic love. The Barbizon School of painting emerged, and by the end of the 19th century, aesthetic love had won an unshakable right to existence in culture. In the 20th century, physiological love also developed. Visual contemplation of nature became insufficient: there was a need to feel the elements tangibly and motorically, with the whole surface of the body and the movement of muscles. This need was partly met by tourism and sports, and finally, in the first half of our century, the beach, with its physiological dissolution of man in sunlight, warmth, water, play, tightly and firmly entered into everyday life. That same beach, which in the time of Ronsard or Watteau would have seemed like a shameless act of madmen, and in the Middle Ages would have been equated with the witch's sabbaths on Bald Mountain and, perhaps, the black mass. If we imagine Torquemada, suddenly transported as a spectator to the beach in Ostend or Yalta, there can be little doubt that the thought of an immediate auto-da-fé of thousands of these shameless heretics would immediately arise in the mind of this guardian of human souls.

Perhaps nothing illustrates the decreasing gap between humans and the elements over the last century as vividly as the evolution of clothing.

Coats and headwear, which were once a constant presence even on a hot summer day for the "cultured" person, are now only worn as needed for the climate. Fifty years ago, it seemed indecent to leave the house without gloves, but now they are only used in cold weather. Instead of frock coats and starched cuffs, which our grandfathers wore even in thirty-degree heat, life is now being conquered with sleeveless tops and open collars. Feet, once cramped in high boots, now appreciate the comfort of slippers and sandals. Women have been freed from the nightmare of corsets and wear short and open dresses in the summer, while long dresses survive only as evening attire. Children, whose great-grandfathers at a corresponding age solemnly walked in gymnasium jackets and with a kepi on their heads, now run barefoot, in only their shorts, kissed black by the sun. The human of the global city, who has distanced themselves from Nature like never before, yearns for her "hot embrace" and returns to her, almost unconsciously, with instinctive bodily love, but carrying the seeds of a new, more perfect relationship with Nature in the accumulated historical experience of their soul. This is the fourth phase.

So, there are four phases: pagan, ascetic, scientific-utilitarian, and instinctive-physiological.

Here's the English translation:

One can summarize as follows: by the second half of our century, two attitudes towards nature had become established in the educated and semi-educated layers of the nation belonging to the Roman Catholic, German Protestant, and Russian cultural zones, which hardly contradicted each other. One was the old utilitarian-economic-scientific attitude, completely alien to love. It focused on the use of natural resources and measured everything by the criterion of material benefit for humanity or, worse still, for some of its antagonistic parts; from this point of view, it also approves of sports, the beach, and tourism. Supporters of this attitude, out of interest in "how it works?" will calmly cut open live cats and dogs, and lurk for hares and grouse to satisfy their atavistic hunting instincts. Perhaps in the first case, love for humanity is also meant: because from the dog corpses of Mont Blanc, finally a morsel of knowledge is extracted, such as conditioned reflexes; this enlightens the thirsty mind and moves medicine forward. But there is not even a shadow of love for nature here. Moreover, such an attitude towards nature is immoral because no interests of living beings other than humans are taken into account, and because the entire nature is viewed as a milk cow. Fortunately, this attitude is beginning to soften - a newer one: unconsciously-selfish-physiological love for nature, sometimes complicated by aesthetics. But this development has not yet led to the realization that it is possible and necessary to enrich this relationship with ethical and religious meaning, while maintaining old shades of love for nature, except of course for the amoral-utility attitude towards it. Not pantheistic, when a person only vaguely senses the presence of some impersonal, evenly distributed divine power in nature - no. This has already been, and primitive animism is proof that the pantheistic feeling of civilized people is nothing more than the transformation of the oldest experience of arungvility-prana. No! What we have here is something else. What we have here is an incomparably more moral and conscious, clearer, more developed and sophisticated, more joyful, more active attitude. It can only be based on that experience when a person directly feels the richest and most diverse worlds of elementals through nature. She feels - that is, she engages in communication, understanding more and more the possibilities of a happy and creative friendship with them, the beauty of our duty before them, and the bitter, ancient guilt we carry.

Truth be told, a vague sense of guilt towards Nature, particularly towards animals, began to take effect. Societies for the protection of animals emerged, love for them was encouraged even in school pedagogy, and the protection of greenery was taken on by such a renowned source of love as the state. Unfortunately, in doing so, it was only based on the consideration of economic benefit. As for the protection of animals, benefactors received a harsh lesson from natural scientists: after heated discussions, vivisection systematically took its place in science as one of the leading methods. Justifying themselves with the benefit for humanity, this shame of humanity firmly established itself in universities, laboratories, and even in the very middle school that teaches children to love cats and dogs.

What would be the attitude towards Nature from the worldview that could form the basis of the teaching of the Rose of the World?

The question is very broad; however, it is easy, I think, to conclude what the main characteristic of this relationship will be. After all, the perception of the Rose of the World is characterized primarily by the feeling of transparency of the physical layer, the experience of the layers of transphysics shining through it, a passionate love for this experience, and its careful cultivation. This feeling covers the sphere of culture and history - and is reflected in the meta-historical teaching; it turns to the Sun, Moon, and the starry sky - and becomes the basis of the teaching of the universal, that is, the meta-evolutionary; it encompasses the earthly nature - and finds its expression in the teaching of the elementals. The teaching of the elementals, in turn, turns out to be a branch of a more general teaching about the structure of Shadanakar - the teaching of transphysicality.

No matter how much ancient beliefs about elementals (spirits of the elements in the broadest sense) were muddied by the side effects introduced by the limitations of human imagination and understanding, no matter how much aberrations distorted the images of natural deities in the pantheons of polytheistic religions, the truth lies at the very foundation of these beliefs.

However, of course, we must comprehend and revere the worlds of elementals in a completely different way than it was possible for ancient peoples. The experience of subsequent stages has enriched us, expanded our knowledge, and sharpened mystical thought.

The main differences between our belief in elementals and the belief of the ancients are as follows. The ancients anthropomorphized their ideas about elemental deities; we no longer feel the need to give elementals a human-like image. The ancients viewed these worlds as something forever given and unchanging; we are aware of their evolution, although it is not similar to the evolution of our organic world, and we will strive to understand its paths.

The ancients could experience a connection with individual layers of elementals, but they indistinctly distinguished them from each other, and they did not even have a guess about the ways of the monads' development. In fact, they did not have a clear idea of the plurality of these layers. For us, the plurality and interconnection of these layers and the paths of development of the monads living there become the object of transphysical knowledge.

The ancients were unable to depict a general picture of the planetary cosmos; we much more clearly differentiate each layer and include it with all its specific features in the overall panorama of Shadanakar.

The ancients could not reconcile their belief in these worlds with the belief in the One; for us, there is no contradiction between these two beliefs.

And it should be added that the ancients saw their spiritual obligations towards elementals in appeasing and praising them - and that's it; we will strive to establish our connection with them by being ready to participate in their games and creativity, by attracting their benevolent participation in our lives - the possible ways to achieve this will be shown in the relevant chapters - and, finally, in our own assistance to the bright elementals and in working towards the enlightenment of the dark ones.

This attitude towards Nature combines pagan joy of life, monotheistic spirituality, and the breadth of knowledge of the scientific era, embodying all these elements into a higher unity through personal spiritual experience of the emerging religion's outcome.

There is a widespread misconception that any religious worldview is hostile to life, replacing all the values of our world with the values of other worlds. Such a generalization is no more valid than, for example, the claim that painting art takes one away from the world, based on the fact that this was partly true in the Middle Ages. The creed of a certain phase of religion may be hostile to life, but only in its extreme manifestations. The same worldview I am talking about does not take one away from the world but teaches to love it with passionate and selfless love. It does not oppose "other worlds" to this world but perceives them all as a magnificent whole, like a necklace on the chest of God. Do we like a crystal lamp less because it is transparent? Will we love our world less because other worlds shine through it? For a person who feels this way, this life is good, and death can be not an enemy but a kind guide if a life well-lived on Earth determines the transition to other worlds that are no less, but even more rich and beautiful.

But how is this permeating worldview achieved by a human being? Does it come independently of our will, like a lucky gift of fate, or can it be consciously cultivated in ourselves and in whole generations?

As long as the combined efforts of many people are not directed towards such cultivation, the joy of a permeating worldview remains, indeed, a mercy of God, and we almost do not expend any effort to obtain it. Only through the long labor of our invisible heart friends, the carriers of the Providential will, do the organs of such perception open up in someone, and more often, they only partially open to a narrow slit. But even such partial openness is enough to start the permeation of the physical world and to make the one who is blessed by it resemble a blind person who can suddenly see.

It is hardly possible to initiate this process arbitrarily, whether in oneself or in others, at least not now. However, we can work in this direction so that in each of us or our children, this labor goes towards the work of providential forces, so that in the psycho-physical layers, a tunnel seems to break through simultaneously from both sides: us and our heart's friends.

The colossal task of such pedagogy can only be predicted as one of the tasks of a future cultural era. There is still a huge preliminary work needed to study and systematize experience. I will elaborate on this in more detail in one of the last parts of the book. For now, I will only provide a few necessary pieces of information about two or three possible variations of this methodology. These and many other variations, not mentioned here, can, of course, be combined and assist each other.

There is one preliminary condition without which no efforts in this direction would lead to anything. This is a person's readiness to achieve the merging of that crystalline vessel, which we call Nature. Therefore, this process is accessible only to those who allow for the possibility of the existence of elemental worlds (without this, one can wish for the merging of the physical layer, but only, on the contrary, so that nothing comes of it, in order to triumph over my scientific skepticism). Or for children, if trust in the elements and love for Nature are strengthened from an early age by elders. Naturally, those who deny the existence of these worlds will not spend time and effort on such experiments. And even if, as an experiment, they decided to make some efforts, they would not achieve anything because their own mistrust would constantly spread to the results obtained, and they would attribute these results to self-hypnosis or something similar. Taking a step forward is taking a step back. Stuck in place.

So, if the necessary internal condition is present, it is necessary to take care of creating the necessary external conditions. It is easy to guess that we are talking about such periods (one and a half to two months a year) when a modern person, freed from work for the sake of their livelihood, can afford to be alone in nature. It seems to me that the conditions are more favorable in the summer, because it is precisely in the summer, with the high position of the sun, the development of vegetation, and the exposure of the earth's surface and water spaces, that the activity of the elements is multiplied many times over by the participation of new and new layers of them. Not to mention the fact that city dwellers usually go on vacation in the summer, that is, they have the opportunity to communicate with nature for at least a month. Although, it must be said directly, a month is not enough to make much progress, and attempting such efforts in two-week vacations is completely useless. I should also note that for some of us, winter nature is individually closer, and in such cases, of course, one should take this predisposition into account.

Perhaps someone is expecting precise instructions from me, like getting up at a certain time, going to bed at a certain time, adhering to a certain daily routine. I would prefer to avoid such trivial recommendations. What is the task? To enter deeper into nature, into the life of the elements, and to do so not as a destroyer or a curious experimenter, but as a son returning home after many years of wandering in a foreign land. To solve such a task, what is natural and useful for one individual may not be so for another. I would only like to share what conditions have personally helped me.

Choosing a beautiful and, of course, sparsely populated place as a "base" for this time, it was necessary, first of all, to avoid cluttering the soul and mind with petty worldly concerns. It was necessary to weaken ties with the big city, use the radio less frequently, and try to do without newspapers as much as possible, unless, of course, the world was in a state of extreme unrest. It was necessary to simplify one's life, make clothes as light as possible, and forget about the existence of shoes altogether. Bathing two or three times a day in a river, lake, or sea, finding a place where you could be alone with nature for this time. Read books that promote peaceful, friendly moods and sometimes help your thoughts immerse themselves in the depths of nature; scientific literature cannot be useful in such days, as it sets a completely different tone: it further leads one away from the exact sciences and technology. It is better to read good poetry, some classics of literature: Turgenev, Dickens, Erckmann-Chatrian, Tagore (but, of course, not such writers as Stendhal, Zola, Swift or Shchedrin). It is good to reread classic children's literature at this time, such as "Tom Sawyer" or "Children of Captain Grant," and literature about children. And frequent communication, games, and conversations with children at this time can only help. Perhaps I will scare some off with one instruction, but unfortunately, it is absolutely firm: to minimize meat and fish consumption and to refrain from abundant wine consumption. And - an absolutely unconditional requirement: that there be no hunting or fishing whatsoever.

In such an atmosphere, journeys began: it's hard to call them "walks" or "excursions." These were whole-day escapes, from dawn to dusk, or for three or four days with overnight stays in the woods, wandering along country roads and field paths, through meadows, forestry, villages, farms, slow river crossings, chance encounters, and casual conversations, with overnight stays - by a campfire by the river, in a clearing, in a haystack, or somewhere on a rural hayloft. I actively avoided proximity to cars, technical conversations, and reading similar literature, except occasionally using mechanical transport. Then, I would return to my secluded "base," rest for a few days, listen to the crowing of roosters, rustling of leaves, and voices of children and hosts, read peaceful, deep, and frequent books, and set off again on such wandering. This lifestyle may sometimes cause confusion or teasing; understanding is not expected, and people occupied with rural work may even see such a strange person as an idle wanderer. Most peasants, for now, only know how to consider their own work as essential. This should not be disturbing. You must be able to disregard other people's opinions if you feel you are right. But all of these are instructions on the external. You can roam the woods and fields all summer to exhaustion, but return with nothing. External conditions must be supplemented with some mental and emotional efforts. What are they?

In gradually getting used to perceiving the noise of the forest ocean, the swaying of grass, the flow of clouds and rivers, all the voices and movements of the visible world as living, deeply meaningful, and friendly to it, the feeling that invariably reigns over the change of other thoughts and feelings will intensify, as if, leaning backwards, you lower your head lower and lower into the flickering, softly-lit, rocking depth - eternal, loving, and native. The feeling of clear joy, wise tranquility will absorb the slightest splash of fuss; it is good on such days to lie, without counting time, on the riverbank and aimlessly watch the cool water sparkling in the sun. Or, lying somewhere in the midst of an old pine forest, listening to the organ-like sound of the treetops and the tapping of the woodpecker. You have to trust that the poetry of the Liurna is already rejoicing in you and will speak to your body as soon as it descends into their flowing flesh; that the poetry of the Fal'tory or Arashamfa is already singing you songs of rustling leaves, buzzing bees, and warm air currents. When you return home at sunset through the flood meadows smelling of freshly cut hay, climbing up the warm air of hills and descending into cool valleys, and the quiet fog begins to flood everything except the tops of the haystacks, it's good to take off your shirt and let the hot body be caressed by this fog, which is created by those who weave it over the sleepy meadows. There could be hundreds more of such moments - from sunbathing on the sand to picking berries - semi-action, semi-contemplation, but those who embark on this easy and light path will guess them without guidance. After all, such a lifestyle is possible not only in Central Russia but also in the natural landscape of any other country, from Norway to Ethiopia, from Portugal to the Philippines and Argentina. Accordingly, only details will change, but they can also change within the same landscape according to personal inclinations. The main thing is to create this lightness and light within oneself and repeat similar periods, if possible, every year.

"What absurdity," some will think. "As if we do not have exhaustive data on the origin of fogs, winds, dew, and the mechanics of rain, rivers, and vegetation. And such fairy tales are presented with a serious face in the middle of the 20th century! No wonder the author hints that it is easier for him to explain to children: a mature person should not listen to such tales.

These absolutists of the scientific method of cognition are mistaken: there is no slightest contradiction to science here. I emphasize: to science, objective and serious, not to the philosophical doctrine of materialism.

After all, if there were some reasonable microscopic creature studying my body and everything entering it, it would have a basis for saying, at the moment when I moved my hand, that this mass of matter consisting of such-and-such molecules jerked because some of its parts contracted - the muscles. And they contracted because such-and-such a reaction occurred in the motor centers, and the reaction was caused by such-and-such causes of a chemical nature. That's it! Clear as day. And, of course, such an interpreter would be outraged if anyone dared to suggest that the "mass" moved because it was the desire of its owner, a free, conscious desire, and that the muscles, nerves, chemical processes, and so on were only a transmission mechanism of his will.

Physiology studies this mechanism. This does not prevent the existence of psychology - the science of that consciousness that uses this mechanism.

Meteorology, aerodynamics, hydrology, and a number of other sciences study the elements of nature as mechanisms. This should not and will not prevent the emergence over time of a doctrine of elementals - those consciousnesses that use these mechanisms."

Personally, everything started for me on a hot summer day in 1929 near the town of Tripolye in Ukraine. Happily tired from a long walk through open fields and hills with windmills, where there was a vast view of the bright blue arms of the Dnieper River and the sandy islands between them, I climbed to the crest of another hill and suddenly I was literally blinded: before me, motionless under the waterfall of sunlight, there stretched an immense sea of sunflowers. At that same moment, I felt as though an invisible sea of exultant, living happiness was quivering above this splendor. I stepped to the edge of the field and, with a pounding heart, pressed two rough sunflowers against both my cheeks. I looked ahead at these thousands of earthly suns, almost suffocating with love for them and for those whose joy I felt above this field. I felt something strange: I felt as though these invisible beings were joyfully and proudly leading me, as a dear guest, almost to their own amazing celebration, reminiscent of a mystery and a feast. I cautiously took two steps into the thick of the plants and, closing my eyes, listened to their touch, their barely audible ringing rustle, and the divine warmth everywhere. That's how it started. True, I remember experiences of this kind related to earlier years, of childhood and adolescence, but they were not yet so gripping then. However, both before and after that moment, not every year, but sometimes several times in one summer, there were moments of strange, intoxicating joy among nature. They mainly occurred when hundreds of miles had been left behind, walking, and when I unexpectedly found myself in unfamiliar places marked by lush and riotous vegetation. Completely overwhelmed with delight and trembling, I pushed my way through wild thickets, sun-soaked swamps, and whipping bushes, and finally threw myself into the grass to feel it all over my body. The main thing was that during those moments, I distinctly felt how the invisible beings whose existence is mysteriously linked to this vegetation, water, and soil loved me and flowed through me. In the following years, I spent most of my summers in the area of the Bryansk forests, and a lot happened to me there, the memory of which brings joy to my life. But I especially love to remember my encounters with the elementals of Liurna - those whom I then mentally called the souls of rivers.

Once I went on a solo journey through the forests of Bryansk for a week. There was a drought, and the forest fires had left a haze of bluish fibers, with white, slowly shifting smoke rising above the pine groves. For many hours, I had to trudge along a hot, sandy road without encountering any sources of water. The oppressive heat, like that of a greenhouse, caused a tiresome thirst. I had a detailed map of the area with me, and I knew that I would soon come across a small stream, so small that it was not even marked on the map. And indeed, the character of the forest began to change, with the pines giving way to maples and alders. Suddenly, the scorching road, which burned my feet, slid downwards, and ahead I saw the green meadow, and, rounding a pile of trees, I caught sight of the long-awaited stream: the road crossed it ford. What a pearl of the universe, what a delightful child of God laughed at me! A few steps wide, completely covered by the low-hanging branches of old willows and alders, it flowed as if through green caves, playing with myriad sunbeams and murmuring barely audibly.

Throwing my heavy backpack onto the grass and hastily shedding my clothes, I waded into the water up to my chest. And when my hot body plunged into this cool moisture, and the sway of shadows and sunlight quivered on my shoulders and face, I felt that some invisible entity, woven from who knows what, enveloped my soul with such sinless joy, with such laughing cheerfulness, as if it had loved me for a long time and had long waited for me. It was all like the finest soul of this river, all flowing, all quivering, all caressing, all consisting of coolness and light, carefree laughter and tenderness, joy and love. And when, after a long stay of my body in its body, and my soul in its soul, I lay down, closing my eyes, on the shore under the shade of spreading trees, I felt that my heart was so refreshed, so cleansed, so pure, so blissful, as it could have been in the early days of creation, at the dawn of time. And I understood that what had happened to me was not just an ordinary swim, but a real washing in the highest sense of the word.

Perhaps someone would say that they too lived in the forests and swam in the rivers, and wandered through the woods and fields, and stood on the lek of a capercaillie, experiencing a sense of unity with nature, but yet they did not feel anything resembling stihii. If a hunter were to say this, there would be no cause for surprise: stihii are seen by nature destroyers as enemies and polluters, and there is no surer way to make their closeness impossible than to bring a hunting rifle into the woods. If, however, this is said by someone who is not a hunter, let him recall with care the weeks of his life spent in nature, and he will discover his own violations of the conditions I warned about from the very beginning.

Of course, the duration of these stages of knowledge cannot be determined in advance: the time frame depends on many objective and personal circumstances. But sooner or later, the first day will come: suddenly you will feel all of Nature as if it were the first day of creation, and the earth will revel in its heavenly beauty. This can happen at night by a fire, or during the day in a rye field, in the evening on warm porch steps, or in the morning on a dewy meadow, but the content of this hour will be the same everywhere: a dizzying joy of the first cosmic insight. No, this does not yet mean that inner vision has opened up: you will not yet see anything other than the familiar landscape, but you will experience its multi-layered and spiritually saturated essence with your entire being. For those who have passed through this first insight, stihii will become even more accessible; they will increasingly hear the everyday closeness of these wonderful beings with some unnamed abilities of the soul. But the essence of the "first insight" is already in something higher, which I have not been able to find another name for besides the old word "universal". This type of state has been illuminated by many authors in specialized literature. William James calls it a breakthrough of cosmic consciousness. Apparently, it can have very different shades in different people, but the experience of cosmic harmony remains its essence. The method I have described in this chapter is capable of bringing this moment closer to some extent, but one should not hope that such joys will become frequent visitors to the home of our soul. On the other hand, this state can envelop the soul without any conscious preparation: for example, Rabindranath Tagore describes such a case in his "Reminiscences".

It can easily happen that a person who has experienced a sense of universal harmony in nature will think that this is what I am talking about. Oh no. The breakthrough of cosmic consciousness is an event of colossal subjective significance, which can be very limited in the life of one person. It comes suddenly. This is not a mood, not pleasure, not happiness, it is even more than that. The stunning effect will not be its own, but rather the memory of it; itself is filled with such bliss that it is more correct to speak in connection with it not about shock, but about enlightenment.

This state consists of the fact that the Universe is not just the Earth, but the Universe itself opens up in its highest plane, in that divine spirituality that permeates and encompasses it, removing all painful questions about suffering, struggle, and evil.

In my life, this occurred on the night of the full moon on July 29, 1931, in the same Bryansk forests, on the bank of the small river Nerussa. Usually, I try to be alone in nature, but this time it so happened that I took part in a small group excursion. There were several of us - teenagers and young people, including a budding artist. Each had a knapsack with supplies, and the artist also had a travel album for sketches. No one was wearing anything except a shirt and pants, and some even took off their shirts. We walked silently and quickly, like the way African natives walk on animal trails, not hunters, not scouts, not seekers of useful minerals, but simply friends who wanted to spend the night by the fire on the famous Nerussa glades.

The vast pine forest, like the sea, was replaced by a black forest, as always in the Bryansk forests along the river valleys. There were ancient oaks, maples, and ashes that surprised with their slimness and height, as well as birches resembling palms with crowns at dizzying heights; at the very water's edge, the round tents of kind-hearted willows shone, hanging over the backwaters. The forest approached the river with loving caution: with individual groups, clearings, and meadows. There were no villages or forestry... The emptiness was only disturbed by our barely noticeable path, left by the mowers, and by the rounded cones of haystacks that stood out in some places among the clearings, waiting for winter, when they will be taken to Chukhraji or Neporen by sleigh.

We reached the clearing in the evening hours of a hot, cloudless day. After a long swim, we collected firewood and, having made a fire two meters away from the quietly flowing river and sheltered by the shade of three old willows, we prepared a simple dinner. It was getting dark. From behind the oaks emerged a low July moon, completely full. Little by little, the conversations and stories quieted down, and one by one my companions fell asleep around the crackling fire, while I remained awake, swaying a wide branch to protect myself from the mosquitoes.

And when the moon entered the circle of my vision, silently moving behind the intricately narrow leaves of the spreading willow branches, those hours began that remain among the most beautiful of my life. Breathing quietly, lying flat on a pile of hay, I heard how Nerussa flowed not behind me, a few steps away, but as if through my own soul. This was the first extraordinary experience. Triumphantly and silently, everything that was on earth and everything that could be in heaven flowed into the stream that flowed through me, and everything I could think of or imagine was encompassed in a jubilant unity. These ancient forests and transparent rivers, people sleeping by fires, and other people - nations of nearby and faraway lands, morning cities and noisy streets, temples with sacred images, seas that incessantly sway, and steppes with swaying grass - truly everything was in me that night, and I was in everything. I lay with my eyes closed. And beautiful, not at all like what we usually see, white stars, large and blooming, also floated with the world river, like white water lilies. Although the sun was not visible, it seemed as if it, too, flowed somewhere close to my circle of vision. But it was not with its radiance, but with a different light, never before seen by me, that all of this was permeated - everything that flowed through me and at the same time rocked me like a child in a cradle, with an all-soothing love.

Trying to express feelings like this, you see more clearly than ever the poverty of language. How many times have I tried, through poetry and prose, to convey to others what happened to me that night. And I know that any attempt, including this one, will never make another person understand the true meaning of this event in my life, nor its scope, nor its depth.

Later, I tried with all my might to relive that experience. I recreated all the external conditions under which it happened in 1931. Many times in subsequent years, I slept in the exact same place, on the same kind of nights. It was all in vain. It only came back to me so suddenly, twenty years later, not on a moonlit night on a forest river, but in a prison cell.

Oh, this is just the beginning. This is not the enlightenment after which a person becomes, as it were, different, new - enlightened in the highest sense in which this word is understood by the great peoples of the East. That enlightenment is the most sacred and mysterious: it is the revelation of spiritual eyes.

There is no greater happiness on Earth than the full opening of internal vision, hearing, and deep memory. The happiness of a deaf and blind person who suddenly experiences the opening of physical vision and hearing in mature years is only a dim shadow.

I can only repeat, so to speak, what I have heard. There is a wonderful page in Edwin Arnold's poem "The Light of Asia," which describes the state that made one seeker, now known to all humanity as Gautama Buddha.

Here is the description.

It refers to Buddha's entry into the state of "abhijna" - a broad insight "into spheres that have no names, into countless systems of worlds and suns moving with astonishing regularity, myriad after myriad ... where each luminary is an independent whole and at the same time a part of the whole - one of the silvery islands in the sapphire sea, rising in endless aspiration for change. He saw the Lords of Light who hold the worlds with invisible bonds, and themselves meekly move around more powerful luminaries, moving from star to star and casting constant radiance of life from eternally changing centers to the very limits of space. He saw all this in clear images, all cycles and epicycles, the whole series of kalpas and mahakalpas(^1) - to the limit of time that no one can grasp with their mind. Sakual upon sakual(^2), he penetrated into the depth and height and saw beyond all spheres, all forms, all luminaries, every source of movement. That immutable and silently acting Great One, according to Whom darkness must develop into light, death into life, emptiness into fullness, formlessness into form, good into something better, something better into perfection; this unspeakable Great One is stronger than the gods themselves: It is immutable, inexpressible, and supreme. This is the creative, destructive, and recreating power, directing everything to good, beauty, and truth."

What do you say to this? To hope, even in the most secret corner of the soul, that someday such an hour will come upon you too, would not be pride, but simple childishness. And yet, the comfort in knowing that every human monad, without exception, sooner or later, even after almost infinite time, may reach this state, perhaps in a completely different, non-human form, in another world, surpass it, and leave it behind.

And our task is to share with others the best that we have. My best is what I experienced on the paths of transphysical and meta-historical knowledge. This book is written about that. In the last two chapters, I showed how I was able to reach the most important milestones on my inner journey. All further writing will be an exposition of what was understood on this path about God, other worlds, and humanity. I will try not to return to the question of how it was understood; it is time to talk about what was understood.

### Chapter 3. Original Concept

#### Multilayeredness

Our physical layer, which is conceptually equivalent to the astronomical Universe, is characterized, as is known, by having three coordinates in Space and one coordinate in Time, in which it exists. In the terminology of the Rose of the World, this physical layer is called Enrof.

In the arena of modern science and philosophy, the debate over the infinity or finiteness of Enrof in space, its eternity or temporal limitations, and whether Enrof encompasses the entire universe, and whether all forms of existence are exhausted by its forms, is still ongoing.

The discovery of the concept of antimatter, the emergence of physically material particles from physical emptiness, and even their artificial extraction from it, which had hitherto existed in the world of negative energy, as well as the experimental confirmation of the theory indicating that the physical emptiness of Enrof is filled with an ocean of particles of another materiality - all these facts are milestones on the path that slow-moving science follows from the classical materialism to those which are very different from them, and from the positions of the old idealistic philosophy. It is very likely that the confusion that supporters of materialistic philosophy introduce into this problem, claiming that all its opponents only repeat the old ideas of idealism, is one of the tactics in the last battle that materialistic consciousness gives before retreating, as they say, to the brakes, surrendering one of their positions after another and insisting at the same time that this was precisely what the classics of materialism had foreseen and long proclaimed. In particular, it will be very interesting to see what maneuvers this philosophy will resort to in the near future when it will have to introduce the concept of antimatter into the circle of its concepts under the pressure of facts.

Primacy of matter over consciousness, the fundamental comprehensibility of the entire universe and at the same time its infinity and eternity - these naive theses of materialism, developed in past stages of science, can still be held in circulation only through strained tensions, and most importantly - thanks to the intervention of forces related not so much to philosophy as to the police system. However, many of the theses of classical religions do not stand up to the scrutiny of modern science to the same extent. On the other hand, the new knowledge, meta-historical and trans-physical, while not covering the field of scientific knowledge, essentially does not contradict science in anything, and in some questions anticipates its conclusions.

The concept of the multi-layeredness of the Universe is at the heart of the concept of the Rose of the World. Under each layer is understood a material world, the materiality of which is different from others either by the number of spatial or temporal coordinates. Next to us, for example, there exist adjacent layers, the Space of which is measured by the same three coordinates, but the Time of which has not one, as we have, but several dimensions. This means that in such layers Time flows in several parallel streams of different rates. An event in such a layer occurs synchronously in all its temporal dimensions, but the center of the event is in this or two of them. It is certainly not easy to imagine this. The inhabitants of such a layer, although they act primarily in one or two temporal dimensions, exist in all of them and are aware of them all. This synchronicity of being gives a special sense of the fullness of life, unknown to us. Slightly ahead of the course of the exposition, I will add now that a large number of temporal coordinates in combination with a minimum (one, two) number of spatial ones becomes for the inhabitants of such layers, on the contrary, a source of suffering. This is similar to the awareness of the limitation of one's means, with a burning sense of powerless anger, with a memory of tempting opportunities that the subject is unable to take advantage of. A similar state in Enrof some of us would call "biting elbows" or the torment of Tantalus.

With rare exceptions, such as Enrof, the number of temporal dimensions exceeds, by far, the number of spatial dimensions. In Shadanakar, there appear to be no layers with more than six spatial dimensions. However, in the higher layers of these worlds, the number of temporal dimensions reaches a huge figure - two hundred and thirty-six.

It would be wrong to assume that the specific features of Enrof apply to other layers, as if all barriers separating one layer from another are necessarily as impermeable as those separating Enrof from layers of other dimensions. There are barriers that restrict access to a single layer and are even less penetrable, isolating it more densely from the rest. However, there are very few of them. There are many more groups of layers where transition from one layer to another requires the being only special internal conditions and not death or the most difficult material transformation, as with us. There are also those where transition to neighboring layers requires no more effort than, say, moving from one earthly state of Enrof to another. Several such layers make up a system. I am used to mentally calling each such system of layers or series of worlds an Indian term sakuala. However, there are also single layers, like Enrof.

Layers and entire sakualas differ from each other in the nature of the extent of their space. Not all of them have the cosmic extent that Enrof has. As difficult as it may be to imagine, the space of many of them fades at the boundaries of the solar system. Others are even more local: they are, as it were, confined within the limits of our planet. There are even many that are not associated with the planet as a whole, but only with some of its physical layers or sections. There is nothing resembling the sky in these layers, of course.

Being connected to each other by common meta-historical processes, and possessing, for the most part, a pair of opposing spiritual poles, all layers of each celestial body constitute a vast, closely interacting system. I have already mentioned that such systems are called bramfaturas. The total number of layers in some of them is limited to a few, while others have several hundred. In addition to Shadanakar, whose total number of layers is now 242, there are now bramfaturas of the Sun, Jupiter, Saturn, Uranus, Neptune, the Moon, and some of the large planets' satellites in the solar system. The bramfatura of Venus is in its infancy. The other planets and satellites are as dead in their other layers as they are in Enrof. These are the ruins of the extinct bramfaturas, abandoned by all monads, or never having been bramfaturas at all.
Multilayered material systems, to some extent similar to bramfaturas but incomparably more colossal, encompass some star groups, for example, most of the stars of Orion or the double system with many planets, the Antares stars: even more colossal are the systems of galaxies and the entire Universe. These are macro-bramfaturas. It is known that there are macro-bramfaturas with a huge number of different material layers - up to eight thousand. There is nothing resembling the extreme material rarity, the so-called "void" of Enrof, in macro-bramfaturas.

It is easy to understand that the macrocosms are beyond the reach of even the greatest human souls currently inhabiting Enrof. Without any concrete information, only distant premonitions can be directly gleaned about them. Such information sometimes reaches us from the high spirits of Shadanakar, immeasurably greater than us, through the intermediaries of invisible friends of our hearts. But even such messages are extremely difficult for our perception. For example, it was almost impossible for me to understand the strange and mournful news that there is a material layer in the macrocosms of our galaxy where there is space but no time - something like a hole in time, but with its own movement. This is the suffering of great demons, the kingdom of dark eternity, but not in the sense of endless time, but in the sense of the absence of any time. Such eternity(^1) is not absolute, because time can arise there, and this is one of the tasks of the huge cycles of cosmic formation. This is because only the emergence of time will make it possible to free the great sufferers trapped there.

____________
(^1): I would like to note in passing that the difference between the two meanings of the word "eternity" is still very little understood by our philosophical thought.

Molecules and some types of atoms are part of tiny systems - microcosms, some of which have an incredibly short existence in time. However, these are quite complex worlds, and it should not be overlooked that elementary particles are living beings, and some of them have free will and are quite rational. But communication with them, and even more so personal penetration into microcosms, is practically impossible. There is currently no being in any of the layers of Shadanakar capable of this - it still exceeds even the power of the Planetary Logos. Only in the macrocosms of the Galaxy do spirits of such unimaginable power and greatness act that they are able to simultaneously descend into a multitude of microcosms: for this, such a spirit must, while maintaining its unity, simultaneously embody itself in millions of these tiniest worlds, manifesting itself in each of them with complete completeness, albeit in infinitely small units of time.

I am always talking about, in one way or another, material layers because there are no spiritual layers as such. The difference between spirit and matter is more of a stage than a principle, although spirit is created only by God, emanating from Him, while materiality is created by monads.

In its primary state, the spirit, not clothed in any covers that we could call material, represents a substance that we can only compare to the finest energy in the order of a first approximation. Only God and the monads are spiritual - an innumerable multitude of divine and god-created higher Is, indivisible spiritual units that differ from each other by the degree of their innate potential scale, the inexhaustible variety of their material coverings, and the path of their lives. A highly elevated monad can be in many places in the universe at once, but it is not omnipresent. But the Spirit of God is truly omnipresent - He is even present where there are no monads, such as in the ruins of Bramfatura abandoned by all monads. Nothing can exist without Him, not even what we call dead physical matter. And if the Spirit of God were to abandon it, it would cease to exist - not in the sense of transitioning to another form of matter or energy, but completely.

#### The origin of evil. - World laws. - Karma.

If the myth of the rebellion and fall of Lucifer is considered in relation to the spiritual history of Shadanakar, it loses its meaning. There have never been any events in the meta-history of our planet that could be reflected in the events of this myth. Something else happened once, a long time ago, about which memories, although very distorted, have been preserved in some other myths, for example - in the tale of the rebellion of the Titans. However, it is necessary to talk about this in more detail in another context.

As for the legends associated with the rebellion and fall of Lucifer, these events occurred once in the universal plane, on scales exceeding all categories of our minds, in the macrocosm that encompasses the universe. What happened, when translated by ancient seers into the plane of epochal human concepts, was cast into this myth. Epochal concepts have died out, our ideas have expanded immeasurably, and if we now want to grasp the immortal and true seed of the idea in this myth, we must disregard all epochal elements introduced into it and focus only on one central fact it asserts.

Naturally, even the wisest consciousness of those times was so far removed from current ideas about the size and structure of the Universe that the understanding of the cosmic, which seeped into their consciousness thanks to the efforts of invisible friends of their hearts, was crushed and compressed into the narrow confines of their empirical experience, their strong but unenriched and unrefined minds. However, it is no easier for those who are now trying to express in human concepts and words even a reverberation of the cosmic mystery of the rebellion of the so-called Deneb. Such an attempt would consist of two stages: first, searching for those concepts in the ocean of our ideas that are closer than others to reflecting this transcendent reality, and second, searching for word combinations in the ocean of our language that are capable of reflecting these elusive concepts in turn. But such work is connected with the organic growth of the personality and its cosmic experience. It cannot be forced by one's own whim. I feel that I am only at the beginning of this work. Therefore, I cannot say anything about universal events of this magnitude, except for the naked statement of a fact that once occurred: in the immemorial depths of time, a certain spirit, one of the greatest, called by us Lucifer or Deneb, expressing the freedom of choice that is inherently inherent in every monad, departed from his Creator for the sake of creating another universe according to his own plan. Many other monads, large and small, joined him. They began to create worlds within this one. They tried to create worlds, but these worlds were fragile and collapsed because, in rebelling, the apostate monads rejected love—the only unifying, cementing principle. The providential plan of the Universe leads many monads to the highest unity. As they ascend the steps of existence, the forms of their unions are perfected, and love for God and each other brings them closer and closer together. And when each of them is immersed in the Sun of the World and co-creates with Him, the most perfect unity is realized: merging with God without losing their unique selves.

The universal plan of Lucifer is opposite. Each of the monads that adhere to him is only his temporary ally and potential victim. Each demonic monad, from the greatest to the smallest, nurtures a dream - to become the ruler of the universe. Pride suggests to it that it is potentially stronger than everyone else - it is precisely it. It is guided by a kind of "categorical imperative," expressed to some extent by the formula: I am and there is non-I; all non-I must become me, in other words, everything and everyone must be absorbed by this one, absolutely self-affirming I. God gives Himself; the anti-divine element strives to absorb everything into itself. That is why it is primarily a vampire and a tyrant, and that is why the tyrannical tendency is not only inherent in any demonic self, but is an integral part of it.

Therefore, demonic monads unite temporarily with each other, but essentially they are not rivals for life, but for death. With the capture of local power by their group, this contradiction is soon revealed, mutual struggle begins, and the strongest wins.

The tragedy for demons in the course of space struggle is also due to the fact that the Lord creates new and new monads, while demons are incapable of creating even one, and the balance of power is continuously increasing not in their favor. No more new apostasies are committed and will never be committed again, there are absolute guarantees of this, and I deeply regret that the exceptional difficulty of this problem does not allow me to find the necessary set of concepts to present it in a somewhat reasonable way. In any case, all demonic monads are of very ancient origin, all of them are ancient participants in the great rebellion. True, not apostasies, but something externally similar: highly conscious beings, sometimes even a whole group of them, temporarily oppose themselves to the Providence's will. But this godless choice is made not by the monad itself, but by the lower Self, the limited consciousness of the soul. Therefore, its godless activity takes place not in the spiritual world, but in the material worlds subject to the law of retribution, which is subject to the will of the demons themselves. Thus, this rebellion is already doomed, and the one who committed it embarks on a long path of redemption. Gradually, in the course of the struggle, the demons themselves began to understand the futility of their attempts to create their own universe. While continuing to create separate worlds and making incredible efforts to strengthen their existence, they also set themselves another goal: to seize the worlds that are already existing or are currently being created by the Providence's forces. The goal is not the destruction of the worlds, but their seizure, but the destruction of the worlds is an objective consequence of such seizure. Deprived of the unifying principle of love and co-creation, cemented only by the contradictory principle of violence, worlds cannot exist for any significant length of time. There are galaxies that are collapsing. And when astronomical observations of extragalactic nebulae cover a longer period than they do now, the processes of these global catastrophes will be revealed to the eye of science. There are perished and perishing planets: Mars, Mercury, Pluto - the ruins of Bramfatura; all monads of Light were expelled from these systems, which fell under the demonic domination, after which the final catastrophe followed, and the demonic hordes were left homeless, wandering in the world space in search of a new object of invasion.

But there are brafmaturas and whole galaxies that the forces of the uprising could not invade. Within our galaxy, there is a system completely freed from demonic elements, Orion - a brafmatura of extraordinary power of spiritual Light. The same person who contemplates the great Andromeda nebula in a reflector will see another galaxy firsthand, which has never known demonic invasions. This is a world that rises from beginning to end through stages of increasing bliss. Among the millions of galaxies in the universe, there are many such worlds, but unfortunately, our galaxy is not among them. The forces of the Uprising, long ago expelled from the brafmaturas of the universe, lead an incessant, tireless struggle in the worlds of our galaxy, acquiring millions of forms to fight against the forces of Light; the arena of the struggle was also Shadanakar.

It became such an arena even in those distant times when the Earth in Enrofe was a semi-molten sphere, and the other layers of Shadanakar, which were still counted by single-digit numbers, were only created by the great hierarchies of brafmaturas. There was no law of devouring there: there, in the worlds of beings now known to us under the general name of angels, the principle of love and friendship of all prevailed. There was no law of death: each one passed from layer to layer through material transformation, free from suffering and not excluding the possibility of return. In these worlds, which then had only three dimensions of space and were therefore almost as dense as Enrof, there was no law of retribution, but mistakes were corrected with the help of higher powers. The glimmers of memories of this, rising from the treasuries of the deep memory into the consciousness of ancient sages, but reduced and simplified by their consciousness, led to the crystallization of the legend of the lost paradise. In reality, it was not a paradise, but a beautiful dawn, and it did not shine over the earthly Enrof, which was still devoid of organic life, but over the world now called Olirna, which shone then and remained in the memory of those few human monads who did not come to Shadanakar later, like most of them, but began their journey in it in times more ancient than antiquity, and not in Enrof, but in the angelic Olirna. This fellowship of proto-angels can be called, in a sense, the first humanity of Shadanakar.

Great demon, one of the followers of Lucifer, invaded Shadanakar with armies of lesser demons. His name is Gagtungur. It was a long and persistent struggle; it ended in his partial victory. He was unable to drive the forces of Light out of Bramfatura, but he managed to create several demonic layers and turn them into impregnable citadels. He managed to interfere with the process of the emergence and development of life on earthly Enrof and put his mark on the animal kingdom. Planetary laws, through which the forces of Light began to create organic life on Enrof, were unrecognizably distorted. It is false and blasphemous to attribute laws of mutual consumption, retribution, and death to the deity. "God is Light and in Him there is no darkness."

From God comes salvation only. From Him comes joy only. From Him comes grace only. And if the laws of the world strike us with their cruelty, it is because the voice of God in our soul rises up against the work of the Great Tormentor. The mutual struggle of demonic monads, the victory of the strongest, not the one who is more right, and the overthrow of the defeated into the abyss of torment - this law of Luciferian forces is reflected in the face of the organic world of Enrof, expressed here in the law of "struggle for existence". Every creature's suffering, every pain and torment it endures gives off radiation - here in Enrof, and there in the afterlife. Every feeling, every agitation of its spiritual nature cannot but give corresponding radiation. Radiation of anger, hatred, greed, and lust of animals and humans penetrate the demonic layers, replenishing the loss of life force among different classes and groups of their inhabitants. But these radiations are barely sufficient to replenish the loss of strength precisely in individual demonic communities. But the radiation of suffering and pain - it is called gavvah - is capable of saturating giant crowds of demons of almost all species and ranks. Essentially, gavvah is their food. Laying his paw on the laws of Shadanakar, Gagtungur distorted them to generate and multiply suffering. He made them burdensome, cruel, and intolerable. He prevented the establishment of the law of transform in Enrof; as the resultant of both warring forces, death arose and became the law. He hindered the principle of universal friendship; as the resultant of both forces, mutual consumption arose and became the law of life. And finally, the demonic forces interfered in the life of other layers of Shadanakar - those through which the path of beings who have ever been incarnated in earthly Enrof passed: these layers were turned into worlds of retribution, where torturers reign, feeding on the sufferings of the tormented. Among the various types of gavvah, the one associated with the flow of physical blood is of particular importance. When the blood of humans and animals flows out of the body, in the first minutes of this process, it emits a burning radiation of special power. Therefore, some classes of demons are interested not so much in the death of living beings in Enrof or in the afterlife suffering of their souls but precisely in bloodshed. No bloodshed in history has occurred or occurs without our unconscious suggestion of these otherworldly bloodsuckers.  And bloody sacrifices in some ancient cults were terrible not only in their cruelty, but also in that they nourished not the gods, of course, but precisely these demons.

To replenish the Light’s strength with the Planetary Logos, the first and greatest Monad of Shadanakar, a new layer was created and a new humanity was born. Enrof was left to the animal kingdom, while the new layer was populated by Titans, resembling us in appearance but enormous and magnificent. In a world resembling Enrof, but still dim, their luminous figures moved against a blue-gray, leaden sky, over the slopes and curves of desert mountains, perfecting them. The humanity of the Titans numbered a few thousand. They were without gender, and the birth of new ones was not linked to the union of two elders. But Gagtungur managed to incite their rebellion against Providence. Their idea was that they were the seed and nucleus of a new world beginning, the third, opposed to both God and demons. They thirsted for the absolute freedom of their egos but loathed the cruelty and malice of the demons. The rebellion ended with Gagtungur's forces using the law of retribution to plunge the souls of the Titans into deep torments. Their torture lasted for over a million years until, with the help of Providential forces, they managed to break free. Now most of them follow their path among humanity, standing out against the common background with the scale of their personality and a special somber, though not dark, coloration. Their creativity is marked by a vague memory of the struggle against the gods, as if scorched by ancient fire, and impresses with its power. Their spirits are distinct from the demonic Monads with their impulse towards the Light, contempt for the base, and thirst for divine love(^1).

____________
(^1): Among the figures of world culture, I could name several such names: Aeschylus, Dante, Leonardo, Michelangelo, Goethe, Beethoven, Wagner, Ibsen, Lermontov, Leo Tolstoy.

In the last millennia before Christ, Gagtungur's power was so great that in the afterlife layers of many meta-cultures of humanity, retribution lost its temporary nature. The way out of torment was firmly closed for the suffering, and hope was taken away from them.

This law of retribution, the iron law of moral causes and effects, the effects of which can manifest themselves in current life but are fully manifested in the afterlife and even in subsequent incarnations, can be called karma in Indian terminology. Karma is the same resultant of two opposite wills as the law of death and the law of struggle for existence. If the demonic forces did not encounter constant obstacles from their enemies, the laws would be even heavier, because the demonic purpose of laws is to generate the gavvahs and paralyze the manifestations of fallen souls of Light subject to them. The laws have another side, their purifying value. This is the remnant of the oldest bright grandlaws who pacified beautiful hierarchies; the goal of these hierarchies and all the bright forces of Shadankar is to soften and enlighten the laws; the goal of the demonic forces is to make them even heavier.

The purpose of Providence is to save all victims. The purpose of Gagtungur is to turn everyone into victims. The divine-humanity of the next world period will be a voluntary unity of all in love. The devil-humanity, apparently, will not be avoided at the end of the current period, and will be an absolute tyranny of one.

The cosmos is a field of becoming monads. Anticosmos is a universal union of opponents and a gathering of injured bright monads captured by demons in worlds over which they rule. These captives have been deprived of their most sacred attribute: freedom of choice.

The universe of Gagatungur is not bothered by the incomparability of its scale with the scale of Lucifer. Like all demonic monads, it understands its smallness only as a stage. Blind faith in its boundless growth and victory is inseparable from its ego. Any of these monads, no matter how miniature it may be at present and whatever subordinate position it may occupy in the hierarchy of the rebellious, believes in its impending macro-galactic triumph. Therefore, any of them, including Gagatungur, is a tyrant not only in principle and not only at the moment, but at every stage to the extent that the power achieved at this stage allows.

Tyranny causes such an abundant secretion of hawwah (an Arabic word for a type of energy associated with demonic power) like no other principle of leadership. The absorption of hawwah increases the reserve of demonic power. If a demon began to replenish the loss of its strength by infusion of other psychic emissions - joy, love, self-sacrifice, religious awe, enthusiasm, happiness - this would transform its nature, and it would cease to be a demon. But that is precisely what it does not want. Only tyranny, and only tyranny can tame the centrifugal forces inside the subordinate demonic sets. And that is why acts of apostasy and reverse uprising of individual demonic monads against Gagatungur occur occasionally in meta-history (and reflectively - in history).

Such rebellions, supported by the forces of Light, cannot be, because any such monad is potentially such a planetary demon. If it were stronger than Gagatungur, it would become an even greater torturer than he. However, it should not be forgotten that cases of the uprising of individual demonic monads are not so rare, not against Gagatungur as such, but against the demonic world order in general. Such rebellions are nothing more than demonic monads turning to the Light, and it is clear that they are then given all-round assistance by the Providential forces.

Despite the satanic wisdom of Gagatungur's global designs, these designs are fragile precisely because of the reasons mentioned, since the chances of taming all the demonic monads in the world, and in the future Lucifer himself, for a planetary demon are vanishingly small.

Despite all the satanic wisdom of the world plans of Gagtungur, these plans are precarious precisely because of the reasons mentioned. The chances of subduing all the demonic monads of the world, and in the future even Lucifer himself, for a planetary demon are disappearingly small. But the insatiable desire for universal domination constitutes the only source of understandable joys for him: he experiences such joys every time the slightest private victory seems to him a step closer to the ultimate goal. And these victories consist in enslaving other monads or their souls: demonic ones - as semi-allies, semi-slaves, light ones - as prisoners and objects of torment. As far as Gagtungur can imagine the cosmic future, he portrays himself as a kind of sun around which countless monads revolve in concentric circles, falling into it one after another and being absorbed - and gradually the whole Universe comes to this state of rotation around him, plunging, world after world, into a monstrously swollen hypermonad. The demonic mind is powerless to imagine further. Even the smaller of these monads are unable to draw even such an apotheosis. Unwaveringly believing in their ultimate victory over the Universe, they concentrate their will and thought on closer, more easily imaginable stages.

#### On the Question of Free Will

There is a certain prejudice, a particular mindset, that is common among many people today, as it has been carefully instilled into the consciousness of entire nations over the course of four decades. It is a way of thinking that leads the thinker to a conclusion that eventually becomes an axiom, a dogma: that religion takes away a person's freedom, requires blind obedience to higher powers, and places them completely under their control. And since these powers are mere phantoms, in reality dependence on all too real human authorities who seek to exploit the ignorance of the masses is strengthened. This is what "religious slavery" entails, from which humanity is liberated by science and materialistic philosophy.

To dispute this argument is to write a treatise with the aim of refuting the foundations of materialistic philosophy. Such treatises have already been written, and if they are still not well known in Russia, it is due not so much to philosophy as to politics.

As for the assertion that every religion demands submission to higher powers, there is no doubt that some religious doctrines do indeed preach predestination and the actual absence of free will in humans. This is a fact, and I am the least inclined to defend any form of religion indiscriminately. However, it is no more legitimate to generalize this trait to all religions in general than it is to claim, for example, that world literature is inherently reactionary and to justify this by citing individual reactionary writers and schools.

I would like to immediately clarify the injustice of such an accusation against the concept of the Rose of the World. First of all, I would like to express my confusion: no science or philosophy(^1), including materialistic ones, disputes the fact of human will's dependence on a multitude of material causes.

____________
(^1): Apart from subjective idealism.

It is precisely materialistic philosophy that insists on the complete dependence of the will on economic factors. And yet, no one is outraged by this diminishing of human agency in the face of natural and historical necessity. No one cries out against the enslavement of human beings to the law of gravity, the law of conservation of matter, the laws of evolution, economic development, and so on. Everyone understands that within these laws there is still sufficient room for the manifestation of our will.

However, the true concept of will does not add any new, additional factors to the list of factors that determine our will. It is not a matter of their number, but of their interpretation. That boundless and infinitely diverse realm that is united by the expression "higher powers" affects our will not so much by means of supernatural intrusions, but rather with the help of those very series of laws of nature, evolution, and so on, which we have just agreed to consider as objective facts. These series of facts largely determine our consciousness, and not only our consciousness, but also our subconscious and superconscious. Hence the emergence of those voices of conscience, duty, instinct, and so on, which we hear within ourselves and which visibly determine our behavior. This is the mechanism of the connection between "higher powers" and our will.

True, there are sometimes phenomena that subjectively may seem like violations of the laws of nature by "higher powers." These are called miracles. But where such phenomena really occur, and are not aberrations, there is no violation of natural laws by the "arbitrariness" of higher powers, but rather the manifestation of these powers through a series of other laws that are still unclear to us.

What often appears to us as a monolithic, simple, indivisible engine of our actions, for example, conscience, is in fact a very complex result of different series. In essence, conscience is the voice of our monad. But its access to the sphere of our consciousness is conditioned by the influence of other series: external circumstances, for example, some event that served as a push for this voice of the monad to be heard by us - this is the manifestation of Providence, the action of the forces of Providential nature.

Thus, a person's choice is predetermined by three series of forces. Providential forces that use the laws of nature and history as their instruments, gradually enlightening them; demonic forces that use the same laws and increasingly burden them; and the will of our own monad, presented to our consciousness through the voices of our heart and mind with the help of Providential forces.

Therefore, whether we consider the laws of nature and history as mechanical, soulless necessities or as tools of various living, personal, immaterial, or spiritual entities, the degree of our freedom will not decrease or increase. From the perspective of the Rose of the World concept, the degree of human choice and freedom is no less than that of materialism, but the factors that determine it are interpreted differently and more clearly articulated. And if the limitation of our freedom by completely impersonal and soulless laws of nature does not offend the materialist, then how can the limitation of our freedom by the will of Providential forces humiliate us? We can only be offended by the limitation of our freedom by the will of demonic forces; yes, it is offensive, but these are the very forces, our archenemies, the subjugation, transformation, and enlightenment of which is our entire goal. And we will stop experiencing this offense only when we make ourselves impervious to their influence. The evolution of world life leads ranks of beings from the minimal degree of freedom in the simplest forms (the voice of the Monad hardly reaches the rudimentary consciousness of a microbe, and its behavior is mainly determined by demonic forces acting through the laws of nature, as their transmission mechanism). Higher animals are already much freer than microbes, and the amplitude of their voluntary actions is much wider; in humans, it increases incomparably. Critics of religion as such point out that it requires renunciation of personal will, requires submission of our will to the deity. And they are right in relation to some religions of the past. But the Rose of the World is not a religious teaching of the past. It is a religious and socio-ethical teaching of the future. The Rose of the World does not require any "submission" to the will of God, because only what is done voluntarily by a person is valuable, not by coercion. The demand for slavish submission to the will of the deity will not be heard from the sanctuaries of the religion of the future. From there will emanate the call for universal love and free deification.

The Lord is an unchanging and ineffable supreme aspiration, a spirit-creating power that acts in all souls, never ceasing even in the depths of demonic monads, guiding worlds and worlds, from microcosms to super-galaxies, towards something more perfect than good and higher than bliss. The higher the level of each self, the more fully its will coincides with the creative will of the Lord. And when it, having started its cosmic path from the simplest forms of living matter, passes through the stages of human demiurge, planet and star demiurge, and galaxy demiurge, it will, through the Son of God, be immersed in the Father, and its will will fully coincide with the will of the Father, its power with the power of the Father, its image with the image of the Father, and its creativity with the creativity of the Father.

Theurgy is the bright creativity of all monads of the ascending stream of the Universe, from humans, poets, and enlightened animals to the demiurges of galaxies, unimaginably giant beings. That is why the word "demiurge" is so often used here, which was hardly used in ancient religions. Demiurges are all those who create for the glory of God, out of love for the world and its First Creator.

He is absolutely good. "He is omnipotent," added the old theology. But if He is omnipotent, He is responsible for the evil and suffering in the world. Therefore, He is not good. It seems impossible to break out of this circle of contradiction.

But the Lord creates from Himself. All monads that flow from His depth have the properties of this depth, including absolute freedom. Thus, divine creativity itself limits the Creator, defining His power by the line beyond which lie the freedoms and powers of His creations. But freedom is freedom precisely because it includes the possibility of different choices. And in the being of many monads, it was determined by their negative choice, their affirmation only of themselves and their apostasy from God. Hence what we call the evil of the world, hence suffering, hence cruel laws, and hence the fact that this evil and suffering can be overcome. The laws protect the world from turning into chaos. The demons themselves are forced to reckon with them, so that the worlds do not disintegrate into dust. Therefore, they do not overthrow the laws, but they burden them. The laws are blind. And they can be enlightened not in a moment, not by a miracle, not by external intervention of the Deity, but by a long cosmic path of overcoming the evil will of apostate monads.

God's all-embracing love and inexhaustible creativity are merged into one. All living things, including humans, approach God through three divine qualities inherent in them: freedom, love, and theurgy. Theurgy is the goal, love is the way, freedom is the condition.

Demoniacal monads are free, like all others, but their love is deeply harmful. It is directed exclusively inward: the demon loves only himself. And therefore, since the entire mighty stock of love residing in his spirit is concentrated on this one, the demon loves himself with such great force that no human can love himself.

The ability to create cannot be lost by demonic monads. But theurgy causes nothing but extreme hostility in them. Every demon creates only for himself and in his own name.

A person's creativity becomes God-creation from the moment and to the extent that their irresistible creative impulse is directed by the effort of their will and faith not towards achieving selfish goals such as glory, pleasure, material success, or serving cruel and base doctrines, but towards serving God with love.

The three words - freedom, love, and God-creation - define the attitude of the Rose of the World towards art, science, education, marriage, family, nature, and even neglected elements of life such as its improvement and beauty by all religions.

#### Being and Consciousness

The discussions of centuries-old dispute about the primacy of consciousness or being have brought us to a new perspective. Idealistic schools formulated the idea that "consciousness determines being". In the subsequent secular phase of culture, this formula was turned inside out, but its material remained intact. However, the material consisted of the opposition of two terms, and therefore the new formula inherited the primitivism of its predecessor.

The question is more complex than these formulas suggest. And yet, it is simpler than the cumbersome structures of propositions and conclusions that were piled up in the 18th and 19th centuries in order to extract such a modest result.

"Being determines consciousness" ... "Consciousness determines being" ... Whose being? Whose consciousness? Of an individual person? Of humanity? Of the world? Of living, conscious matter? How confused and vague it all is.

The consciousness of an individual person (for simplicity, we will only talk about humans) is determined not by someone else's consciousness or by being in general, but by a sum of factors. Namely:

1. their own physical being;
2. the being of their natural and cultural environment;
3. the consciousnesses of the multitude of people who live and have lived, for these consciousnesses largely 4. determined the cultural environment in which the individual lives and which affects their being and consciousness;
4. the consciousness of a large number of other beings who have influenced the natural environment and transformed it;
5. the being and consciousness of peacekeeping hierarchies;
6. the superconscious, but individual content that is inherent in the monad of the given person;
7. the being-consciousness of the One, in which being and consciousness are one, not different, opposing categories.

If the question is not about an individual person with their being and consciousness, but about the Universe, or more precisely, about the emergence of consciousness in the organic nature of any worlds, then it is clear that since the Universe is determined by the One, this opposition of being and consciousness is lifted for the reason just mentioned. And since the Universe is determined by the creativity of the god-created monads, the question of some moment of the appearance of consciousness in it after a period of unconsciousness loses its meaning. For if there were no god-created monads with their consciousness and being, then no matter, neither organic nor inorganic, could have arisen.

One could only jokingly make fun of the primitiveness of the classical formulas if one of them, becoming a philosophical dogma of political despotism, had not been responsible for countless misfortunes, clogging the airways of thought like a cork.

Another of the classic formulas, equally erroneous, is nonetheless less dangerous precisely because it is more spiritual. But this does not absolve the old religions with their philosophers of guilt: to spend so many centuries on scholastic musings and not take a single step closer to the question of the primacy of being or consciousness.

#### The non-material structure of a human

Among the numerous layers of Shadanakar, there is a multidimensional world where human monads reside - indivisible and immortal spiritual units, the higher self of humans. Created by God and only by God, and some (few) mysteriously born by Him, they enter Shadanakar, cloaked in the finest matter - which would be more correctly called energy: it is a substance that permeates all of Shadanakar; each individual spirit, entering our Brahmfatura, inevitably becomes clothed in it.

The world in which our monads reside is called Iroln.

The creative work leading to the enlightenment of the Universe is the task of each monad, except for demonic ones; among humans, there are no demonic monads. Human monads carry out this work in the lower worlds subject to their enlightening creativity, creating material domains for themselves there and through these domains, influencing the environment of the corresponding layers.

First and foremost, the monad creates a shield of materiality from five-dimensional spaces, then an astral body from the materiality of four-dimensional spaces.

Both of these cloudings are often merged in our understanding under the word "soul." The shell is the material receptacle of the Monad with all its divine properties and its nearest instrument. Not the Monad itself, remaining in the five-dimensional Irhólene, but the shell itself is the "I" that begins its journey through the lower layers. The shell is created by the Monad itself, while in the creation of the astral body, the great element, Mother Earth, takes part. She participates in the creation of the astral bodies of all beings of Shadanakar - humans, angels, demons, animals, elementals, demons, and even the great hierarchies when they descend into the layers where the astral body is necessary. This body is the highest tool of the shell. It concentrates the abilities of spiritual sight, hearing, smell, deep memory, ability to fly, ability to communicate with synclites, demons, elementals, angels, the ability to sense cosmic panoramas and perspectives.

Next, Mother Earth, impregnated by the Spirit of the Sun, creates for the incarnating Monad an etheric body without which no life is possible in the worlds of three and four dimensions. And when the shell with all its clouds, including the etheric, leaves in Enrof the most external, short-lived, last of its vessels - the physical body, only the corpse remains in Enrof. The physical body is created for us by the angelic hierarchies - they create the matter itself - and by the great elemental of humanity - Lilith - who shapes the chain of the race out of this three-dimensional materiality. The impact of the Monad itself in this act through the shell lies in the fact that it gives individuality to this link in the race.

Thus the process of descent ends; the process of ascent begins. The physical body can be taken by the Monad once or, again and again, many times. The etheric, however, is created anew only if the carrier, falling under the law of retribution, was forced to make a path through the circles of great sufferings. And in the ascending path, the etheric body accompanies the carrier through all the worlds of Enlightenment up to the Zatomi - the abodes of the enlightened humanity, the heavenly cities of metaculture. It consists of vital substance, not universal, but different in all three-dimensional and four-dimensional worlds. Remembering the most ancient revelation of humanity, it would be fair to call it arungvílta-prana.

The astral body accompanies the carrier up to a certain point, including the Sakuala of High Duty, and only the enlightened Shellt remains above, fully merged with the Monad into unity. Then the Monad leaves Irulan and, clothed in an extremely subtle Shell, ascends the stairs to the highest worlds of Shadanakar.

In the subsequent parts of the book, we will discuss all of these layers, and many of them will be described as much as possible. But in more detail I am unfortunately unable to shed light on the questions about the interaction of different layers of the monad, their functions, and their structure.

#### Metacultures

The structure of Shadanakar, which we will soon have to address in its colossal complexity, will remain incomprehensible at its core if we do not first understand what a superethnic group, metaculture, and transmyth are.
The term "superethnic group" refers to a collection of nations united by a common, jointly created culture, or a separate nation whose culture was created by them alone and has achieved a high degree of individuality and brilliance.

It is understood that there are no completely isolated cultures, as they are interconnected, but overall, each culture is quite distinctive, and despite the influence it exerts on others, it remains the achievement of only one superethnic group, its creator.

The concept of a super-people could have been left out of the current concept if it did not have, in addition to historical significance, also a meta-historical significance. And its meta-historical significance lies in the fact that the uniqueness of the super-people is not limited to the cultural sphere in Enrof, but is also evident in many other immaterial layers of both ascending and descending orders, since some sections of these layers are affected only by one particular super-people. It should not be forgotten that a super-people refers not only to the individuals who currently belong to it, not only to our contemporaries, but also to many of those who belonged to it before, even at the dawn of its history, and later, in their post-death state, acted and continue to act in the transphysical layers associated with this super-people. A ladder of layers rises above humanity, common to all super-peoples, but above each of them these layers change their color, their physiognomy, their content; there are even layers that exist only above one super-people. The same is true of the demonic worlds of the descending order, which exist as if under super-peoples. Thus, a significant part of Shadanakar consists of separate multilayered segments; the Enrof layer in each of these segments is occupied only by one super-people and its culture. These multilayered segments of Shadanakar are called metacultures.

Each super-people has its own myth. This myth is created not only in the childhood period of its history, but throughout its existence. As the traditional use of the word "myth" does not coincide with the meaning that is invested in it here, it is necessary to carefully explain what concept I am investing in this word. When we speak of a strictly coordinated system of ideologically saturated images embodying some comprehensive international doctrine and finding its expression in traditions and cults, theosophemes and philosophemes, literary monuments and in the visual arts, and finally in the code of morality, we are talking about the myths of the great international religions. There are four such myths: Hindu, Buddhist, Christian, and Islamic.

When we talk about a strictly coordinated system of ideologically saturated images that determine the attitude towards Enrof, towards transphysical and spiritual measurements from the perspective of a particular super-people, about a system that has taken shape into a particular religion and played a significant role in the history of that super-people but almost did not spread beyond its borders, we are talking about the national religious myths of individual super-peoples. Such are the Egyptian, ancient Iranian, Jewish, ancient Germanic, Gallic, Aztec, Inca, Japanese, and some others.

When we mean a world of images that are just as ideologically saturated and possibly related, although not so closely, to the ideas of religious and moral order but have not developed into a coherent system and reflect a series of common moral, transphysical, meta-historical, or universal truths in connection with the givenness and obligation of this culture, we have before us the general myths of super-peoples. These include the myths of the southwestern Roman Catholic super-people, the northwestern German Protestant super-people, and the Russian super-people(^1).

____________
(^1): In some cultures, such as in Greco-Roman or Babylonian-Assyrian-Canaanite, the development of myths has already moved beyond the "general" stage, but has not yet formed a system strict enough for us to classify the Olympic and Babylonian myths as part of the group of national-religious myths of super-ethnic groups.

Finally, the last, fourth group is the general national myths, which are the myths of individual nationalities that are part of the super-people but create their own particular, very local variant in addition to the general super-national myth, which does not shine through any strict system or religion. Examples could include pagan myths of Slavic tribes, Finnish tribes, Turkic tribes, as well as myths of some isolated and backward tribes of India. In essence, myths of nationalities are found in many ethnic formations in their embryonic state, but they rarely acquire a strongly defined physiognomy.

We will not apply the word "myth" to any other phenomena in the history of culture. Thus, the last three groups of myths are specific to individual cultures. The first group, however - the myths of international religions - is mystically connected (with the exception of one) to the layers of Shadanakar that are already above its segmental divisions, called metacultures.

It seems to me that the concept of national-religious myths is easily understood. As for the common myths of super-peoples, for clarity, a couple of additional definitions should be given.

The inductive definition is as follows: the common myth of a super-people is the sum of its representations of the transphysical cosmos, of the participation in it of a given culture and of each individual who enters this culture of I(^1) - representations that are developed by this culture, taking the form of a cycle of religious-philosophical ideas, a cycle of artistic images, a cycle of socio-ethical concepts, a cycle of state-political attitudes, and finally, a cycle of common national norms that are realized in ritual, in everyday life, and in custom.

____________
(^1): At the same time, the very concept of "given culture" may not be understood more clearly than it was, for example, by the Greco-Romans, with their opposition of themselves to the rest of humanity as barbarians.

The deductive definition is as follows: the common myth of a super-people is the realization by the super-people, through its most creative representatives, of some second reality, overhanging it, into which it enters as part of its being and in which the guidance of its formation and the roots of its destiny are hidden - a realization that is clouded by extraneous admixtures arising from unordered human nature. This second reality, which serves as an object of transphysical and meta-historical, artistic and philosophical comprehension, can be conventionally denoted by the term "transmyth."

Naturally, the degree of difference between a myth and a transmyth can be quite varied. The limitations of those who perceived transmyths through intuition, dreams, artistic inspiration, religious contemplation, meta-historical enlightenment; the national, epochal, class, and personal characteristics of these consciousnesses and the subconscious realm of their beings that actively participate in this process; the impossibility of finding exact analogies in words or three-dimensional art images to express the reality of immeasurable worlds - can all lead to countless aberrations, to cluttering the myth with a mass of random, inaccurate, anthropomorphic, primitive, even simply unsuccessful elements. But myth is dynamic, it moves in time, develops, changes faces, and its later phases, as a rule, are closer to the transmyth, because over the centuries, the perceiving consciousnesses themselves have become more refined, richer, more perceptive, and broader.

But at the same time, the transmyth itself is evolving. The transcendental reality is full of turbulent motion, there can be no talk of statics. Just as the fortified cities of the Merovingian era differ from modern-day Paris, so do the landscapes, structures, and all the content of transmyths differ in the era of their emergence and at the end of their meta-historical development.

But at all stages of the development of the supra-national transmyth, alongside the Enrofan people who comprehend it, there are two other realities, two other layers, two poles of the metacultural sphere. Other layers surround and exist between them, but each of them emerged later or underwent radical changes; some disappeared. Only three domains are immutable and long-lasting: in Enrof, the supra-national realm; in the hyperdimensional space above it, the abode of its enlightened souls, the sacred cities, the celestial realm of metaculture; and at the bottom, in the descending worlds, the antipole of this celestial realm, the citadel built in the worlds connected with the deep strata of the planet's physical body. This is the focal point of the demonic forces of this metaculture. The celestial realms and everything within them are called "zatomises", while the underground citadels are called "shrastars". Typically, these two poles are more brightly and clearly reflected in myths, particularly the zatomises. The images of shrastars are not always in a finished form. The zatomises, however, the abodes of the synclites of metacultures, can be found in the myths of all supra-national peoples, both religious and secular. Such is the Eanna of the Babylonians: the ziggurat in the city of Erech was, according to the Sumerians and Akkadians, a likeness of the mountain of the gods, the celestial Eanna, and later a similar meaning was discerned by the Babylonians in the main cult building of their great city - the seven-tiered temple of Esagila. Such is the Olympus of the Greeks and Romans. Such is the Sumeru (Meru) of the Indians - the Indian Olympus, on the slopes of which shine the celestial cities of the gods of Hinduism. Such are the images of Heaven - Eden in the metacultures of Byzantine and Roman Catholicism, Jannat in Arab-Muslim culture, Shang-Chi in Chinese culture, Monsalvat in Northwest culture, and Kitezh in Russian metaculture.

Through the swirling clouds of art, beliefs, mythologies, and social structures, as we try to discern the heavenly realm of the Northwest metaculture, we must not forget for a moment that super-peoples, as long as they exist in Enrof, never complete the creation of their myths. Forms of expression change: new human groups emerge as expressers onto the historical stage; from anonymous folklore creators and ritualists, the task of mythmaking passes to thinkers and artists, whose names are lifted by waves of popular love, but the myth lives on. It lives on, deepening, filling with new content, revealing new meanings in old symbols, and introducing new symbols - in accordance with a higher stage of the general cultural development of the perceivers - firstly, and in accordance with the living meta-historical development of the trans-myth - secondly.

The heavenly realm of the Northwest culture appears to us in the image of Monsalvat, an eternally radiant mountain peak, where righteous knights from century to century guard in a cup the blood of the Incarnate Logos, collected by Joseph of Arimathea at the crucifixion and handed over to the wanderer Titurel, the founder of Monsalvat. At a distance from Monsalvat stands the ghostly castle created by the sorcerer Klingsor: the focal point of the apostate forces that relentlessly seek to crush the power of the Brotherhood - the keepers of the highest sanctuary and mystery. These are the two poles of the general myth of the Northwest super-people, from nameless creators of ancient Celtic legends, through Wolfram von Eschenbach to Richard Wagner. The assumption that the revelation of this image is complete in Wagner's Parsifal is by no means indisputable, but perhaps premature. The trans-myth of Monsalvat is growing, becoming increasingly grandiose. Let us hope that thinkers and poets will still emerge from the depths of the Northwest peoples, to whom meta-historical illumination will allow them to comprehend and depict the heavenly realm of Monsalvat as it is today.

It is easy to understand that the majority of even the largest human forms of the Northwest myth are not directly related and cannot be directly related to the image of Monsalvat. To expect an inevitable direct connection would mean to reveal a narrow and formal approach and even a complete misunderstanding of what a common super-national, rather than religious-national myth is.

In the end, any human image created by a great writer, artist, composer, who lives in the consciousness and subconsciousness of millions and becomes the inner property of anyone who creatively perceives that image, is a mythical image. Kriemhild and Ophelia, Macbeth and Brandt, Esther of Rembrandt and Margarita of Goethe, Egmont and Mr. Pickwick, Jean Christoph and Jolyon Forsyte are all equally mythical, just like Lohengrin and Parsifal. But what is the connection between artistic images, as well as philosophical and social ideas of Northwestern culture, and the poles of the Northwestern myth - Montsalvat and the castle of Klingsor?

The poles of any super-ethnic myth are surrounded by a multitude of circles, whole worlds of images, the connection of which with the center does not depend on their plot, but on internal affinity, on the possibility for us to think these images and understand them through meta-historical contemplation in the center of the myth or next to it.

Faust, of course, is not Merlin: Byron's Cain is not Klingsor: Peer Gynt is not Amfortas, and to compare Hauptmann's Emmanuel Quint to Parsifal at first seems strange. The image of Kundry, so significant in the center of the myth, probably has no equivalent parallel on its periphery. On the other hand, we will not find any prototypes of Hamlet and Lear, Margarita or Solveig in the center of the Northwestern myth. But their gaze is directed there; a reddish reflection can be seen on their clothes - either of the Grail or of the magical fires of Klingsor. These colossal figures, rising at different levels of artistic realism, at different stages of mystical enlightenment, resemble sculptures guarding the ascent along the steps of the ladder to the sanctuary where the highest secret of the Northwestern peoples resides - the sanctuary that sends spiritual waves of Providence and favor to countries covered by thickening darkness.

Do we only see reflections of the radiance from this holy shrine or from the radiance of another pole of the same myth, the devilish castle of Klingsor, only in legends about the Knights of the Round Table or only in the mysteries of Bayreuth? If Monsalvat ceases to be a simple poetic image for us, one among others, and becomes endowed with its true significance, the significance of the highest reality, we will see its reflection in Gothic abbeys and Baroque ensembles, in the paintings of Ruysdael and Dürer, in the landscapes of the Rhine and the Danube, of Bohemia and Brittany, in the rose windows behind church altars, and in the austere cult of Lutheranism. This reflection will become clear to us even in the godless, soulless palace parks of the Sun King, and in the outlines of cities rising from the ocean like entire Pamirs of skyscrapers. We will see it in the poetry of the romantics and in the works of great playwrights, in Freemasonry and Jacobinism, in the systems of Fichte and Hegel, even in the doctrines of Saint-Simon and Fourier. A special work would be required to indicate that the power of modern science, the miracles of technology, as well as the ideas of socialism, even communism, on the one hand, and Nazism on the other, are encompassed by the sphere of the myth of Monsalvat and the castle of Klingsor. Nothing, no scientific discoveries of our day, including mastery of atomic energy, takes Northwestern humanity beyond the limits outlined by the prophetic symbolism of this myth. It is believed that whoever reads this book will understand these as yet undiscovered interconnections. - Chapter 3. The Original Concept. I spoke of one of the metacultures with its myth and transmyth only to help understand the idea of the heavenly lands of humanity residing in the enlightened layers on the peaks of metacultures and to reflect on their antipodes - the strongholds of apostate principles actively creating their anti-cosmos and struggling against the forces of Light in all supra-nationalities of Enrof, in all layers, in all metacultural zones.

But the ladder of Shadanakar's layers does not end where the segments of metacultures end: beyond, there are five-dimensional and six-dimensional worlds, which also received their vague reflection in the myths and religions of humanity. In this sense, the name "transmyth" is also applicable to many of these layers. But in a narrower and higher sense, the word "transmyth" applies to a special Sakuala: a system of worlds with five dimensions of space and a huge number of temporal coordinates; these are five grand, as if glowing from within with solar radiance, beautiful and transparent pyramids, immovably towering above Enrof. Not only Enrof, but also the celestial realms of metacultures seem deeply below from there, in the darkness. These worlds are the highest aspects of three (not four!) great international religions and two religions that have almost not broken their national isolation due to a number of historical reasons, but carrying both the reflection of their own depths and this incomparably higher Sakuala. About this Sakuala, more will be said in one of the following parts.

I want to make a preliminary remark on this matter. I think that many who read this book have a sense of incomprehension: why are all the new words and names that denote the countries of the transphysical world and the layers of Shadanakar, even the names of almost all hierarchies, non-Russian? And this is because Russian metaculture is one of the youngest: when its Synclite began to emerge, everything was already named by others. Often, in these words, one can hear sounds reminiscent of Sanskrit, Latin, Greek, Hebrew, and Arabic languages, and sometimes even more ancient languages that no philologist knows yet. Naturally, I do not know them either; only by these individual words, I judge their strange phonetic physiognomy.

Now, it seems to me, everything has been said that would make the subsequent parts of the book somewhat understandable. Before us are four parts, almost entirely dedicated to describing the structure of Shadanakar - a kind of transphysical geography. Only by forming an understanding of the arena and the participants of the meta-historical mystery, even if only an approximate one, can we move on to the parts that are dedicated to the meta-historical processes themselves, especially the meta-history of Russia and its culture, and also the meta-history of modern times. This is related to the tasks and specific program of the Rose of the World, to the presentation of the historical paths on which it is possible to achieve bloodless unification of humanity into a single organism, universal abundance, the upbringing of generations of refined character, the transformation of the planet into a garden, and the transformation of a world government into a brotherhood. From here, a bridge will be thrown to the last chapters: to some distant historical predictions, to the problem of concluding cataclysms of world history, and to the inevitable, though catastrophic, transition of Enrof to another higher materiality, to another layer of being. The last pages are dedicated to cosmic perspectives that are revealed during this process.

## Book III. The Structure of Shadanakar. The Worlds of the Ascending Series.

### Chapter 1. Sakuala of Enlightenment.

I don't know where or when I will die this time, but I know where and when I died for the last time before being born in 1906 for a life in Russia. Of course, this knowledge is of no general significance and may only interest those who are able to trust my testimony and feel a karmic connection with my destiny. But my knowledge of some of the stages of the path between my penultimate existence and the current one, in terms of its objective interest, is broader, and I can and should tell about the most significant of what I have gradually remembered.

However, it is better to say not "I have managed to remember," but "I have been helped to remember." I have occasionally met people who possessed such openness of deep memory, but none of them dared to talk about it with almost anyone, and nobody even had a vague idea of ​​trying to record these memories in writing. The reason for this was the belief that such confessions could only cause ridicule and natural emotional modesty, which resists exposing to the judgment of strangers what is intimate, inviolable, and at the same time unprovable.

For a very long time, I looked at the matter in the same way, and even now I undertake this attempt without the slightest pleasure. But since decisively everything that I describe in this book has an equally unproven source, I no longer see any reason to remain silent specifically about breakthroughs of deep memory. I either should not have started the book at all, or since I have started, I should talk about everything, despite my fears. Moreover, my hope is strengthened that readers who do not trust me have already been weeded out after the first few chapters, and only people predisposed to benevolence will continue to follow my narrative.

My last death occurred about three hundred years ago in a country that leads another very ancient and powerful metaculture. Throughout my current life, from childhood on, I have been tormented by nostalgia for this old homeland; perhaps it burns so deeply because I lived not one, but two very intense lives in that country. However, when I left Enroth three hundred years ago, for the first time in my entire journey through Shadankar, I was free from the necessity of atoning for posthumous descents into the depths of the layers where the suffering untangle karmic knots they tied in life, sometimes for centuries, even millennia. For the first time, I managed to untie the knots in Enroth, paying for my youthful mistakes and failures with long-lasting torment and bitter losses. And for the first time, I died with a light soul, although according to the religious beliefs of that country, I should have expected a truly terrible afterlife. But I already knew that I had redeemed myself from the caste exclusion and forty years of life among the pariahs. Death was easy and full of hope.

It was a tangible hope that does not deceive. I still cannot remember the first few hours or even days of my new existence. But I do remember a few locations of that new layer in which I existed for a long time afterward.

This layer, shared by all metacultures, was very diverse, though. In the ancient, tropical, huge metaculture that embraced my earthly life twice, it was similar to the nature of Enroth but softer, without the extremes of its cruelty and magnificence, without the violent tropical rains and the destructive dryness of deserts. I remember how white tower-like clouds of extraordinary strength and grandeur stood almost motionless above the horizon, rising to the middle of the sky: nights and days changed, and the giant radiant towers remained almost the same. But the sky itself was not blue or turquoise but deep green. And the sun was more beautiful there than with us: it played with different colors, slowly and smoothly changing them, and I cannot explain why the color of the source of light did not determine the colors of what it illuminated: the landscape remained almost the same, dominated by green, white, and golden colors.

There were rivers and lakes; there was an ocean, although I never got to see it: once or twice I was only on the sea coast. There were mountains, forests, and open spaces, reminiscent of a steppe. But the vegetation in these zones was almost transparent and as light as the forests in the northern countries of Enroth in late spring when they are just starting to dress in a leafy covering. The ridges of the mountains and even the soil seemed just as light and semi-transparent: as if all of this was the ethereal substance of those elements whose physical substance we know so well in Enroth.

However, this layer was unknown to birds, fish, or animals: only humans remained its inhabitants. And by humans, I mean not the kind that we are in Enroth, but the kind that death makes us in the first of the worlds of Enlightenment. Finally, I could see for myself that the solace we draw from old religions with thoughts of reunions with loved ones is not a legend or deception, provided that what we have done in life has not carried us into the sorrowful layers of atonement. Some of my loved ones met me, and the joy of being with them became the content of whole periods of my life in that layer.

It is very ancient, once inhabited by angelic proto-humans, and it is called Olyrn: this musical word seems to me a fortunate discovery by those who gave it its name. Communication with loved ones contained no murkiness, bitterness, petty concerns, or misunderstanding that mar it here: it was ideal communication, partly through speech, but more often in silence, which here is only familiar in communication with a few with whom we are connected by particularly deep love, and in particularly deep moments.

We were completely liberated from the need for existence that had such immense importance in Enroth. The need for housing was eliminated by the mildness of the climate. It seems that in Olyrn and some other metacultures this is not entirely the case, but I don't remember the details exactly. Delicious vegetation provided food, and springs and streams served as drinks, with different tastes as far as I can remember. Clothing, or rather, that beautiful, living, misty, glowing substance that we try to replace with wool, silk, or linen products in Enroth, was produced by our own bodies: by that ethereal body of ours that we hardly ever recognize on ourselves here, but which becomes just as obvious and just as important for us in the afterlife as the physical body is. And in the worlds of Enlightenment, as well as in Enroth, life without it is impossible.

And yet the first period in Olyrne was poisoned by the sadness of those left behind in Enrof. Children and grandchildren, friends and my old wife, the most precious creature to me, for whom I broke the caste law and became untouchable, remained there. Cutting off contact with them nourished a constant anxiety about their fate. Soon, I learned to see their vague shapes wandering along Enrof's thorny paths. And after a while, I would meet my wife again, just as young as she used to be but even more beautiful. Her journey in Enrof would end a few years after mine, and now the joy of our reunion was not tainted by anything.

New perception organs opened up one after the other: not the vision and hearing organs that fully coincide with the corresponding organs of the physical body in the etheric body - no! These vision and hearing organs were functioning from the first minutes of my stay in Olyrne, and it was through them that I perceived Olyrne. But what we call spiritual vision, spiritual hearing, and deep memory; what the greatest sages in Enrof strive to unfold; what is only revealed there by the few among the many millions; what unfolds gradually for everyone in Olyrne. Spiritual vision and hearing overcome obstacles between many layers. I perceived the lives of those left behind on Earth precisely through them - still indistinctly, but I perceived.

I enjoyed the enlightened nature - such visual beauty I had never seen in Enrof - but it was strange: there was something lacking in this nature, and soon I realized what it was: the diversity of life. I sadly remembered the singing and chirping of birds, the buzzing of insects, the flicker of fish, the beautiful forms, and the unconscious wisdom of higher animals. Only here did it become clear to me how much the animal world means to us, to our communication with nature. However, those who knew more than me gave hope that the ancient, vague dream of humanity about the existence of layers where animals appear enlightened and highly intelligent - not a dream, but a presentiment of truth: such layers exist, and over time, I will enter them.

Later, quite recently, I was reminded of certain zones that exist in the Olirns of all metacultures. They spoke of areas resembling hilly steppes, where those who were too closed in on themselves in Enrof, whose karmic knots were untied but whose souls were too narrow and constricted, would stay for a while. Now, among the transparent, quiet hills, under the magnificent sky, nothing prevents them from repairing this damage by taking in the rays and voices of the cosmos and expanding the boundaries of their expanding selves. They also spoke of zones in Olirna resembling mountainous countries, where those who were able to believe - or rather, to feel the afterlife with certainty - worked on themselves only in the afterlife. From there, they contemplated the mountain peaks, not as we see them, but in spiritual glory. The powerful spirits that rule there pour streams of their strength into those who contemplate them. And the abilities of the soul, paralyzed by disbelief, are revealed there, in the days and years of direct contemplation of the multi-layeredness of the universe and the solemn greatness of other worlds. But I don't remember how clearly, perhaps because I was only a guest there, and the source of this information does not inspire me with absolute confidence that the information is not simplified for my understanding, and therefore not distorted.

In addition to communicating with people and enjoying nature, time was spent working on my body: I had to prepare it for transformation, because the path from Olirna to the higher worlds does not lie through death, but through transformation. And I understood that the verses of the Gospel, which tell of the ascension of Jesus Christ, hint at something similar. The resurrection from the dead changed the nature of His physical body, and during the ascension from Olirna, it was transformed again together with the etheric. For me, like everyone else, only the etheric body was to be transformed; a transformation similar to what the apostles once saw with their sight, penetrating Olirna, but not yet reaching the worlds above. How else could the evangelists express the Savior's transition from Olirna there, except by calling it His ascension to heaven? And I, brought up in strict Brahmanism, began to understand how strange the Christian myth, full of bottomless truth, was for me.

And the image of the great traitor, which I had previously only regarded as a legend, became a reality for me: I learned that he is now here, amidst the seas of Olyrnia, in deep seclusion, on a deserted island. His path through suffering lasted more than sixteen centuries. Burdened by the weight of a karma that was incomparable in its heaviness, in the deepest of them all, which had never before or since seen a single human being, he was lifted from there by the One Who had been betrayed on earth, but only after the Betrayed One had achieved such incredible spiritual power in his post-death state, which was necessary for this and which no one had previously attained in Shadanakar. Raised by the forces of Light up and up through the steps of purgatory, having atoned for his betrayal, he finally reached Olyrnia. Still not interacting with its inhabitants, he prepares on the island for further ascension. I saw this island from afar: it is harsh, with a pile of strange rocks inside, the peaks of which are all tilted in one direction. The peaks are sharp, the color of the rocks is very dark, almost black in some places. But no one sees Judas in Olyrnia: they only see the glow of his prayers over the island at night. In the future, when the kingdom of the one commonly referred to as the Antichrist comes in Enroth, Judas, having received a great mission from the Betrayed One, will be born again on earth and, having fulfilled it, will meet a martyr's end at the hand of the prince of Darkness.

But I could not explain the exact efforts that led to my own transformation or what was actually happening to my body at that moment. Now I can only recall what was before my eyes: a multitude of people, perhaps hundreds, who came to accompany me on the high path. Achieving transformation for anyone living in Olyr is always a joy for others; the event is surrounded by a solemn, bright, and happy atmosphere. Obviously, the event occurred during the day, on a raised area like a hill and, like everything in Indian Olyr, under the open sky. I remember how the rows of faces turned gradually mistier and seemed to move away from me, or rather, apparently, I myself moved away from them, rising above the ground. In the distance, on the horizon, I saw a semi-transparent mountain range, as if made of chrysolite, which suddenly began to emit amazing radiance. Shimmering rainbows crossed each other across the sky, and wonderful celestial bodies of different colors appeared in the zenith, and the magnificent sun could not eclipse them. I remember the feeling of overwhelming beauty, incomparable joy, and amazement. When my gaze dropped, I saw that the crowds that had accompanied me were no longer there, and the entire landscape had been completely transformed, and I understood that the moment of my transition to a higher level had already passed.

I had been warned that I would not stay in this layer for very long, because everyone who passes through it does so in a few hours, but during these hours, the entire layer, called Fayr, would be filled with rejoicing for me, who had achieved it. This is a great holiday, destined for every ascending soul, not only human, but also for the souls of other monads of Shadanakar, ascending through the stages of Enlightenment, even the higher animals. In a sense, Fayr is a threshold of the path: after it, reincarnations can still occur in Enrof, but only with a specific mission.

Subsequently, falls, rebellion, and even deeply conscious and severe betrayal of God are not excluded, but blind failure is no longer possible, and the paralysis of spiritual understanding, which manifested itself in various epochs of Enrof in the psyche of those living there, changing its varieties, shades, and names, is forever excluded from the list of possibilities, especially in our era, although not exhaustively, it is determined as materialism.

If you try to find even a remote analogy to what you see in Fayr among familiar phenomena for everyone, you cannot stop at anything other than festive illumination. It goes without saying that the most magnificent of Enrof's illuminations are no more than a few of our lamps compared to the constellation Orion in comparison to Fayr.

I have seen many beings in their doubly and triply enlightened forms: they came here from higher layers, driven by the feeling of joy. The feeling of joy is inherent in the enlightened ones to an incomparably greater extent and strength than in us; every soul that has reached Fayr generates this exultant feeling in millions of those who have passed it before.

How to convey the state that engulfed me when I saw the multitudes of enlightened ones exulting because I, insignificant me, had reached this world? Not gratitude, not joyful embarrassment, not even shock—rather, it was like that blissful excitement when mortals in Enrof give in to uncontrollable and silent tears.

I do not remember the minutes and forms of transition to the next layer. The breathtaking experience of Fayr caused a deep exhaustion and as if softening of all the soul's tissues. And all I can now reconstruct from the experience of the next stage of ascent boils down to one state, but one that lasted very long, perhaps for years.

Radiant peace. Isn't that a contradictory phrase, one might think? With an abundance of light, we associate the idea of activity, not rest, of movement, not peace. But that's us, in Enrof.

It's not like that everywhere. And even the word "luchezarny" is not as precise as one would like it to be. Because the radiance of Nertisa is radiant and at the same time inexplicably soft; it combines the enchanting tenderness of our full moon nights with the shining lightness of high spring skies. As if lulled by something more tender than the quietest music, I dissolved into a happy doze, feeling like a child, after many months full of insults, sufferings, and undeserved bitterness, rocked on maternal knees. Feminine tenderness was permeating everything, even the air, but it was emanating with particular warmth from those who surrounded me, as if caring for the sick and tired with inexhaustible love. They were the ones who had risen to even higher layers before me and descended from there to Nertisa to create tenderness, love, and happiness for those like me.

Nertis is a country of great relaxation. Without any effort on my part, imperceptibly and subtly, only as a result of the efforts of my friends' hearts, my ethereal body slowly changed here, becoming lighter, imbued with spirit, and more obedient to my desires. It becomes like our body in the heavenly countries of metaculture, precisely in Nertis. And if someone close to me who remained in Enrof could see me, they would understand that it is me. They would perceive an indescribable resemblance between my new appearance and the one they knew, but they would be deeply moved by the otherworldly radiance of my transformation.

What has remained of the old me? My facial features? Yes, but now they shone with eternal, unearthly youth. My bodily organs? Yes, but two delicately blue flowers shone on my temples - these were organs of spiritual hearing. My forehead seemed adorned with a magical, sparkling gem - an organ of spiritual vision. The organ of deep memory located in the brain remained invisible. Likewise, the changes taking place in the internal organs of the body were also invisible because everything previously adapted to the tasks of nourishment and reproduction had been abolished or fundamentally changed to suit new tasks. Nourishment became similar to the act of breathing, and the replenishment of life force was achieved through the assimilation of the bright emanations of the stichials. However, reproduction, as we understand it, does not exist in any of the ascending worlds. There is something else, and I will talk about it when I get to the chapter on Heavenly Russia.

After a long time, I began to feel everything that was coming, a joyful increase in strength, as if the unfolding of mysterious and long-awaited wings. Don't understand me too literally: I'm not talking about the appearance of something resembling the wings of flying creatures of Enroth, but about the unfolding of the ability for unimpeded movement in all directions of four-dimensional space. It was still just a possibility - immobility still rested me, but the possibility of flight was turning from an undefined dream into an obvious one, opening up a perspective before me. My heart friends let me know that my stay in Nertis was coming to an end. It seemed to me that something like a cradle, where I rested, was slowly swaying up and down, and each takeoff seemed higher than the previous one. This movement created anticipation of even greater happiness, into which I must now enter. And I realized that I was already in another layer - in Gotimna, the last of the worlds of the Sakuala Enlightenment. They were like colossal flowers, the size of which did not deprive them of amazing tenderness, and between them, there were bottomless heights and the valleys of nine colors. About two of them, lying beyond our spectrum, I can only say that the impression produced by one of them is closest to that which the heavenly blue produces on us, and the impression of the other remotely resembles the impression that gold produces here.

The huge flowers of Gotimna, forming whole forests, lean and straighten, sway and rock, sounding in unimaginable rhythms, and their swaying is like the quietest music, never tiring and peaceful, like the sound of earthly forests, but full of inexhaustible meaning, warm love, and involvement in each of those who live there. With ease and calmness, unattainable for any creature in Enroth, we moved as if floating in any of the four directions of space between these singing flowers, or lingered, talking to them, because their language became understandable to us, and they understood us. Here, on the celestial blue glades or under the presentation of huge, quietly flickering golden petals, those who descend into Gotimna from the beyond visited us to prepare us, younger brothers, for the next stages of the journey.

The Garden of High Courts is called Gothimna, because it is here that the destinies of souls are predetermined for a long time. Before me appeared a crossroads: it is presented to everyone who has ascended to this level. Once chosen here, it could not be changed for many centuries in any of the many worlds preselected here. I was free to choose one of two options: either the ascent to Heavenly India, the end of the path of reincarnations forever, replaced by the path of ascending transformations through other immaterial layers; or one or even several existences in Enrof, but no longer as a result of unbound karma - it was untied - but as a means to carry out certain tasks entrusted only to me and freely accepted by me. And although the word "mission" in Russian sounds bookish and devoid of poetry, I will continue to use it to denote such special tasks assigned to individual souls to carry out in Enrof. The weight of responsibility for the one who took on the mission increases many times over, since the mission is always associated not only with the fate of its bearer, but also with the fate of many souls, both during life and after death, and sometimes with the fate of entire peoples and all of humanity. Those who voluntarily or because of weakness betray their mission will face retribution and redemption in the deepest and most terrible layers. This does not mean that those who have passed through the Garden of Enlightenment are immune to falls, betrayals, and ethical lapses on earth. Only a blind lapse based on ignorance of the existence of God is impossible; but that which slumbers at the bottom of the soul under the rays of Nertis and Gothimna can awaken in the darkness of Enrof's nights and lead the bearer of the mission astray or downward. If these falls do not affect the beings of his mission, Providential forces will lift him out of any abyss so that the mission can still be carried out. Before me opened the possibility of descending back into the boundaries of another metaculture, hitherto unknown and alien to me, still very young but with a great future. Something troubled, turbulent, and gloomy emanated from this huge, layered mass, vaguely perceived by me from afar. However, the task I had accepted had to do with the great task that went far beyond this metaculture and was obliged to encompass the world in the distant future. Already, thousands of souls were being prepared to participate in this task. And I chose this opportunity. I now understood that I had taken on such a burden that could no longer be cast off.

And from Gothimna India, I was transported to Gothimna Russia: there was where my preparation for carrying out the mission, accepted from above by my Self, was supposed to end. But falls, acts of rebellion and betrayal are possible even after bright lives, because then what has been dormant in the soul can awaken in the sunlight. There were such falls on my path already after Gothimna. However, this will have to be shed light on in some other chapters of the book. Now it's time to talk about zatomises, the heavenly lands of metaculture. But if I could speak of the sakual of Enlightenment as something experienced based on what I was able to remember, then the sakual of zatomises can only be stored in memory by rare fragmentary images, captured much later, during my transphysical travels, which took place in a state of sleep from here, from Enrof Russia. These vague images were supplemented by another invaluable source of knowledge - transphysical meetings and conversations. The autobiographical method is not applicable to presenting this material. And the following chapters will unfortunately be protocol and dry, similar to the chapter on the initial concept.

### Chapter 2. Zatomises

The peaks of metacultures, called zatomises, to some extent coincide with the geographical contours of the corresponding cultural zones of Enroth. The space of all zatomis is four-dimensional, but each of them is characterized by its own unique number of temporal coordinates. The materiality of this sakuala is created by one of the angelic hierarchies - the Dominions; the zatomis themselves are slowly constructed by the joint efforts of hierarchies, heroes, geniuses, righteous ones, and the widest masses capable of creativity, while the super-people who have advanced them continue their formation in history - and later, when their historical path is completed and millions of their immortal monads continue their ascent from one height of world knowledge and creativity to another.

The founder of each zatomis is one of the great human spirits. The panorama of these layers very remotely resembles our nature. Perhaps the elements of the earthly landscape closest to the landscape of the zatomis are the sky with clouds. Our oceans and seas correspond to zones of as if bright vapors, easily penetrable and shining: these are the souls of the sea stihials; their souls correspond to the rivers of Enroth, formations of indescribable beauty, which cannot even be hinted at in words as "shining mists." The vegetation is little like ours: these are the souls of stihials, which will be discussed later. For now, it seems to me enough to say that the souls of some stihials are located in the zatomis in the intervals between incarnations.

The change of day in these layers proceeds in exactly the same way as with us, being determined by the same rotation of the planet around its axis. The weather changes within the limits of pleasant and beautiful.

Higher humanity - synclites of metaculture - is our hope, our joy, support, and hope. Righteous ones, some lineages and heroes enter here almost immediately after death in Enrof, quickly passing through the worlds of Enlightenment. About the overwhelming majority of such souls, no history will tell us: they passed in the depths of the people, leaving no trace in chronicles or legends - only in the memory of those who knew them or heard about them from living witnesses. These are the unnoticed heroes of our life; to think otherwise, that is, to imagine the synclites of metaculture as some kind of gathering of "celebrities", would mean proving that our moral-mystical mind is still sound asleep.

Others, especially carriers of special gifts, even those who fell into the depths of purgatory after death, rise from there by the power of the Light, shortening the terms of their redemptive purification, and enter the synclite. Not only other artistic geniuses but also more lineages and heroes, and righteous ones - all of them have untied their karmic knots in Enrof, redeemed the burden of their guilt, and death was for them the wide-open gates of Zatomis.

For others, death caught them unprepared for higher stages, still burdened. Such ones have to first pass through a series of steps in the upper purgatories - upper in relation to the terrifying circles of magma and the earth's core, but lower in relation to us. Many thousands of such souls, finally reaching Gothimna, choose not new descents into Enrof but labor and great struggle in the brotherhoods of Zatomis.

The third group did not burden their souls with any falls in Enrof; on the contrary, but their horizons, the volume of their knowledge, and their sense of the cosmic, although grown after Olyrnia, are still not great enough. The path from Olyrnia meant for them the beginning of wandering, sometimes - long, even lasting centuries until they become capable of embracing the tasks and wisdom of the synclite. Thus, between the last death in Enrof and entry into the synclite, such souls do not redeem themselves but only expand and enrich themselves.

The path of reincarnation is not a universal law. However, the majority of monads still follow this path. They have already experienced a number of births in other nations of Enroth, in other meta-cultures, even in other millennia and on other ends of the earth, and before the human cycle, many of them passed through their path in other kingdoms of Shadanakar; their shells may have even towered over beings of the plant and animal kingdoms. Some knew incarnations in ancient times as titans, among primordial angels or daimons. The memory of this garland of births is stored in their deep memory; the volume of spiritual personality of such monads is particularly great, the abyss of memories is particularly deep, and their future wisdom is characterized by a special breadth. The carriers of the highest gift of artistic genius, which is dedicated to several chapters in another part of this book, all had a similar garland of incarnations behind them. And on the contrary: the righteous of the Christian meta-cultures, in contrast to the righteous of some Eastern meta-cultures, know, for the most part, another path of ascent: a path that leads to Enroth only once, but in travels through other layers, revealing before their eyes such heights of the world that the memory of it burns in their souls like a star, and its rays unravel all the darkness in their hearts during their only life in Enroth.

The activity of the Synclites is incredibly diverse and broad, and in many ways incomprehensible to us. I could point out three aspects of it: help - creativity - struggle.

Help - for everyone who has not yet reached Zatmisy. The angels of darkness, the masters of purgatory, would not release their victims for centuries and centuries if it were not for the uninterrupted efforts of the Synclites. The magmas and terrifying worlds of the earth's core would keep the sufferers until the third world period (only the first one is now coming to an end). The inhabitants of Enroth would be surrounded by an almost impenetrable armor of spiritual darkness if it were not for the Synclites.

But this work, freeing some, easing others, protecting third, enriching fourth, enlightening fifth, is only one aspect. The other side is the creation of autonomous values whose significance is enduring. However, for us, contemplation of the creations of the Synclites, let alone understanding them, is possible only to a minimal extent. The transmission of their meaning with the help of our concepts is completely excluded.

A third aspect of the activities of the Synclites is somewhat clearer - their struggle against demonic forces. One could say that they fight these forces physically, but of course, their weapons have no points of contact with Enroth's weapons. Their weaponry is diverse; it depends on their mastery of their own being and who it is directed against. However, its general principle is characterized by the concentration of volitional radiations that paralyze the enemy. Death in battle is impossible for the Synclite brothers. Another possibility is lengthy captivity in the depths of demonic fortresses in case of defeat.

The landscapes of Zatomis are complicated by some equivalent of cities, very few of which resemble our own, especially since there are no dwellings there in the strict sense of the word. The purpose of these structures is entirely special; they are primarily places of communication between the Synclite brothers and other worlds and the spirits of other hierarchies. Buildings where they engage in their highest forms of communication with the monads of stihials are called sheralthals. Nevertheless, in the architecture of Zatomis, one can discern styles that are familiar to us, but as if erected on incomparably higher levels. This is the result of parallel processes that are not easy to understand. It is difficult - but necessary - to understand.

The thing is, the beautiful architectural structures of Enroth, saturated with the radiations of many human psyches, acquire a soul, or rather an astral body, and such astral bodies reside in Zatomis. However, there are also structures in Zatomis that have no counterpart in Enroth, for example - the same sheralthals. There are also those that were grasped, understood by the creators of Enroth, and marked by them for embodiment on Earth, but history has put an insurmountable obstacle to this.

Brothers of the Synclites can descend into the worlds of the descending series all the way down to the magma, and ascend to very high levels, which are referred to as the Higher Aspects of the Transmuted Worlds of Religions. In each zatomis, the transformed language of the corresponding Enrof country prevails, which is not only a sound language, but also a light language. It is not at all strange to apply our concept of a vocabulary "fund" to these languages; it should be noted that this fund is very different from ours, accordingly having an incomparably richer stock of concepts. Along with these meta-culture languages, there is also a common language for all: the names of levels, beings, and hierarchies - from there. The speed and ease of learning different languages here cannot be compared to the corresponding process in Enrof: it happens effortlessly, naturally. The common language of the zatomis is commonly referred to as the language of the Synclite World, but this is not entirely accurate: the Synclite World, which is far ahead, knows such forms of communication that have nothing to do with any sound languages. However, descending from the heights into the zatomis of meta-cultures, the brothers of the Synclite World directed the creation of a unified language for the zatomis, and it is only for this reason that the conditional name of this language is associated with their name. In addition to the Synclites, other beings also inhabit the zatomis: the future angels. These are the most wonderful creations of God, and if we remember our legends of sirens and alkonosts, we will come closer to the idea of those whose presence adorns life in the zatomis of Byzantium and Russia: the idea of beings predetermined to become "solar archangels". In other zatomis, other beings also dwell, no less beautiful. So, I have come to a list of the zatomis. There are nineteen of them. Maif is the oldest of the zatomis, a heavenly country and a Synclite of the Atlantic meta-culture, which existed in Enrof approximately from the twelfth to the ninth millennium BC.

Atlantis was located on an archipelago of islands, the largest and most important of which in terms of size resembled Sicily. It was inhabited by a red race. It was a slaveholding society, initially consisting of several small states, later united into a despotism. Their worldview was polytheistic with a large layer of magic. The pantheon and cult were overshadowed by demonolatry. Of the cultures we know well, Atlantis would be closest to Egypt and partly to the Aztecs, but darker and heavier. Architecture, sculpture, and dance dominated the arts. The civilization cannot be called high, although the Atlanteans, using the presence of a chain of small islands between Atlantis and America, maintained a connection with this continent, from where they originated. Later they managed to reach West Africa, and the legend of Atlantis eventually reached Egypt through the ancient Sudanese civilization, which is now unknown, but traces of which can still be found in the future. The ethical beliefs of the Atlanteans were dominated by the images of merciless and greedy deities, and in the cult, ritual cannibalism played a significant role. In the late period, semi-esoteric religious movements of a bright nature emerged. But in general, the picture was quite bleak due to the great activity of demonic elements.

The main island and its surrounding smaller ones perished from a series of seismic catastrophes. Small groups of residents were saved in America, one in Africa, where they dissolved into the Negro population of Sudan. Now, Maif, existing for about fifteen thousand years over a certain zone of the Atlantic Ocean, has reached enormous power of Light.

Linat - the zatomis of the so-called Gondwana, if one understands by this name not that ancient continent that existed in the Indian Ocean long before humans, but a metaculture with centers in Java, Sumatra, Southern Indostan, and some cities that now lie at the bottom of the sea. The time of the existence of the Gondwanan culture was six or more thousand years before Christ.

This was a group of states - trading oligarchies based on slave ownership, and the highly developed navigation of Gondwana drew the coastal regions of the Indochinese Peninsula, Ceylon, and many islands of Indonesia into commercial and cultural exchange. Polytheism and, primarily, the same three arts prevailed; dance evolved into mystery theater. However, the bloodthirstiness and religious-demonic cruelty of the Atlanteans of Gondwana were unfamiliar. It was a sensual, sanguine, life-greedy people, richly endowed artistically, with a highly tense sexual sphere of life. The mystique of gender permeated both the cult and everyday life, reaching its peak of true splendor in the era of prosperity; neither Atlantis nor even Babylon and Egypt knew such luxury. The Gondwana race can, I think, be called proto-Malay. In any case, their brown skin tightly covered their broad cheekbones and full lips, their elongated eyes were slightly slanted, their figures were slender and muscular, with broad shoulders, a thin waist, and very strong calf muscles. The people were beautiful with the passionate beauty of the south.
Thousands of years later, in the same zone, the Indo-Malaysian culture emerged, repeating some of its predecessors, but much more spiritualized.

The emblematic image of Linat:
A woman in purple and a man in green, embracing each other by the shoulders, on a golden background, under the red lower half of the sun disk.

The purple color here signifies the merging of blue - the power of the world's femininity, which was first lowered with such force in the Gondwanan metaculture during the entire existence of humanity - with red, which symbolizes elementality, but not in the sense of the natural elements, but in the sense of extraordinary activity of some elemental beings connected with humanity. Green denotes the same power of activity of natural elemental beings. Gold is the hieratic background indicating a developed spiritual reality standing behind this superethnic group.

Ialu (whose name seems to be Athyam as well) is from the Ancient Egyptian metaculture. This culture, which completely overshadowed Atlantis with its scale and grandeur, created a huge synod and dazzling Ialu during its historical existence. However, the demonic forces managed to achieve a serious victory in the fourteenth century BC, when Providential forces made the first step towards enlightening the consciousness of the people by the reality of the One God through the great prophet and reformer Akhenaten. If Akhenaten's reform had succeeded and found worthy successors and continuers, the mission of Christ would have been accomplished several centuries earlier, not on the Jordan, but in the Nile Valley.

I would like to note that the Egyptian belief in the Heavenly Nile had a basis in the experience of the highest reality. The magnificent river flowing through Ialu - the mythical land of the Blessed, that is, through the Ialu of the metaculture - is multilayered: it is both the great spiritualized elemental of the earthly Nile and the Cathedral Ideal Soul of the Egyptian people.

Eanna is a zatomis of the ancient Babylonian-Assyrian-Canaanite metaculture, which apparently arose in the fourth millennium BCE. The seven-tiered temple observatories, which became the peaks and centers of the great cities of Mesopotamia, repeated in Enrof as reflections, the grand celestial city constructed by the synclite of this zatomis. However, the ziggurats in the cities of Babylon and the corporation of the high priestly hierarchy, while receiving the radiations of bright cosmic forces at these mystical observatories, were not protected from also accepting extremely active radiations from the galactic anti-Cosmos, the center of which coincides with the system of the star Antares in Enrof. This increasingly clouded the already ambiguous religion, infused a subtle poison into the nature of those who received it, and burdened their emotional composition with a weight of doubt and denial.

The Babylonian metaculture was the first in which Gagtunguru succeeded in achieving the embodiment of the powerful demonic creature, Wuicraor, in the underground four-dimensional layer adjacent to the Babylonian Shrastra, whose descendants played and continue to play a tremendous and extremely destructive role in the meta-history of humanity. To a significant extent, it was Wuicraor who was responsible for the overall spiritual damage that was observed in this culture in Enrof. And although the goddess of the underworld, Ereshkigal, was eventually overcome by the bright Astarte, who descended into the transphysical torments of Babylon in a burst of sacrificial love, pessimistic, almost nihilistic despair prevailed over the ideas of the afterlife of human souls, except for kings and priests: an intuitive understanding of the paralyzing power of demonic forces.

Shang-Chi is a zatomis of Chinese metaculture that has existed in Enroth from the second millennium BCE to the present day. Its significant growth began in the centuries before Christ when Confucianism created a long-lasting moral code and way of life that contributed to the improvement of the nation's ethical level. However, there was a low ceiling for the free development of the higher aspects of the soul. Gradually, the Confucian law became not only a means of ascent but also a hindrance, leading to the fact that the volume and strength of the Chinese metaculture, despite its antiquity, are not as great as one might expect. The spread of Buddhism spread a different metaculture across geographic China, coexisting with Shan-Ti and absorbing many more enlightened souls than the national Chinese metaculture did in recent centuries.

Sumera (or Meru) - I do not know which of these names is more correct.

The metaculture of the Indian metaculture is the most powerful of all the metacultures of Shadanakar. According to ancient mythology, the peak of Mount Sumera was crowned with the city of Brahma, and the slopes housed cities of other deities of Hinduism, but Heavenly India was not limited to their number and included several large areas of land divided by seas. Now, Heavenly India towers over the Enroth geographical zone, which is much wider than the boundaries of the Indian state. For four thousand years, the spiritual activity of exceptionally gifted people in religious terms in India has led to the fact that two metacultures separated from it, becoming independent systems of strata, and the Heavenly India itself was replenished with such a huge number of enlightened souls that in the 20th century, its syncretism outweighed the entire power of demonic elements. India turned out to be the only culture of Enroth, steadily developing along the path of high ethics. Even earlier, the power of the Indian syncretism prevented the creation by the forces of Gagtowngra, as they did in other metacultures, of strata of hopeless torment. Before Christ, this metaculture remained the only one with purgatories and did not reach its lower extremity to magma.

The mayor has two great centers: over the Himalayas and over the Nilgiri mountains in central India, as well as many smaller ones. In addition, the Indian synclite of Enroth has a strong point of support in the form of a certain fluid collective of people who epically move along a certain geographical curve: before the Second World War, it was located in the Pamirs, now it is in South India.

The landscape of Heavenly India is similar to that of Heavenly Russia, but the nature is more luxurious, reflecting the tropical character of Enroth's corresponding countries and the long duration of this zatomis. The Heavenly Ganges flows through the entire zatomis, and for Indian metaculture, it has the same double meaning as the Heavenly Nile for the Egyptians.

Zervan is the zatomis of ancient Iranian (Mazdean) metaculture. The insufficient clarity of the idea of monotheism in this, however, very elevated and pure religion did not allow the creation of a soil that was necessary for the mission of Christ to be carried out in Iran. The subsequent attempt of Iranian metaculture to make up for this failure by creating a new international religion - Manichaeism - ended in a secondary failure because the demonic involution gained access to the creative consciousness of its founders. By the time of the Muslim conquest, Iranian culture had exhausted its progressive movement. In the following centuries, the only point of support for it in Enroth was the Parsi community in India. Naturally, the number of those entering Zervan through the Worlds of Enlightenment now is extremely small, and Zervan itself has almost detached from the geographical zones of Enroth.

Olympus is the zatomis of ancient Greco-Roman metaculture.

This name refers to the center of Zatomis, the greatest city of the enlightened ones, truly associated with the geographic region of Mount Olympus and the entire heavenly country of Greco-Roman metaculture. In the historical era of Greece and Rome, it was the dwelling and arena of activity for those non-human hierarchies that were reflected in the images of the Greco-Roman pantheon. Over the millennia after Christ, this Zatomis gradually became the dwelling place of the synod. The hierarchies that once resided there have made a huge ascent over the centuries and now reside and act in incomparably higher worlds. At the same time, however, they oversee Olympus and actively envelop it in the synod.
Apollo is the name of the demiurge of Greco-Roman metaculture. Athena Pallada is the name of the Cathedral Ideal Soul of this super race.

Nikhord is the Zatomis of Jewish metaculture, the lower, only lower layer of the synod of Israel.

The founder of Nihord was the great human spirit Abraham. The ancient teachers of Judaism were involved with the demiurge of this super-race, but the purity of this involvement was hindered by the influence of the elemental forces associated with the "genius of the place" of Mount Sinai and then with the Jewish Uicraor. Nevertheless, the Most High should be seen as the essence of the biblical books. The monotheization was necessary for all humanity, like a soil without which Christ's task could not be fulfilled in Enroth. The introduction of the idea of monotheism into the consciousness of the people was achieved at the cost of a colossal strain on the forces that exhausted Nihord for a long time. Hence, the struggle with demonic forces is not always victorious, and the tragic nature of Jewish history. In the century that ended with the life and death of Jesus, this geographically small area was the arena of the most intense struggle between the forces of Gagtungre and the Divine forces. More on this will be said elsewhere. The resurrection of Christ was greeted in Nihord with great rejoicing: the attitude of the Jewish synod to the Planetary Logos is the same as in other zatomises - nothing else can be. But those who enter Nihord are waiting for the discovery of the truth of Christ, which they did not understand on earth - a stunning discovery that many cannot comprehend for a long time. The destruction of Jerusalem and the Jewish kingdom was reflected in Nihord by sorrow, but with an understanding of the logic of what had happened: with an aggressive but weak Jewish Uicraor, nothing else could happen after it entered into irreconcilable struggle with the demiurge of the super-race during the years of Christ's preaching on earth. After the final defeat of the Jews under Hadrian, there were no more Jewish Uicraors. But behind the Uicraor stood another, more terrible demonic hierarchy - the offspring of Gagtungre, the true opponent of the demiurge; he continued to influence Judaism even in the era of dispersion. Medieval Judaism continued to be formed under the influence of two polar influences: this demon and Nihord. Now Nihord is replenished with a very small number of new brothers who enter, however, precisely through Judaism into the worlds of Enlightenment. The restoration of the State of Israel in the 20th century has nothing to do with Nihord; the restored temple is a theatrical performance, nothing more.

No new Israeli Uitzraor has emerged, but a similar role is played by one of the beings that will be mentioned in the chapter on egregores; it is subjected to the strongest influence from the main breeding ground of demonic forces.

Geographically, Nihord is still associated with the region of Palestine.

Paradise is a conventional name for the Byzantine metaculture beyond. Like the other Christian metacultures beyond, it is one of the staircases leading from different sides to the extremely high world called Heavenly Jerusalem: it is nothing but the Highest Aspect of the Christian Transmyth; the question about it will be illuminated a little later.
Paradise is an ancient, powerful layer that exists partly over Russia. Its founder was the great human spirit who was John the Baptist in Enrofe.

The victory of Jesus Christ, although only partially realized, aroused enormous excitement in the demonic worlds. In particular, their efforts were directed to prevent the transformation of the sufferings of the Byzantine metaculture into temporary purgatories. These efforts were successful, but ultimately, the Byzantine culture in Enrofe fell victim to them. The absence of purgatories and the inevitable descent of sinners into hopeless torments of magma and the Core caused that stable feeling of horror before the slightest sin, which was characteristic of the most gifted spiritual people of Byzantium; to a significant extent, it led to the extreme asceticism.
The Slavic peoples are metahistorically located in the intermediate area between the Byzantine, Russian, Roman Catholic, and Muslim metacultures. Their synclites are in Paradise.

Eden is a symbolic name for the zatomis of the Roman Catholic metaculture, which is one of the stairs leading to the Heavenly Jerusalem. Several peoples of different ethnic origins belong to this metaculture, including Poles, Hungarians, Czechs, Irish, and Croats.

The founder of Eden is a great spiritual leader who was once an apostle Peter in Enroth. The emblematic image is the same as that of Paradise, but the predominant color is blue. Blue represents the greater permeation of Catholicism with the principles of World Femininity.

Montsalvat is the zatomis of the metaculture of European Northwest, American North, as well as Australia and some parts of Africa, the most geographically extensive and segmented of all the zatomises. The founder of Montsalvat is the great spiritual leader Titurrel, who was associated with Christ long before the Savior was incarnated in Palestine. Like Loengrin and Parsifal, he is not a legendary hero, but a real person who once existed in Enroth (although not in Palestine).

The Grail contains the etheric blood of Christ shed by Him on Golgotha. The differentiation of the layers of Eden and Montsalvat is mainly based on national and cultural differences between Romance and Germanic peoples. However, the religious or secular nature of human activity has added many corrections to the afterlife destinies of Western Europeans, especially since Montsalvat arose several centuries later than Eden.

France is in an intermediate position, and its tragedy is that it has no synclite of its own. Some of the ascending monads rose from France in their afterlife to Eden, while others rose to Montsalvat.

The Monsalvat Center, previously connected to the Alpine system, moved far to the East in the late Middle Ages and is now connected to the Pamirs (the reasons for this are very complex). But there are many other smaller metacities shining over Europe and America. Some of them tower over physically small but spiritually powerful Enroth centers like Heidelberg, Cambridge, and Weimar.

Junfleia is a subset of the Ethiopian metaculture, which existed for two thousand years in extremely unfavorable historical and geographic conditions, like an island of Christianity between two hostile oceans - Islam and primitive paganism of the Negro tribes. This metaculture was unable to realize even one-tenth of its potential. Now there is a painful meta-historical process going on - Junfleia is moving to another sakuala: the sakuala of metacultures tragically unfinished in Enroth. With an exceptionally fortunate combination of historical circumstances, this process can still be reversed.

Symbolic image:
A white round building in billowing veils. Meaning: the building is a subset, the veils are thin and delicate materialities.

Giannet is a subset of Muslim metaculture. Unlike other world religions, Islam lacks the highest aspect of transmyth, meaning that in the extremely high sakuals of the highest transmyths of world religions, there is no world specifically connected with Islam. This has led to the poverty of Muslim mythology and the lack of independence of most of its developed transphysical images and plots, primarily drawn from Judaism and Christianity. Representing in many ways a regression in relation to Christianity, Islam nevertheless gives the soul the opportunity for upward movement, promotes the influx of spiritual forces into life, and over the period of its historical existence has created a not so powerful, but still very bright subset and shining synclite.

Sukhavati is the "Western Pure Land of Amitabha Buddha," a subculture associated with Northern Buddhism, specifically Mahayana. It dominates over Tibet and Mongolia, and coexists with Shangri-La and the Japanese national subculture of Nikisaka in Japan and China. Sukhavati separated from its parent Indian subculture in the 9th century, when the centers of Buddhism definitively shifted from India to Tibet and China. It particularly flourished three to four centuries later when the brilliant Himalayan subculture began to decline prematurely and the leading role was established in the Tibetan-Chinese centers of Buddhism. Sukhavati subculture is one of the most populous and powerful. It is one of two stairs to the high world of the "Highest Aspect of Buddhist Transmifa," which is called Nirvana and which we will talk about later. Emblematic image: Dawn over lotuses. Aireng-Dalyang is a subculture of the little-known Indo-Malayan subculture in Russia. Separating from the Indian subculture around the 5th century, it covered the Brahman-Buddhist kingdoms of Java, Indochinese peninsula, and Ceylon. It was historically expressed in the empire of Sailendra, which united this territory, but was later sharply weakened by the separation of Java, which fell to Islam, and in the late 19th century by the predatory demons of Europe. Now it still thrives in Indochinese kingdoms, but a favorable historical climate could bring about its new flowering. Emblematic image: Laughing children in the garden of the temple palace. Heavenly Russia - more will be said about this subculture than others in a few lines below.

This is about the Negroid metaculture. Unfortunately, I know almost nothing about it, not even its name. What is known is that it is young and very weak.

After the collapse of Sudanese culture with its religion, which allowed for the degradation of spirituality not only among the elites but even among the masses of Negro peoples in Equatorial Africa, the Negroes lost the opportunity for ascending afterlife for a long time. It began to open up to them only a few centuries ago in connection with the fact that some tribes reached the stage where vague polytheistic systems became available to accommodate the first manifestations of spirituality. Even more so, ascending afterlife was opened to Negro peoples with the spread — unfortunately, weak — of Islam and Christianity. The meta-historical significance was also in the fact of the formation of Liberia, which created a small but firmly protected center of Christian spirituality in Equatorial Africa. The Negro zatomis is also associated with the Negro population of America. Representatives of the white race ascend to this zatomis only as a rare exception. Harriet Beecher Stowe, for example, having reached Monsalvat, withdrew from there to the Negro zatomis, where her activities had great significance for a long time, and her position was partly similar to that of a queen, partly similar to that of the head of the priesthood.

Orange color is the intersection of solar gold with the alost of those stihiaels that are associated not with the kingdoms of nature, but with humanity.

The last of the great zatomis is in a state of creation. This is Arimoya, the future zatomis of universal metaculture, associated with the emergence and dominance of the forthcoming Interreligious Rose of the World. The materiality of Arimoya, like that of other zatomis, is created by one of the angelic hierarchies — Dominions; the great human spirit, who was last incarnated on earth as Zoroaster, is leading the creation of what I will tentatively call the "great design".

Emblematic image:

A white multi-towered cathedral, with a central main tower, colonnades, and stairs, surrounded by a row of huge stringed instruments resembling golden lyres. Meaning: towers are the zatomis of humanity, the central tower is Arimoya; colonnades are the worlds of demons, angels, stihiaels, enlightened animals; lyres are all the peoples of the globe.

Heavenly Russia. Emblematic image: a multi-dome pink and white city on a high bank above a blue river channel. Like the other zatomises, Heavenly Russia, or Holy Russia, is connected to the geography of the three-dimensional layer, roughly coinciding with the outlines of our country. Some of our cities correspond to its great centers; between them are regions of enlightened beauty of nature. The largest of the centers is the Heavenly Kremlin, towering over Moscow. Its sanctuaries sparkle with unearthly gold and unearthly whiteness. And high in the clouds of the meta-Petersburg, there rises a grand white statue of a galloping rider. This is not someone's personal image, but an emblem expressing the direction of the meta-historical path. Smaller centers are scattered throughout the zatomis, including the meta-cultural peaks of other nations that, together with the Russians, form a single super-people. Here reside synclites of Ukraine, Georgia, Armenia; and now a synclite of the people of Bolarus is beginning to join this zatomis along with their heavenly cities. The total number of inhabitants of Heavenly Russia is unknown to me, but I know that about half a million enlightened beings are now in the Heavenly Kremlin. The Demiurge Yarosvet manifests himself in the sky and air of this world as if a transparent ocean of power passed from one firmament to another and filled hearts. This power is concentrated in the temples of the Demiurge, his image is outlined, his voice becomes clear, and communication arises between him and the enlightened ones - communication that gives them strength and higher wisdom. Another hierarchy, similar to the Demiurge, is also manifested - the great spirits of the national leaders of separate nations that are part of our meta-culture. Among them are those that are more ancient than the fall: the Narrow Path was denied as such. Muhammad, dying, denied the existence of the Ideal Cathedral Soul of the Russian people, and her sisters - the cathedral souls of other peoples - are still not here: captured in the blocks of statism, in the citadels of the great-power demon, Uicraora, in the underground world of Russian anti-humanity, they reach Heavenly Russia only with distant sounds, weakened reflections.

The glowing seas of aether are the souls of elementals, shining with colors that are unimaginable to us. They wash around structures that could remotely be likened to the vastness of azure and white mountains. The Russian church sings about this world when it accompanies the newly deceased on their journey to the irrevocable path, so that the Lord may rest them in a "bright place, a luxurious place, a peaceful place, where there is neither sorrow nor sighing, but infinite life."

Newcomers arrive in Heavenly Russia in special sanctuaries, having the appearance of not infants, but already children. The condition of the newcomers is similar to that of childhood, but the change in age is replaced by an increase in enlightenment and spiritual power. There is no conception or birth. Receivers, not parents, prepare the necessary conditions for the enlightened soul ascending here from Gotimna. In the forms of some of the brothers of the synclite, one could guess features familiar to us from the time of their life in Enroth. Now these features are radiant, dazzling; they shine with spiritual glory, thin and light. Their clothing glows by the transformed body itself. They can move in all four directions of space without prohibition; it remotely resembles the flight of birds, but surpasses it in lightness, freedom, and speed. There are no wings. The perception of the enlightened is accessible to many layers: descending - purgatories, magma, the terrible Gasharva; ascending - the worlds of Enlightenment, the circles of angels, demons and elementals, the worlds of involutions of other Bramfatur, the worlds of the Higher Aspects of World Transmutes. They enter dark shrouds - the worlds of anti-humanity, the inhabitants of which see them but are powerless to kill them; they also enter our Enroth, but people can only perceive them with spiritual sight.

The love between a man and a woman in Enroth that is worthy of being called great continues here, freed from all burdens, grown and deepened. Some have physical intimacy, but it is completely detached from the task of continuing the race and has nothing in common with physical intimacy in Enroth. Many organs of the body have completely changed their structure, purpose, and meaning here, including organs related to the intake and absorption of food, because the process of restoring vitality here is similar to breathing. The increase in spirituality gradually leads the enlightened individual to the next great transformation of the body, which leads to higher worlds, to the Heavenly Jerusalem and even higher - up to the World Synclite and the Elite of Shadanakar.

There is nothing in Zatomi that resembles our technology; it has been replaced by something that is extremely difficult to understand. However, it can be noted that the principle is not in the creation of mechanical devices made of foreign matter, but in the development of the diverse abilities of one's own being. Only that which is somewhat comparable to our spatial arts is created here from foreign matter.

Everywhere in Zatomi, there are shining souls of the churches that existed or were supposed to be built by us. Many temples have, however, purposes that are difficult for us to understand. There are sanctuaries for communicating with angels, the Synclite of the World, demons, and supreme hierarchies. Several great temples are designed for meetings with Jesus Christ, who occasionally comes here, taking on a visible, human-like form, and others are for meetings with the Mother of God. Now, the greatest temple is being built there; it is intended to become the abode of that Great Feminine Spirit, who will take on astral and etheric flesh from the marriage of the Russian Demiurge with the Ideal Cathedral Soul of Russia. Since childhood, I have been accustomed to calling this temple the Temple of the Sun of the World, but this name is incorrect. It is properly attributed to another even more grandiose structure, the one planned to be created in Arimoy. The temple being built in the Heavenly Kremlin is called the abode of Zventy-Sventana, and later I will explain what this name means. This great Feminine Entity has now become one of the highest beings in Shadanakar. In Enrof, she will never take on flesh, but she will be born in Heavenly Russia, assuming a human-like form - not our queen or goddess, but rather light, grace, and divine beauty.

The ladder of wonderful, translucent worlds rises from the altar in the Temple of Femininity, in the temples of Christ, in the temples of the Demiurge Yarosvet. The ladder rises to the Heavenly Jerusalem and finally to the threshold of the World Savior.

At times, great human spirits are born in Heavenly Russia - those who have completed their journey in Shadanakar, reaching its highest worlds and now co-create with the Planetary Logos. For the sake of helping those below, they leave the Elite of Shadanakar and, carrying out missions that even the highest mystical human intelligence is incapable of comprehending, descend here to the lower worlds. They take on the same enlightened bodies as their synclite brothers, but surpass them immeasurably in the speed of their entry into the fullness of spiritual power and the scope of their Self. Their paths in the lower worlds resemble those of geniuses among the rest of humanity, but synclites are forewarned of their births and await them with joy and exultation.

Those who were geniuses and messengers on Earth continue their creativity here in the lower worlds after redemption, enlightenment, and transformation. The bliss of the gamayuns and sirin birds themselves grows as they witness the epic deeds that great souls, who last walked the earth in the forms of Derzhavin and Pushkin, Lermontov and Gogol, Tolstoy and Dostoevsky, Rublev and Surikov, Glinka and Mussorgsky, Kazakov and Bazhenov, create there. Glowing waves of unimaginable sounds soar in places as if from the heart of the celestial mountains: they establish the soul in a state of such spiritual bliss that an earthly heart would burst from it, and, rising and changing, like praising clouds, descend in love and the quietest joy.

The great architect, who once undertook to build the Temple of Body, Soul, and Spirit in Moscow on the Vorobyovy Hills, experiencing the collapse of his plan, exile, oblivion, and poverty, now creates the highest in the Heavenly Kremlin: the inner precincts in the abode of Zventy-Sventana.

However, among the enlightened of Heavenly Russia, only a negligible minority is known to us, familiar with the history of our homeland. The names of the others will tell nothing to our memory.

In the monasteries of Kievan and Muscovite Rus', as well as in later religious communities, lived quiet souls who, though not recognized as saints, quietly and humbly contributed to the religious creativity and spiritual work of the cathedrals. Throughout the ages, there were wanderers, seekers, storytellers, and musicians who created untold tales and spiritual songs, legends, and stories about the heroes of their time and their ideals. Skilled artisans of carvings, icons, and building magnificent wooden churches and painted houses, passionate masons, carpenters, potters, weavers, jewelers, and scribes, all worked in workshops, monasteries, and under the open sky, creating works of joy, creativity, and love for life that brought happiness to generations. Where are these creators now, and what can they create if not the eternal values of Holy Rus'?

Throughout Russian history, thousands of peasants, both serfs and freemen, lived simple and pure lives, tending to their crops and reaping their harvest with reverence and gratitude to Mother Earth, dying believing and forgiving all. In all these epochs, thousands of mothers carried their cross, raising people worthy of the name "human," and devoted their lives to this calling. Is this not one of the highest forms of creativity?

When schools began to be built, hundreds of people left their familiar circles and ways of life and descended into the depths of rural areas, among the unenlightened, where there was no one to exchange words with, all for the sake of educating the uneducated.

And what of the doctors who worked alone in whole districts? What of the hero-doctors during epidemics? What of the revolutionaries who were not driven by fanaticism, hatred, and a thirst for power, but by a living love for people and grief at the sight of the people's sorrows? And what of those priests who, given the gifts of God, lived a clear and pure life and nurtured the best of what was in the hearts of the people?

There is no way to enumerate all the paths on earth that a wanderer may take to eventually reach the synod. The question is only about time and the stages that still need to be overcome on the way to this goal. The goal is not fully manifested in a person's consciousness, but it is known by their immortal monad and draws them towards it.

Oh, it is in vain to imagine Heavenly Rus as endless, uniformly strict services and prayers. There are spiritual delights there of which we have no idea; there are jokes and laughter, and even games, especially among their children. I could name several figures of Russian culture and history who entered Heavenly Russia in the last forty years.

Let those who want to laugh at this message do so. And I am used to being considered crazy. So, here are the names of some of those who did not experience a descending after-death and immediately entered the synchlet through the worlds of Enlightenment: Leskov, Rimsky-Korsakov, Klyuchevsky, Gumilev, Voloshin, Rachmaninoff, Anna Pavlova, Sergei Bulgakov, Ioann Kronstadt, Patriarch Tikhon, Tsarevich Alexei Nikolaevich, several creators and thousands of heroes who died at the hands of Stalin. Very few of those who entered the synchlet after a short stay in the upper purgatories: Fet, L. Andreev, Alexander Blok, Shalyapin, Alexander II, Konstantin Romanov, Academician Pavlov.

From the number of the enlightened who ascended to Heavenly Russia to a special height, I know several names: Pushkin, Lermontov, Gogol, Leo Tolstoy, Alexei Konst. Tolstoy, Dostoevsky, Aksakovs, Vitberg, Kutuzov, the little-known and early deceased engraver of the XVIII century, Chemezov.

Of those who approached closest to the great transformation leading to Heavenly Jerusalem and the Synchlet of the World, the following names are of the present time: Lermontov, Vladimir Solovyov, Emperor Ioann VI, as well as two spirits whose names surprised me but were firmly pronounced twice: Shevchenko and Pavel Florensky.

Throughout the existence of Russian purgatory, several dozen people have ascended through it to the Synchlet of the World, of which I know the following names: Vladimir the Saint, Yaroslav the Wise, Anthony and Theodosius of the Caves, chronicler Nestor, warrior Sergei - author of "The Tale of Igor's Campaign," Alexander Nevsky, Sergei Radonezhsky, Andrei Rublev, Nil Sorsky, Lomonosov, Alexander the Blessed, Ambrose of Optina, Seraphim of Sarov.

Sight that breaks the shackles of our space discerns, in the distance beyond the sphere of Russian metaculture, the celestial lands of other metacultures, which are just as radiant and full of unique character.

Preparation in love and understanding for the creation of the celestial land of all humanity, the sacred Arimoya, is the bond that connects the synclites and cities of metacultures. The greatest of humanity's children, having completed their creations in their sacred cities, go beyond the metacultural boundaries. Rising to the Synclite of the World from different sides, they finally meet long before they reach it. The world of their meeting is the Gridrutva, the white palace where they create the common plan for humanity's ascent. Further ascent brings them to layers where their wisdom and power surpass those of the demiurges. The highest providential plan, which we can sometimes discern throughout history behind the demiurges' private plans, is a reflection of their creative work. This is the Synclite of the World. It is co-created, in all the clarity of spiritual consciousness, by the Planetary Logos.

Arimoya has only recently begun to be created in four-dimensional worlds, and its historical reflection on Earth will be the meaning and purpose of the coming century. For this reason, the descent of the forces of the Prisnodevi-Mother from transcosmic spheres to higher layers of Shadanakar was accomplished - forces concentrated in one divine monad. For this reason, an unprecedented temple is being built in Heavenly Russia to receive Her, whose birth in four-dimensional worlds is the goal and meaning of the forthcoming marriage of the Russian Demiurge and the Cathedral Soul. Historically, the transformation of the statehood of all peoples into the brotherhood of all will begin through the realization of this great Feminine Spirit in the Rose of the World. All synclites of metacultures help and will continue to help the Russian synclite, and the Synclite of the World will receive from them and continue their work to complete it with universal theanthropy.

However, in addition to the great zatomis counted by the number 19, there is another sakuala of zatomis in Shadanakar: these are the zatomis of metacultures tragically unfinished in Enroth. If it becomes clear that the providential forces of this metaculture cannot withstand the pressure of demonic elements, its zatomis is moved to a layer of this sakuala. Its cultural, and sometimes state formations in Enroth gradually dissolve into the common human environment, its uitsraor perish, its underground shrastries languish in painful existence, gradually degenerating; but zatomis continues its development, and synclit continues to create and strengthen its creativity. The souls of such a metaculture, not yet reaching the level at which zatomis becomes open to them, can pass stages of necessary improvement outside Enroth or undergo incarnations in other metacultures and countries, but eventually reach their own zatomis. There are also cases when the cultural-historical basis in Enroth still continues, gradually declining, its existence, and zatomis maintains an active connection and assistance to it. In such cases, it is still possible, under favorable conditions, for zatomis to return to its previous sakuala, and the super-people to historical life. Something similar is happening now with Zhunfleya, which I have already mentioned. I must briefly list the fifteen zatomis of this second sakuala.

Nambata is the zatomis of the Ancient Sudanese metaculture, which developed very slowly in extremely unfavorable conditions, or rather languished in the Niger valley, in the region of Lake Chad and in Cordofan from the ninth to the fifth millennium BC. It perished from centrifugal forces that exhausted it with endless civil wars. The first attempt in the history of mankind to cement antagonistic and ethnographically diverse nationalities with a common international religion (of course, polytheistic) failed due to the strong demonic influence through the very ambivalent pantheon of the same religion. Archaeological remains of this culture can still be found.

Cent-Tin was part of the Proto-Mongoloid meta-culture, not in an ethnographic sense, but in a territorial sense. Its people belonged to the yellow race, but anthropologically and spiritually were closer to the people of Gondwana than to later Mongolia. They inhabited Northern China and the Amur region in the 4th-3rd millennium BC and transitioned from a nomadic to a sedentary way of life. Small cities had already emerged.
The beginning of this culture was remarkable. The leading hierarchy was not a demiurge of the super-people, but a mighty demonic entity that had to turn to and was already turning towards the Light. It was destroyed by Gagtungar, and the super-people were crushed by hordes that swept in from Central Asia.

Pre-Valmiki is part of the Dravidian meta-culture, determined by this term loosely, as it included peoples of various ethnic origins, including those close to the Sumerians. Late formations of this meta-culture include the cities of Mohenjo-Daro and Harappa. The catastrophe (in the early 2nd millennium BC) was the result of both internal reasons (which are unclear to me) and external reasons: the invasion of Aryans.

Tokka is a zatomi of the ancient Peruvian (Doink) metaculture that historically developed in the centuries before and after AD. It is possible not to dwell on the fact that this culture perished in Enrofe, as the influence of demonic elements was very strong in it.(^1) Emblematic image: A stone statue of a sitting puma.

Bon is a zatomi of the ancient Tibetan culture, destroyed by Buddhism, but whose elements have organically entered into Mahayana culture. Emblematic image: Red and blue lightning crossing over an orange tent of a king. Meaning: Blue lightning - Buddhism with its spirituality, red - pre-Buddhist, heavily poisoned by demonism, Tibetan religion. The tent represents royal power, which eventually perishes as a result of the intersection of these two forces.

Gauripur is a zatomi of the small Himalayan metaculture that separated from India too early, but had immense potential. It was here that the brightest centers of Buddhism were once kindled; here, in the womb of this teaching, the meta-historical processes flowed that created a religion in the full sense of the word, that is, a doctrine that is not only moral but also trans-physical and spiritual. The moral side of Buddhism rose in the Himalayas to a level that is familiar only to the purest examples of Christianity. The Himalayan metaculture perished under pressure from demons on two sides: the Turkic uitsraors from the north and west and the uitsraors of the Great Mughal Empire from the south. Now this metaculture is completely dying out in Nepal. Emblematic image: A crowned mountain peak under the constellation of Orion.

Yunkif is a zatomi of the Mongolian metaculture, which immediately became the prey of an extraordinarily powerful uitsraor. The catastrophe occurred in the thirteenth century. Emblematic image: A wavy line of hills, and above it, a battle between two flocks, white and red.

Yiru is a zatomis of the Ancient Australian metaculture that existed for two thousand years in complete isolation from the rest of humanity in Central Australia. The society evolved into a slave-owning formation. The metaculture perished due to the extraordinary activity of demonic styhials - spirits of the deserts and impenetrable thickets. For many centuries, two religions - "right-hand and left-hand" - fought in the culture: polytheistic and demonic. The latter sacrificed humans to those angry styhials that destroyed the metaculture. In the end, this religion prevailed, and the struggle against the desert and bushes was declared a sin. The culture in Enrof died out due to internal drying up. Painting was the most developed art form. It resembled to some extent the Cretan style but was more interesting and vivid. The remnants of the civilization that will be discovered will not allow to reconstruct the picture due to their insignificance.

Nikisaka is the zatomis of the Japanese metaculture, heavily wounded twice: by Buddhism and Europeanization, and unable to fulfill its potential. Shintoism essentially worships Nikisaka as a Japanese syncretism; the goddess Amaterasu, in the correct understanding of this image, is nothing other than the nation of Japan. The process of moving Nikisaka to the tragically unfinished sakualu in the Enroth metaculture is happening now. The Rose of the World can significantly help strengthen this zatomis: its return is still entirely possible.

### Chapter 3. The Middle Layers of Shadanakar

Before attempting to draw a panorama of the demonic sakuals, which hold such colossal significance for the transphysics and meta-history of Shadanakar, as well as the sakuals of stihialey, some of which are closely related to demonic beginnings, it is advisable to give an idea of several ascending sakuals, as if following the sakuals of zatomis. These sakuals are very diverse, but together they make up the middle layers of Shadanakar.

Naturally, the higher the layers are located hierarchically, the more difficult they are to understand, the fewer analogies with Enroth can be found in their landscapes, in the appearance and form of the beings that inhabit them, and in the content of their lives. Nine-tenths of what is seen or perceived remains incomprehensible, and in most cases, one has to limit oneself to protocol messages about elementary facts, without trying to uncover their regularities or their profound meaning.

Therefore, this chapter promises the reader almost nothing except for a dry list of several sakuals and the layers they make up.

I remember, for example, that in the mysticism of Judaism, the concept of "egregores" is featured. However, it is difficult for me to judge how accurately this term coincides with the content that is invested in it here, at least because of my more than superficial acquaintance with Jewish theosophems. In any case, here egregores are understood as immaterial formations that arise from certain psychic emissions of humanity over large collectives. Egregores are devoid of spiritual monads, but possess temporarily concentrated volitional charge and an equivalent of consciousness. Every state has its own egregore, even Luxembourg. These beings are mostly static and non-aggressive. In the struggle between the demonic and Providence forces of Shadanakar, most egregores do not participate, although there are some that are affiliated with the demonic state.

With the disintegration of egregores, their consciousness equivalents also disappear, dissipating in space. This is not experienced by them as suffering.

Since we can speak about the landscape of these layers, yellowish swirling spaces are characteristic of the Sakuala egregores, in which the egregores appear somewhat denser than the surrounding environment. The seven layers that make up this Sakuala can be listed in the following sequence:

Zativ - the egregores of the initial tribes that die out along with the dissolution of the tribe into a nation or with its physical destruction. Here are also the egregores of the oldest cultural and state formations of humanity, now scattered in space.

Zhag - the region of state egregores. In addition, the egregores of some large contemporary socio-political formations, such as the Indian National Congress party, are located here.

Foraun - the egregores of churches. They are formed from those dark etheric emanations of the human multitude associated with churches, which are introduced by anyone whose soul has not reached righteousness, mixing with their religious states: from worldly thoughts, material interests, acquisition, passionate states - generally from what the fathers of the church called "worldly care." These egregores often become a big obstacle, a burden on the ascending path of churches. Over time, there will be an egregore of the Rose of the World in Foraun: this is inevitable, since the interreligious church of the future will be composed not only of saints, but also of hundreds of millions of people at different stages of the path.

Udgrog - the egregores of anti-church, mass militant parties of the new era.

The layer whose name is unknown to me is inhabited by egregores generated by the psychic activity of the demonic population of shrastri. Similarly, I do not know the name of the layer belonging to the egregores arising from the psychic activity of the world of demons - the same second, brighter humanity, which will be discussed in a few words on the page below.

The last of the egregorial layers is called Cebumr. It is still empty. Over time, there will be an egregore of the impending anti-church here, in which the demonic quasi-religion of worshiping Gagtung will be realized - the core and basis of the impending (at the end of the first eon) devil-humanity.

In a sakual composed of three to four spatial layers with a huge number of temporal coordinates, there lives another, higher humanity of Shadanakar. Unfortunately, my knowledge of it is extremely limited. Many questions that arise when thinking about it remain a wide gap in my broken panorama of Shadanakar. This humanity is called Daimons. It follows a path of development similar to ours, but its beginning was much earlier and more successful. Apparently, the determining factor in this was that the mission of Jesus Christ, which was cut short by the efforts of Gagtung in Enrof and marked only by partial victory, was completely accomplished in the world of Daimons. Chronologically, this happened much earlier than when Christ became incarnate in the form of Jesus. His victory in the world of Daimons removed the heaviest obstacles piled up by Gagtung on their ascending path, and by now, these beings have far surpassed us. The times and sacrifices of their development were reduced by many times. There have been no phenomena of social disharmony among them for a long time, and their forces are directed towards spiritual and aesthetic perfection and towards helping other layers, in particular, the humanity of Enrof.

Daimons are winged beings, partly resembling angels in appearance, but different from them, among many other things, by the presence of two sexes. The main layer of their existence, corresponding to our Enrof, is called Jeram. The nature, similar to ours, has been brought there to a level of high artistic and aesthetic perfection, and the machine civilization is spiritualized by inner wisdom about the powers and layers of Shadanakar and the development of higher abilities in their own being. Daimons know all the essential things about the humanity of Enrof.

Since the completion of Christ's task in Jeram, Daimons have been freed from postmortem descents into demonic worlds of retribution. And the multi-layered sakual of purgatory, which is experimentally known but forgotten by most of us, is replaced for them by a single layer named Urm, where some of them undergo purifying purification in the afterlife. A parallel to our humanity is formed for them by Kartiala, the world of enlightened Daimons, their heavenly country. From there, the ascent to the sakual of High Duty and, finally, to the Synclite of the World is revealed.

Among the many tasks facing the daimons of Kartyala in relation to other worlds of Shadanakar, one is their active participation in the struggle against uitzraors and anti-humanity shrastras; another is their inspiring, creatively guiding influence on the creators of our artistic culture. Testimony to genuine transphysical facts, rather than poetic techniques, are the appeals of some poets to their inspirers - daimons, and of others - to their muses. I do not know if there were nine sisters of Apollo in the Olympus of that time - it is quite possible - but it is beyond doubt that daimons of a feminine nature, muses, or of a masculine nature - Socratic daimons in the narrow sense of the word - contributed to the revelation of the creative depths in the personalities of our artists and thinkers. Only materialistic blindness can make one pass by countless testimonies of this fact from our poets, writers, musicians, philosophers, starting with Socrates and even earlier, and ending with Gogol and Alexander Blok. Most inspiring daimons, having fulfilled their task, depart from those they inspired. Sometimes there is a duality - a phenomenon that is extremely rare and very difficult to explain. There are also cases where human shelters incorporate one embodiment in the world of daimons into their garland. Such an embodiment is given to them in order to consolidate the bright achievements of the soul.

But in the sakuala of daimons, there is also another race, smaller in number, lagging behind in their development and somehow protected by them. The history of their appearance in these worlds is not entirely clear to me; it seems that these are the same daimons that once went astray in ancient times, lost their wings and compensate for the damage inflicted upon themselves on the road of a peculiar redemption. These wingless creatures are almost indistinguishable from humans. Here I come to a fact that will inevitably provoke denial and even indignation in almost every reader of this book. But if we cannot discard words from a song, we cannot discard thoughts from this book. So, those creatures about which I spoke as a lower race of daimons can partly be defined as the archetypes of some heroes of the world literature and art of Enroth. Sometimes, the intuition of the Enroth artists, inherent only to geniuses, perceives in Jheram, contemplates any of these creatures and leads to the creation of its reflection in human art. This reflection becomes like a magical crystal that concentrates the emanations of people that arise during hours of creative perception. These emanations, rising to Jheram, give the archetype the strength to develop. If such a reflection is not created, the development slows down, and in some cases, the archetype may even have to leave the sakuala of daimons and start a slow path in Enroth. Most of the painted and sculpted portraits created in our world are devoid of archetypes: they are portraits of people, no more. But works like, for example, the Mona Lisa, in addition to their human prototype, are precisely associated with the archetypes from Jheram, apprehended by the genius intuition. Hence the extraordinary significance of these masterpieces and their power of influence. It is regrettable that the Mona Lisa was created by Leonardo in such a way that the archetype was lowered, and the portrait included some elements from Duggur - one of the worlds of demonic stihials, as a result of which the archetype suffered a fall from Jheram to Urm because this layer plays the role of purgatory not only for daimons but also for archetypes. Raised by Leonardo, with his posthumous works, Pra-Mona Lisa is now in one of the layers of High Duty. The Venus de Milo is already in Synclite Mira, as the soul of a Greek woman who served as a model for the sculptor in Enroth for this statue, after the historical end of Greco-Roman culture in Enroth, rose through Olympus and precisely to Kartialu Diamonds, where it reunited with its metaprotoform and ascended the staircase to the highest levels. The same will happen in due time with all souls of similar metaportraits.

The situation with works of painting in the genres of mythology, psychology, history, and everyday life is even more complex and diverse. Surikov's Boyarynya Morozova had a metaportrait in Zhérama, as did some of the minor characters in this canvas, and thanks to the artist's creation, it was elevated to Kartialu. At the same time, Surikov is now creating a dazzling version of this painting in the Heavenly Kremlin. Repin's depiction of the murder of Ivan the Terrible's son tied a knot that Repin has not yet untied; he has to untie it in Drukkarg, a stronghold of anti-humanism in Russia that stands in opposition to the Heavenly Kremlin, where Ivan the Terrible is currently a prisoner and a slave.

The situation with Vrubel's "Demon Downcast" is even worse; it is a striking, unique case of a demonic infraportrait. To untie this knot, Vrubel had to descend into Gashsharvu, to the angels of darkness. It is frightening to say, but perhaps it would have been better, despite the genius of this work, if it had perished in Enrof. Landscape painting, despite its enormous cultural and psychological significance, rarely acquires a transphysical value. This happens either in those cases when the artist manages to infect the viewer with his sensation of the worlds of stihials, shining through the nature of Enrof, or to hint at peculiar combinations of lines and colors, suggesting landscapes of some other layer. In my personal opinion, this was achieved most successfully by Rerikh among Russian artists, and sometimes by such a controversial, better to say negated, even helpless artist as Churlenis.

As for artistic literature, there are no meta-images behind the characters of the overwhelming majority of its works. They are devoid of them, for example, with the exception of negligible units, in almost all Soviet literature. There can also be no meta-images for characters in historical genres, for example, Pushkin's Boris or Shakespeare's Caesar. But Macbeth has one, because it is not history. In general, the presence of a meta-image in a work entails a sharp deviation from historical literalness towards endowing the character with a special depth and scale that does not correspond to the historical prototype. This is not the case in Pushkin's drama or Shakespeare's "Caesar"; evidence of the absence of meta-historical depth in these things.

After the death of the artist-creator in Zatomis, the meta-images of his creations are seen by people in Jeram, they meet with him and communicate, because the karma of artistic creativity leads him to them. Many, many geniuses of art have to help the prototypes of their heroes in their ascent after their death. Dostoevsky spent a huge amount of time and effort raising his meta-images, since the suicide of Stavrogin and Svidrigailov, creatively and metamagically dictated by him, threw the proto-Stavrogin and proto-Svidrigailov into Urm. By now, all of Dostoevsky's heroes have been raised by him: Svidrigailov - in Kartialu. Ivan Karamazov and Smerdyakov reached Magirn - one of the worlds of High Duty. There are also Sobakevich, Chichikov, and other heroes of Gogol. Pierre Bezukhov, Andrei Bolkonsky, Princess Mary, and the hardly raised Natasha Rostova from Urm by Tolstoy. Margarita from Gete is already in one of the highest layers of Shadanakar, and Don Quixote has long been in the Synclite of the World, where Faust will soon enter.

I would like to take this opportunity to say a few words about the transcendent significance of theatrical art. The negative attitude towards this art form by Christian religiosity, no matter how it is explained by cultural historians and even religious preachers, was caused by the fact that ancient and medieval Christians, with their, so to speak, religious intuition, unconsciously felt the proximity of theatrical art to an ancient organism that is partly associated with Lilith and partly with an even darker demonic world. A few pages below, this world, called Duggur, will be further characterized by me. Duggur is associated with the sexual sphere of humanity, and although it was not clearly distinguished in the Middle Ages, people felt fear, disgust, and shame before its demonic emanations. The theatrical performance, on the other hand, can be very different, even polar in its transcendent significance. Shalyapin was deeply right in fasting and praying after playing the role of Mephistopheles. The play "The Life of Man" was harmful to both the author, the performers, and the audience because it lacked what the ancients called catharsis. Nevertheless, stage actions that lead the actor and the audience through catharsis - spiritual uplift and at least temporary enlightenment - are deeply justified. As for metaproimages, the significance of Enroth's performances for them is as follows: while Smerdyakov was in Urma, dropped there by the magical-creative influence of Dostoevsky, playing his role on the human stage was burdensome, inhibiting, and painful for him - now it is indifferent. Playing bright roles or roles that lead through catharsis is always good for everyone, including metaproimages.

On the sakual of daimons, my account leaves for a time the four-dimensional worlds: now before us is a lonely, not belonging to any sakual, already five-dimensionally spatial layer, Fongaranda.

It is necessary to give a warning: we are dealing with concepts that are quite unfamiliar. Fongaranda is the layer of the residence of the shelters of great creations of architecture. Here they have the ability to move and grow; their change consists in improvement. Their appearance is similar to that of enlightened stichials, but their form is not filamentous like theirs, and is devoid of the ability of physical interpenetration. It should be understood that the creation of their reflections in Enrof by genius architects, whose intuition caught glimpses of Fongaranda, gives them an ethereal body: inside the physical vessel of the building, it arises from the multi-year radiations of human thousands and millions. If enough time has passed and such a body has been created, the destruction of the physical vessel in Enrof no longer has transphysical significance: the shelter that was in Fongaranda is clothed in an ethereal body and passes into one of the zatomises. After the change of eons, world periods, when the zatomises cease to exist as such, the shelters of these monads with their clothing, already completely altered, will merge in one of the layers of High Duty with their monads and will subsequently enter the Elite of Shadanakar.

Fongaranda is mainly inhabited by the shelters of temple and palace-type creations. For example, there is one grandiose prototype of Orthodox monasteries, one prototype of Egyptian pyramids, ziggurats, gopurams of Southern India, Catholic abbeys, and Rhine castles. But there are also shelters of some individual buildings, such as St. Peter's Cathedral, Basil's Cathedral, the Chinese Temple of Heaven, even the Versailles and Tsarskoye Selo Palaces. There are also shelters such as the London Parliament and the St. Petersburg Admiralty.

After such strange ideas for us, like the world of Phongaranda, the ideas associated with sakual angels will probably seem familiar and even usual. There are two such sakuals. The first, lower one, consists of three layers: it is called the angels of the lower circle. Essentially, this is the first humanity of Shadanakar, which once inhabited layers of denser materiality, although not in Enroth; that era preceded the era of the Titans. We are not able to understand and comprehend the contents of their lives now, in enlightened worlds, we can only grasp that side of their activity that has a direct relation to us. The first of these layers is inhabited by cherubim, the protectors of people - carriers of bright missions. They are protectors, not inspirers - those are the demons! We have heard about guardian angels since childhood, and it's not our fault if we thought that such an angel stands behind the right shoulder of each of us. But their appearance is really as described by tradition, and the landscape of their world is an environment of charming tones that we cannot perceive, remotely reminiscent of pink and lilac.

The other layer - a white-golden environment, permeated with beams of light, belongs to seraphim - the guardians of some human associations: churches, religious communities, some ethical associations, very few cities - those whose spiritual integrity and moral purity have special meaning in the eyes of the Providence principles. There are epochs when the guard of seraphim surrounds some city because a meta-historical event or a certain trans-physical process requiring special assistance or protection takes place in it. After its completion, with the change of epochs, the guard of seraphim departs. This was the case over Kiev under Prince Vladimir the Holy, over Moscow under Princes Daniel and Ivan Kalita, several times over Jerusalem, Rome, and many other cities. A rare case when the guard of seraphim does not leave the city for many centuries is represented by Benares, a city of colossal meta-historical significance. Of course, from a narrow-confessional Christian point of view, reports like this can only cause bewilderment. Seraphim have the appearance of six-winged angels.

Sakuala is completed by the world of so-called Thrones, whose appearance is similar to our conception of archangels, and the environment of their habitation is blue-green, permeated with playing beams of light. Thrones are the guardians of nations. There are many of them: the spiritual formation of each nation requires its own guardian.

Moving on to the second sakual - the Angels of the Higher Circle - I lose the opportunity to make it easier to understand by such poor visual images as in the previous one. I can only say that these are the abodes of the bright hierarchies of immense power, namely those who create the materiality of the three-, four-, and five-dimensional layers of Shadanakar.

First come the astrals known in Christian mysticism as the Powers: they are the creators of the materiality of Enrof. Next are the Dominions, the creators of the materiality of the worlds of Enlightenment (except for Olirna) of the Sakual of the daimons. The Sakual of the Angels of the Higher Circle is crowned by the world of Beginnings, the creators of the materiality of the zatomis, and the Archangels - those who become after the transformation of Sirius, Alkonost, and Gamaun of Heaven, Eden, Montsalvat, Zhunfleya, and the Holy Rose - all the zatomis of the Christian metaculture. They create the materiality of the worlds of High Duty. The materiality of the angelic worlds themselves, as well as the materiality of the higher layers of Shadanakar, are created by the hierarchies of metabramphature.

I know that the presented perfection does not coincide with the traditions of Christian angelology, despite the similarity of names. I am sorry that this is the case. But I am not writing on my own behalf and cannot make changes until the only Voice I fully trust indicates it. The exposition has reached the sakuala of High Duty. These worlds are common to humans, angels, demons, elementals, and even enlightened animals. They float high above those segmentary divisions of Shadanakar called metacultures. Clearly, my information about them is poor, if not impoverished.

I am not even sure of the name of the first one—it sounds similar to Usnorm, but I cannot hear it more precisely. The rotation of the planet around its axis manifests here, and apparently, there was night there, because I vaguely remember the brilliantly beautiful glowing nebula, as if the creative womb of our universe had opened up before my eyes for the first time. That was Astrafire, the great center of our galaxy, hidden from us by the dark clouds of cosmic matter in Enrof.

I saw the scatter of countless stars, but not like ours: they were not stars, but bramfaturas. Not shining dots, but systems of translucent concentric spheres overlapping each other; when my gaze stopped on any of them, it became huge and distinct, as if it had come closer; now it seems to me that they were all slowly rotating, harmoniously sounding and echoing with multi-voiced voices. But perhaps that is only my perception now, and it is influenced by the ideas and harmony of spheres that came to me not from within, but from human tradition. In any case, these harmonies only emerged through the waves of an unimaginable choir sounding here, around me, and rising from such depths and heights that I could neither understand nor measure with my gaze.

This is a memory of a layer that represents the all-encompassing temple intended for the eternal worship of humanity.

Oh, not just humanity! It seems that millions of beings were present here, and I don't know how many of them were never human and were never meant to become human. Enlightened souls of stihia and enlightened souls of animals were here, as well as wondrous daemons and angels of different orders. When we read in the Apocalypse the prophecy of the highly intelligent animals surrounding the altar of another world and performing service, this may be a symbol, but it is also a hint at reality - the reality that did not yet exist in the time of the author of the Apocalypse. Because Usnorn, as a universal temple, is the realization of the idea of that great human spirit who, in his last incarnation on earth, was the apostle John the Theologian. And if there were millions of worshippers there, then the attendants before the throne of the Temple were numbered in the thousands, because everyone who reaches the sakwala of High Duty becomes one of the attendants in Usnorn, and is then replaced by the next one.

The most elevated and well-organized services in the temples of the supreme religions are just weak reflections, echoes of the eternal liturgy of Usnorma. Yes, words participate in this liturgy, but it is an unrepeatable language for us - the Synclicite language of the World, where words are not just individual sounds, but as if meaningful chords, and some of them are also flashes and interflows of light. In this liturgy, movement participates as an element, the heavenly prototype of sacred dance, but in Usnorma, there are five dimensions, and movement is performed not on a horizontal plane, as in our world, but in all five dimensions of space. Light and color participate as elements in the liturgy, but there is no possibility of giving an idea of colors beyond the seven colors that we perceive. What can be said about those light symphonies before which the illumination of Fire seems monotonous and poor? What can be said about spiritual fragrances? About the fimiama of Usnorma, which rise from giant censers that sway and float to ascend to the very Astrafayr? This is the first world where the ascending one perceives not only material but purely spiritual emanations: they originate from the highest transcosmic spheres, which could be called the Empyreum if this ancient word is understood not as a fantastic "world of immovable stars," but as a cosmic dwelling of pure Spirit, that is, the Holy Trinity.

The Worlds of High Obligation are stops between the Zatomises, the Cardial of the daemons, and the Hangvill of the enlightened animals, on the one hand, and the Worlds of Higher Transmiffs of the Supreme Religions on the other. Above Usnorma is Gridruttva - that white palace where the great creative plan of humanity is created. Behind it are Alikanda, similar to the heart of a flower, Tovia, similar to foam, frost, a white garden, falling snow, and Ro - huge singing crystals: their echo is the most beautiful works of music in Enrofa, in Olirna, among the daemons, even in the Zatomises. These three layers are the abodes of human monads reunited with their becoming souls.

Similar to the depth of illuminated seas, the layer of Magirn is the abode of monads, metaproimages, reunited with their shells and with transfigured astral garments. In Kaermis, which can be described as "unlocked sphinxes," the monads of animals unite with their newly-acquired souls, in Deitrist - the monads of daimons, and in Sibran, about which I cannot say anything except that it is an incredible choir of exultation - the monads of angels. In Flauros, which the word "protuberances" can hint at, reside the monads of elementals. The world of High Responsibility, Sakual, also includes Niatos: it is a violet peak where the monads of our former enemies - the demons who turned to the Light - are reunited with their shells. I mentioned the mighty demonic spirit, the great "dragon" of the Primordial Mongolian culture, which was cast by Gagtung into one of the terrible layers, bearing the nickname "Rain of Eternal Melancholy". It has long been raised by Providential principles from there and now shines in the world of the violet peak as one of its most beautiful stars. And as far as I understand, only partly does the colossal and magnificent Iroln belong to this Sakual: the monads of people before their union with their newly-acquired souls. This is the first world that the personal spirit of every person descends to, entering Shadanakar from the Father's bosom. It is like the flow and rotation of many suns. And it is not clear to me: it seems to me that this world is not five, but six dimensions of space, and its inclusion in the Sakual of Higher Responsibility is my mistake, a product of aberration.

Higher up on the hierarchical ladder of Shadanakar are, one after another, the sakuals of cosmic involutions. What does this mean? In the continuing history of Shadanakar, which spans millions of years, active influences from other brafmaturs have occurred and continue to occur: either more powerful than ours, or ahead of us in their development, or finally, comparable to ours in their scale and stages of ascent, but located spatially not so far from us, thus interacting with Shadanakar. The materiality of the worlds of the involutions is created by the bright forces of other brafmaturs; they are inhabited by the highest beings who effortlessly traverse cosmic spaces - these are aliens from other brafmaturs, great helpers and friends of the bright forces of Shadanakar. I cannot say literally anything about some sakuals of the involutions, except for a few names. For example, there is the sakual of the Orion involutions. Orion is a system of brafmaturs of giant power, completely liberated from demonic principles; it plays a colossal role in the life of the Galaxy. Of course, the list of names of the ten layers that make up this sakual cannot cause anything but disappointment with its meager contents. But I don't know - maybe even these names will be useful someday. - Yumaroya. Odgiana. Ramn. Vualra. Ligeia. Fianna. Eramo. Veatnor. Zaolita. Natolis.

Despite the vast differences in the conditions that exist in the physical layers of Jupiter or Neptune compared to our own, we must come to terms with the fact that many planets and their satellites possess bramfaturas. Even in our own layer of Enroth, Jupiter is inhabited by highly intelligent beings that are so different from us and live in such unimaginable conditions that there is never any communication between us. However, communication does exist in the five-dimensional layers of both bramfaturas. The elite of Jupiter and its satellites have created two layers of their involution within Shadanakar, one layer created by Saturn and its satellites, one by Uranus, and one by Neptune. All of these layers make up the sakual of planetary involution.

Three layers hold a special place - Iora, Ahnos, and Gebn. These are the sakuals of involution of the transformed planet Daiya, which no longer exists in Enroth. This planet once rotated between Mars and Jupiter. Demiurgic activity on it led, a long time ago, to the expulsion of demonic forces to its satellite's opposing bramfatura. Daiya entered its third zone, meaning it was physically transformed and disappeared from the world of Enroth. The satellite, however, underwent catastrophic fragmentation (asteroids - its debris) and demonic hordes dispersed into space. When our scientific instruments become strong enough to observe planets from other star systems, we will sometimes witness the sudden disappearance of some of these planets over the course of a few hours. Scientists will likely develop a number of clever hypotheses to explain this phenomenon before they recognize that the same thing that happened to the planet Daiya is occurring in these cases.

Sakuala of solar involutions consists of nine layers. Again, only names... Raos. Flermos. Tramnos. Gimnos. Areya. Nigveya. Trimoya. Derain. Iordis.

And four names for the layers of the Galactic Center's involutions - Astraphire: Grezuar, Malein, Viruana, Luvarn.
The system that is more accurately called Bramfatura only partially belongs to the Sakual involutions, although it is now part of Shadanakar, encompassing its five-dimensional and six-dimensional layers. This is the Lunar Bramfatura.
I don't know exactly when the development of lunar humanity - the Selenites - ended in Enrof; in any case, it happened a very long time ago, almost a million years ago. But development there proceeded much more slowly, although it took significantly less time from the appearance of organic life on the surface of the Moon to the emergence of highly intelligent beings there than for a similar process to occur on our planet. In general, the idea that worlds of smaller physical scale must necessarily evolve faster is not always applicable to specific periods of the development of organic life on them, let alone the pace of development of intelligent beings. But Wells' intuition about the appearance of these beings, described in his fascinating novel, is remarkable, especially considering the rationalistic coloring and scientific plane of his thinking. He guessed the general insectoid appearance of these beings, and the soft-elastic nature of their physical tissues, and the ability of their bodies to change shape depending on their activities, and the height of their technological achievements, and even that the interior of the planet was partly utilized by the end.

The tragedy of the Selenites consisted in the victory of Vogel, the lunar demon of feminine nature. It may seem puzzling how the activity of the feminine-demonic element manifested itself in this rational civilization. However, there is a particular type of rationality, namely, feminine rationality, which is not expressed as weakly as in our humanity. Among the Selenites, it manifested itself with special force and affected, in particular, the fact that their technology was much more magical in its principles than human technology.

The stages of the Selenites' spiritual and cultural decline were as follows: devil-humanity - degeneration - destruction under the weight of technology. The progressing spirituality led to the fact that the wild Selenites could not cope with their own machines and perished from cold and hunger. However, Vogel's world is still included in the Lunar Brahmatry. He has been in a peculiar semi-isolation for an extremely long time, hostile both to the forces of Light and partly to Gaghtungar. But recently, a compromise and even an alliance between him and the planetary demon Shadanakar has been emerging - a consolidation of forces for the expulsion of the forces of Light from Shadanakar. One demonic layer of Shadanakar, called Duggur - we will talk about it later - is closely linked to Vogel's emanations. Now, this blue-gray, seductive and engulfing demoness is restoring a special layer - the lunar hell, where, with Gaghtungar's consent, the victims of Duggur will be cast down; until now, some of these victims have suffered an even more terrible fate - being thrown out of Shadanakar into the voids of the Galaxy.

Three other layers of the Lunar Sakuala oppose Vogel's world. Soldbis is visible from the Zatomis on the face of the Moon: it is the world of the habitation of many enlightened beings - those who tragically lagged behind in their time; their last incarnation in Enrof fell in the era of lunar devil-humanity and degeneration; the entire huge subsequent period was spent on correction and gradual enlightenment in Soldbis. Another world is Laal, the lunar elite. Many Selenites have risen even higher to the Elite of Shadanakar. And finally, the third, brightest of the lunar worlds - Tanit, the abode of the lunar goddess.

If we break down by a subtle analysis into its component strands what we feel on moonlit nights, we will discover the following components of our experience. First: a premonition of harmony; it is evoked by Soldbis and Laal. Second: the subtlest longing for the upper world; it calls us to Tanit. And third: a yearning for sexual abysses; it torments us and tempts us with Voglea. She fears the Sun and always retreats from its radiance to the unilluminated side of the Moon. During full moon, we receive only weakened emanations of Voglea - those that penetrate through the thickness of the earth's satellite. But when the Moon is in decline, Voglea moves together with darkness to its side facing the Earth; that is why lunar decline and new moon nights act so painfully, darkly, and heavily on the subconscious sphere of many of us.

The exposition of the structure of Shadankar has finally reached that grandiose sakuala which I have to designate with painfully cumbersome definitions such as the worlds of what could be called the Higher Aspects of Supreme Religions, their purest transmiffs.

Many years ago, long before the Civil War, when I was still very young, an incomprehensible, beautiful, and relentlessly insistent image appeared to me: a bluish crystal pyramid as if seen from an infinite distance, through which the sun was shining. I felt the enormity of its significance, the waves of grace, power, and beauty pouring out of this glowing center, but I could not understand the meaning of this image. Later, I even thought that it was a reflection of the World's Savior refracted by my limited human consciousness. A child's thought! One whose soul is touched by the reflection of the World's Savior becomes a righteous person and a prophet. And certainly, its reflection has nothing in common with anything earthly.

Only many years later, and quite recently, it became clear to me that this pyramid is not alone, that there are others as if coordinated with it, and there are five of them in total, and the sixth one will never be in Shadankar. But the blue one is truly unique; the others are of different colors, and it is impossible to say which one is more beautiful. Oh, certainly, transmiffs "in themselves" are transcendent for us; perhaps "in themselves" they have no resemblance to any geometric forms. But they touched my consciousness exactly as gigantic crystal pyramids, and apparently, the existence of such images has a deep meaning.

Later, something else struck me: that one of the pyramids, smaller in size but of an astonishing otherworldly whiteness, is the highest transmif of a religion that I personally would never have classified as global or supreme: the transmif of Zoroastrianism. This confusion has still not been dispelled. I still cannot understand how this local religion, which has long since faded in Enrof and, as it seems to me, is not so rich in mythology, turns out to be a reflection of such a colossal reality that is only professed by it. This world is called Azure.

Another pyramid, also of relatively small proportions but golden, is clearer to me. This is the highest aspect of Judaism, the aspect that leaves far behind the anti-Christian irreconcilability of its earthly counterpart, dull and murky. This is the golden world of heavenly glory that shone through the visions of the great mystics of Kabbalah, in the insights of the prophets, and for which the painstaking yarn of the Talmud is like dust in the valleys for the lords of mountain heights. The name of the golden pyramid is Aeh.

The gigantic pyramid, the color of which resembles our lilac, is the highest aspect of the Hindu transmif. This complex world is layered, and its outer layer is the ultimate goal of Vedanta and Yoga, and its highest layer is the Synclite of India, a hint of which we would find in Indian philosophy under the name of Niruddhi. About another layer, Eroia, and one more, whose name I do not have the right to pronounce, I can only say that although those who were once human also live in these worlds, they are more like guests here. The last of the layers of the lilac pyramid is Shatrittva, the abode of many hierarchies of the Hindu pantheon. But to speak of an exact correspondence of the images of this pantheon to the hierarchies of the transmif can only be partly true in individual cases. For example, under the same name Kali-Durgi, completely different instances of the cosmic hierarchy are worshiped in Enrof, from the "All-People's Aphrodite" of India to the Prisnodeva-Mother of the Universe.

No less great is the green pyramid consisting of two tiers, which is the world of the highest aspect of Buddhism. There is a misconception that Buddhism, at least the southern branch, is atheistic. In reality, on the highest levels of Hinayana, as well as Jainism, there is certainly no atheism. However, starting with Gautama and Mahavira, thinkers and preachers believed that it was better for the masses to emphasize the insignificance of the question of God in spiritual salvation, so that the effort would not be transferred to God, which man himself is obliged to make. And how else could those whose Nirvana is the first of the two tiers of the great green pyramid think of God? The second tier belongs to the dhyani-bodhisattvas, the hierarchies that lead the people of the Buddhist meta-culture. The claims of Tibetan spiritual leaders that most Dalai Lamas are reincarnations of the dhyani-bodhisattva Avalokiteshvara should be taken with the utmost seriousness. A literal understanding of this statement would show that the clarity of our consciousness has not yet exceeded the clarity that is achievable within certain denominational frameworks. However, if we understood that the thesis of the reincarnation of Avalokiteshvara in the Dalai Lama's succession line is a form of hint that is tailored to the level of popular understanding, indicating the fact of the inspiration of most Dalai Lamas by this great hierarchy, then we would be close to the truth. The penultimate of the Tibetan Dalai Lamas was not fully inspired, and the current ruler is nothing but a substitution, hence his behavior.

The blue pyramid that has been enticing me for twenty years is the Heavenly Jerusalem, the highest transmyth of Christianity. This is what stands behind the statements of Christian doctrine that are common to Catholics, Orthodox Christians, Lutherans, Abyssinians, and future followers of the Rose of the World. "Statements," I said, but that's not accurate, because what is common to all, what is almost impossible to express in verbal formulas, is the Heavenly Jerusalem, the highest layer of synclites of Christian metacultures, and yet it is not yet the Church. The Church is the highest worlds of Shadanakar. And before we can approach them, we must go back, deep down into the fire and darkness, for without understanding the frightening and formidable demonic sakwal, we cannot approach the higher layers of Shadanakar with our thoughts.
