# Book 1. The Rose of the World and Its Place in History

## Chapter 1. The Rose of the World and Its Immediate Tasks

This book began at a time when an unprecedented disaster loomed over humanity, when a generation barely recovering from the shock of the Second World War was horrified to see a strange gloom gathering on the horizon, a harbinger of an even more menacing catastrophe, an even more devastating war. I began this book during the darkest years of tyranny that ruled over two hundred million people. I started it in a prison known as a political isolator, writing it in secret. I hid the manuscript and kind forces, both human and otherwise, kept it safe during searches. Every day, I expected the manuscript to be seized and destroyed, just as my previous work had been, which took ten years of my life and led me to political isolation.

The book "The Rose of the World" concludes several years later, when the danger of a third world war no longer looms like misty clouds on the horizon, but has spread over our heads, covering the zenith and rapidly descending from it down all sides of the sky. But maybe it will be averted? Such hope glimmers in the heart of everyone, and it would be impossible to live without such hope. Some try to reinforce it with logical arguments and active actions. Some manage to persuade themselves that the danger is exaggerated. Others try not to think about it at all, immersing themselves in the concerns of their small world and deciding once and for all: let whatever happens, happen. And there are those in whose soul the hope smolders as a dying spark, who live, move, and work only by inertia.

I am finishing the manuscript of "The Rose of the World" at liberty, in a golden autumn garden. The one under whose yoke the country had been exhausted is already reaping the fruits of what he has sown in other worlds. And yet, I hide the last pages of the manuscript just like I hid the first, and I dare not dedicate its content to any living soul, and I still have no confidence that the book will not be destroyed, that the spiritual experience with which it is saturated will be transmitted to anyone.

But perhaps it will be enough, and tyranny will never return? Perhaps humanity will forever keep the memory of Russia's terrible historical experience? Such hope is kindled in the heart of everyone, and without this hope, it would be nauseating to live.

But I belong to those who have been fatally wounded by two great disasters: world wars and solitary tyranny. Such people do not believe that the roots of wars and tyrannies have already been overcome in humanity or will be overcome in a short time. Perhaps the danger of this tyranny, this war, can be removed, but some time later the threat of the next one will arise. Both of these disasters were apocalypses for us - revelations of the power of world Evil and its eternal struggle with the forces of Light. People of other eras probably would not understand us; our anxiety would seem exaggerated to them, our worldview - painful. But such an understanding of historical regularities, which has been burned into human beings by half a century of contemplation and participation in events and processes of unprecedented scale, is not exaggerated. And that outcome, which has formed in the human soul as a result of the activity of its brightest and deepest sides, cannot be painful.

I am seriously ill, and the years of my life are counted. If the manuscript is destroyed or lost, I will not have time to restore it. But if it reaches at least a few people someday whose spiritual thirst will compel them to read it to the end, overcoming all its difficulties, the ideas laid out in it cannot help but become seeds, giving rise to shoots in other hearts.

And whether this will happen before the third world war or after it, or whether the third war will not be unleashed in the coming years at all - the book will not die anyway if at least one friendly pair of eyes passes, chapter by chapter, through its pages. Because the questions it tries to answer will still concern people in the distant future.

These questions are not exhausted by the issues of war and state structure. However, nothing shakes my conviction that the most terrifying dangers that threaten humanity now and will continue to threaten for many centuries are the great suicidal war and absolute worldwide tyranny. Perhaps in our era, humanity will surpass or at least survive the third world war, as it did in the first and second. Perhaps it will endure, somehow, a tyranny even more extensive and merciless than the one we endured. It is also possible that in a hundred or two hundred years, new dangers for peoples will arise that are no less deadly than tyranny and the great war, but different. It is possible. Probable. But no effort of reason, no imagination or intuition can depict the impending dangers that would not be in some way connected with one of the two main ones: the danger of the physical destruction of humanity due to war and the danger of its spiritual death due to absolute worldwide tyranny.

The book is aimed primarily against these two evils. Two fundamental, primary evils. It is aimed against them not as a pamphlet, not as an exposing satire, not as a sermon. The most scorching satire and the most fiery sermon are fruitless if they only lash out at evil and prove that good is good and bad is bad. They are fruitless if they are not based on knowledge of the foundations of that worldview, that universal doctrine and that effective program that, spreading from mind to mind and from will to will, would be capable of turning these two fundamental dangers away from humanity. To share my experience with others, to open up the picture of historical and meta-historical perspectives, the branching chain of dilemmas facing us or likely to arise, the panorama of different material worlds, closely interrelated with us in good and evil - that is the task of my life. I sought and seek to fulfill it in the forms of verbal art, in prose and poetry, but the peculiarities of this art did not allow me to reveal the entire concept with the necessary completeness, to present it exhaustively, clearly, and accessibly. To unfold this concept precisely in this way, to make it understood how it, interpreting the supernatural, at the same time holds the key to both the current processes of history and the fate of each of us - that is the task of this book. A book that, if the Lord preserves it from destruction, must be inserted, like one of many bricks, into the foundation of the Rose of the World, into the basis of all-human Brotherhood.

There is an institution that has claimed for centuries to be the sole unswerving unifier of people, preventing them from the danger of a war of all against all, the danger of falling into chaos. Such an institution is the state. Since the end of the clan system, the state has been an essential necessity at every historical stage. Even hierocracies, attempting to replace it with religious power, turned into varieties of the same State. The state cemented society on the basis of violence, and the level of moral development necessary to cement society on some other principle has not been achieved. Of course, it has not been achieved to this day. The state still remains the only proven means against social chaos. However, the existence of higher ethical principles in humanity, capable not only of maintaining but also improving social harmony, is becoming clear. What is even more important, paths of accelerated development of these principles are emerging.

In the political history of modern times, two polar directions can be easily distinguished. One of them aims at the further development of the state principle as such, at strengthening the comprehensive dependence of the individual on the state, more precisely, on the entity that controls the state apparatus: parties, armies, leaders. States of the fascist or national-socialist type are the brightest examples of such phenomena. The other stream of events, which emerged already in the 18th century, if not earlier, is the stream of humanistic orientation. Its origins and main stages are English parliamentarianism, the French Declaration of Human Rights, the German Social Democracy, and finally, the liberation struggle against colonialism. The ultimate goal of this stream of events is to weaken the cementing violence in the lives of peoples and transform the state from a predominantly police apparatus defending national or class domination into an apparatus of universal economic balance and protection of individual rights. There are still original formations in historical reality that may appear as hybrids. Essentially remaining phenomena of the first type, they alter their own appearance to the extent that it is appropriate to achieve the set goal. This is only tactics, masking, nothing more.

Despite the polarity of these streams of phenomena, they are united by one characteristic that is most typical of the 20th century: a striving towards the universal. The external pathos of various movements of our era is expressed in their constructive programs for national organization; but the internal driving force of modern history is a spontaneous urge towards the universal.

The most powerful movement of the first half of our century was distinguished by the internationalism of its doctrine and the planetary scale of its aspirations. The Achilles' heel of the movements that opposed it - racism and national socialism - was their narrow nationalism, or rather, the narrow racial or national borders of the blissful zones that they tempted and mesmerized. However, they too sought world domination, and with tremendous energy. Now, cosmopolitan Americanism is preoccupied with avoiding the mistakes of its predecessors.

What does this sign of the times indicate? Does it not point to the fact that universality, which used to be an abstract idea, has become a universal necessity? Does it not suggest that the world has become indivisible and cramped as never before? Does it not imply that a radical and lasting solution to all urgent problems can only be achieved on a universal scale?

Despotic regimes systematically implement the principle of extreme violence, or cleverly combine methods to veil it. The pace is accelerating. Such colossal states are emerging that would have taken centuries to construct in the past. Each, being predatory in its nature, strives to impose its own power on humanity. Their military and technological power is becoming dizzying. They have already plunged the world into the abyss of wars and tyranny so many times - what guarantees are there that they will not do it again and again? And finally, the strongest will prevail on a global scale, even if it means turning a third of the planet into a lunar landscape. Then the cycle will end, giving way to the greatest of all evils: a single dictatorship over the surviving two thirds of the world - first, perhaps, oligarchic, and then, as is usually the case in the second stage of dictatorships, autocratic. This is the most terrifying threat of all that hangs over humanity: the threat of a universal tyranny.

Consciously or unconsciously sensing this danger, movements of humanistic orientation are trying to consolidate their efforts. They babble about cultural cooperation, wave pacifist and democratic freedom slogans, seek illusory salvation in neutrality, or, frightened by the aggressiveness of the enemy, themselves take his path. None of them has put forward the indisputable goal, namely the idea that ethical control is urgently necessary over the activities of states. Some societies, traumatized by the horrors of world wars, are trying to unite in order to subsequently embrace the whole earth in a political union. But what would that lead to now? The danger of wars, true, would be eliminated, at least temporarily. But where are the guarantees that this superstate, relying on extensive morally backward layers - and there are much more of them in the world than one would like - and stirring up the not yet eradicated instincts of ambition and torment in humanity, will not turn into a dictatorship and, finally, into a tyranny that will make all previous ones look like a joke?

It is significant that it is precisely religious denominations that were the first to proclaim the international ideals of brotherhood, which now find themselves in the rearguard of the general trend towards a universal. Perhaps this is due to their characteristic concentration on the inner man, disregard for everything external, and the external also includes the problem of the social organization of humanity. But if you look deeper, if you say out loud what is usually only said in narrow circles of people living an intensive religious life, something will be revealed that not everyone takes into account. This is the mystical horror that arose in the days of the ancient Roman Empire in anticipation of the coming unification of the world, this is an insatiable anxiety for humanity, because a trap is felt in a single universal state, from where the only way out will be to absolute despotism, to the kingdom of "the prince of this world", to the last cataclysms of history and its catastrophic break.

And indeed, where are the guarantees that at the head of this super-state will not be a great ambitious person, and science will serve him faithfully and truthfully as a tool for turning this super-state into that monstrous machine of torture and spiritual mutilation that I am talking about? Can there be any doubt that even now there are prerequisites for inventing perfect control over people's behavior and their way of thinking? What are the limits of those nightmarish perspectives that arise before our imagination as a result of the intersection of two factors: terrorist dictatorship and 21st-century technology? Tyranny will be all the more absolute as then there will be no last, tragic path of liberation: the crushing of tyranny from the outside as a result of military defeat - there will be no one left to fight, everyone will be subservient. And the world unity, dreamed of by so many generations, demanding so many sacrifices, will turn into its demonic side: its hopelessness in the event that the leadership of this unity is taken by adherents of dark forces.

On bitter experience, humanity is already convinced that neither the socio-economic movements whose leadership is taken up by bare reason nor the achievements of science itself are capable of leading humanity between Scylla and Charybdis – tyrannies and world wars.

Worse yet, new socio-economic systems, when they come to power, themselves become adorned with mechanisms of political despotism, becoming the sowers and instigators of world wars. Science becomes their obedient servant, far more obedient and reliable than the church was for feudal lords. The tragedy lies in the fact that scientific activity from the very beginning was not coupled with deeply thought-out moral education. All were admitted to this activity regardless of their level of moral development. It is not surprising that every success of science and technology now turns against the true interests of humanity. The internal combustion engine, radio, aviation, atomic energy – all strike at the living flesh of peoples with one end. And the development of means of communication and technical achievements that allow the police regime to monitor the intimate life and secret thoughts of each person bring an iron base under the vampiric piles of dictatorships.

Thus, the experience of history brings humanity to the understanding of the obvious fact that dangers will be prevented and social harmony achieved not by the development of science and technology themselves, not by the overdevelopment of the state element, not by the dictatorship of the "strong man," not by the coming to power of pacifist organizations of the social-democratic type, rocked by historical winds from powerlessness and idealism to revolutionary maximalism – but by recognizing the urgent need for one and only path: the establishment of some untainted, incorruptible, highly authoritative institution over the World Federation of States, an ethical, non-state and supranational institution, because the nature of the state is unethical by its very essence.

What idea, what doctrine will help create such control? What minds will develop it and make it acceptable to the vast majority? By what means will such an institution come to universal recognition, to a height dominating even the Federation of States – rejecting violence? But if it takes as a guiding principle the gradual replacement of violence with something else, then what exactly and in what sequence? And what doctrine will be able to resolve all the emerging problems with their incredible complexity?

This passage is from a book that aims to answer certain questions, although its overall theme is wider. Before providing an answer, it is important to clearly formulate what this doctrine sees as its greatest enemy and what it is directed against.

In historical terms, it sees its enemies in any state, party, or doctrine that seeks to violently enslave others and any form of despotic governance. In a meta-historical sense, its enemy is one thing: the spirit of tyranny, the Great Tormentor, manifesting itself in various ways throughout the history of our planet. For the movement being discussed, both now, when it is barely emerging, and later, when it becomes the decisive voice of history, the enemy will be one thing: the desire for tyranny and cruel violence, wherever it arises, even within the movement itself. Violence can only be considered justifiable to the extent of extreme necessity, only in softened forms and only until the highest authority, through improved education, prepares humanity to replace coercion with voluntariness, the external voice of law with the voice of a deep conscience, and states with brotherhood. In other words, until the essence of the state is transformed, and a living brotherhood replaces the soulless apparatus of state violence.

It is not necessary to assume that such a process will necessarily take a huge amount of time. Historical experience of great dictatorships, which covered huge countries with an extraordinary energy and consistency of a carefully planned system of education and upbringing, has convincingly demonstrated the leverage of this method of influencing generations' mentality. Generations were formed closer and closer to what was desirable for the ruling authorities. Nazi Germany, for example, managed to achieve its goals even in the eyes of one generation. Of course, nothing but anger and disgust can evoke its ideals in us. Not only its ideals - even its methodology must be almost completely rejected by us. But the lever it has opened must be taken in our hands and firmly grasped. The century of the triumph of broad spiritual enlightenment and decisive achievements of a new, barely emerging pedagogy is approaching. If at least a few dozen schools were entrusted to it, a generation capable of fulfilling its duty not by coercion, but by free will, not out of fear, but out of creative impulse and love would be formed there. This is the essence of the education of a person of an ennobled type.

It seems to me that an international organization, political and cultural, aiming at transforming the essence of the state through the consistent implementation of all-encompassing reforms, should be created. The decisive step towards this goal is the creation of a World Federation of States as independent members, but with a special body established over the Federation that controls the activities of states and directs their bloodless and painless transformation from within. It is precisely bloodless and painless - that is what it is all about, that is what distinguishes it from past revolutionary doctrines.

What the structure of this organization will be, what its name will be - it seems premature and unnecessary to predict. Let us conditionally call it, so as not to repeat lengthy descriptions each time, the League for the Transformation of the Essence of the State. As for its structure, those who will become its organizers will be more experienced and practical than I am: they will be public figures, not poets. I can only say that personally, it seems to me that the League should have its branches in all countries, and each branch should have several aspects: cultural, philanthropic, educational, and political. Such a political aspect of each branch will structurally and organizationally transform into a national party of the World Religious and Cultural Reform.

I do not know how, where, and among whom the formation of the League will take place, and I cannot know. But it is clear that the period from its inception until the creation of a federation of states and an ethical institution above them should be considered a preparatory period, a period when the League will devote all its efforts to the dissemination of its ideas, the formation of its ranks, the expansion of the organization, the education of the younger generation, and the creation within itself of that future institution to which the world leadership role may eventually be entrusted.

The League's charter cannot prevent people of different philosophical and religious beliefs from joining its ranks. All that is required is a willingness to actively participate in implementing its program and a determination not to violate its moral principles, which are accepted as the cornerstone.

In all the vicissitudes of social life and political struggle, the successes of the League must be achieved not by deviating from its moral code, but precisely because of its adherence to it. Its reputation must be unblemished, its selflessness beyond doubt, and its authority growing, because the best forces of humanity will gather in it and continuously strengthen it.

Most likely, the path to global unity will lie through a ladder of various stages of international solidarity, through the union and merger of regional communities. The final step of this ladder is represented by a global referendum or plebiscite - some form of free expression of will of all. Perhaps it will lead to the victory of the League only in certain countries. But the historical course of events will be on its side. The unification of at least half of the globe will complete a profound shift in the consciousness of peoples. A second referendum will take place, maybe a third, and a decade earlier or later the boundaries of the Federation will coincide with the boundaries of humanity. Then a practical opportunity will arise to carry out a chain of broad measures aimed at transforming the conglomerate of states into a monolith, gradually transformed by two parallel processes: external - political, social, and economic, and internal - educational, ethical, and religious.

It is clear from all this that the leaders of the League and its national parties will be able to fight only with words and their own example, and only with those ideologies and doctrines that seek to clear the way for any dictatorships or support these dictatorships at the levers of power. The League will see its historical predecessors in the great Mahatma Gandhi and the party inspired by him, although they acted on a narrow national scale. The first statesman-righteous in modern history, he established a purely political movement based on high ethics and refuted the prevailing opinion that politics and morality are incompatible.

But the national boundaries within which the Indian National Congress acted will be expanded by the League to planetary boundaries, and its goals will be the next historical step or series of steps compared to those set by the great party that liberated India.

Oh, of course there will be many people who will claim that the League's methodology is impractical and unrealistic. Oh, how I despise these advocates of political realism! There is no immorality, no social repulsiveness that has not been covered by this pathetic fig leaf. There is no weight more deadly, more grounding, than talk of political realism as a counterweight to everything winged, everything inspiring, everything spiritual. Political realists, among other things, are those who once claimed, even in India itself, that Gandhi was a fantasist and a dreamer. They had to grit their teeth and bite their tongues when Gandhi and his party, precisely on the path of high ethics, achieved the country's liberation and led it further towards prosperity. Not towards external prosperity that blinds people with black dust from figures on coal production growth or radioactive ash from experimental hydrogen bomb explosions, but towards cultural, ethical, and aesthetic prosperity - spiritual prosperity that slowly but surely pulls material prosperity along with it. Those who are unable to see the best in human beings, whose psyche has become coarse and whose conscience has become dull in an atmosphere of rough state tyranny, will also accuse the League of being unrealistic in its methods. They will be joined by those who do not foresee the shifts in mass consciousness that await us in the near years. The trauma of wars, repressions, and all sorts of violence still evokes a broad movement for coexistence and peace. Events constantly occur and will occur that destroy the sense of security, leaving nothing of comfort and peace, undermining the roots of trust in existing ideologies and the order of things they protect. The exposure of unheard-of horrors perpetrated behind pompous dictatorships, the vivid realization of what their temporary victories were erected on and what they were paid for - all this parches the soul like scorching wind, and the thirst for spirituality becomes unbearable. About the removal of the threat of great wars; about the paths to uniting the world without bloodshed; about the light-bearer and righteous one who is coming to lead humanity; about the weakening of state violence and the growth of the spirit of brotherhood - this is what the faithful pray for and what the non-believers dream of in our time. And it is highly probable that the all-encompassing winged doctrine - moral, political, philosophical, and religious - will embody this generation's thirst for an all-national creative enthusiasm.

The fact that the last major religious movement in humanity, the Protestant Reformation, took place four hundred years ago, while the last global religion, Islam, has already existed for thirteen centuries, is sometimes put forward as an argument in favor of the opinion that the religious era in humanity has ended. However, the potential possibilities of religion as such, and not of its separate forms, should be judged not by how long its last major forms emerged, but by whether the evolution of religion has reached a dead end, whether it is possible to combine religious creative thought with indisputable scientific theses, and also by whether there are prospects for understanding the material of new epochs with such a worldview and whether religion can have a effective and progressive impact on this material.

Indeed, about four hundred years have passed since the last major international religious movement. But weren't there few such movements before the Protestant Reformation? And is that the point? Isn't it already clear that a certain channel of humanity's ideological and creative work in recent centuries has absorbed almost all its spiritual and intellectual forces? It would be difficult to expect that while achieving such rapid progress - scientific, technical, and social, creating such cultural values as literature, music, philosophy, art, and science in recent centuries, humanity would also find the strength to simultaneously create universal religious systems.

The turn of the 20th century marked the end of the flourishing of great literature, art, music, and philosophy. The realm of social and political action increasingly involves not the most spiritual representatives of humanity, but rather the least spiritual, and this trend is becoming more pronounced. A huge spiritual vacuum has formed that did not exist even fifty years ago, and hypertrophied science is powerless to fill it. If I may use this expression, the colossal resources of human genius are not being utilized anywhere. This is the womb of creative forces in which the predetermined birth of a universal inter-religion is maturing.

Will religion be able to prevent the most ominous dangers that threaten humanity, not in its old forms, but in the religion of the future, which the world is now pregnant with: world wars and world tyranny? It is probably unable to prevent the imminent world war; if a third war breaks out, this disaster will likely occur before even the League can emerge. But preventing all wars, the dangers of which will arise after the nucleus of the forthcoming inter-religion is formed, as well as preventing world tyranny, is its immediate goal. Can this religion achieve the greatest harmony between personal freedom and the interests of humanity, which is only imaginable at this stage of history? But this is just another aspect of its immediate goal. Will it contribute to the comprehensive development of the creative abilities inherent in humans, except for demonic abilities, which are the abilities to tyrannize, torture, and assert oneself at the expense of other living beings? Yes. Does it require bloody sacrifices for its triumph, like other world-oriented movements? No, except in cases where its preachers may have to testify to their loyalty to the idea with their own blood. Do its theses contradict the objective and universally binding theses of modern science, not the philosophical doctrine of materialism (which they, of course, contradict in all respects from A to Z)? Not in a single letter or number. Can we foresee the establishment of a regime in the era of its hegemony where dissent will be persecuted, and where it will impose its dogmas on philosophy, science, and art? On the contrary, from partial restrictions on freedom of thought at first, to unlimited freedom of thought later, that is the path it proposes. What remains of the argument that religion is incapable of answering pressing questions of the time, let alone practically resolving them?

With full right and reason, such reproach can be thrown not at religion, but unfortunately at science. It is precisely the system of views that does not look beyond the boundaries of what is circumscribed by modern scientific knowledge, neither to the right nor to the left, that is incapable of answering the most fundamental, most elementary questions. - Does the First Cause, Creator, God exist? Unknown. - Does the soul or something similar to it exist, and is it immortal? Science does not know this. - What is time, space, matter, energy? Opinions sharply diverge on this. - Is the world eternal and infinite, or, on the contrary, limited in time and space? Science does not have the material for a solid answer to these questions. - Why should I do good and not evil if I like evil and can protect myself from punishment? The answers are completely incomprehensible. - How to use science to prevent the possibility of wars and tyrannies? Silence. - How to achieve social harmony with the least number of victims? Mutually exclusive proposals are put forward, similar only in one thing: that they all are equally unrelated to strict science. Naturally, on such shaky, subjective, truly pseudo-scientific foundations, teachings of class, racial, national, and party egoism arose, that is, precisely those whose vocation is to justify dictatorships and wars. Low spirituality is a characteristic feature of such teachings. Therefore, the sought-after ethical instance can be built not on the so-called scientific worldview - which, in fact, does not exist - but on participation in the spiritual world, on the perception of rays flowing from there into the heart, mind, and conscience, and on the implementation of the covenant of active and creative love in all spheres of life. The moral level, fully corresponding to the enumerated characteristics, is called righteousness.

Another prejudice is also widespread: the view of religion as a reactionary phenomenon by its very nature, especially in our era. However, to speak of the reactionariness or obsolescence of religion in general, regardless of its specific forms, is as meaningless as proving the reactionariness of art or philosophy in general. Those who think dynamically, who see evolving series of facts and processes that shape these series, can discern reactionary and progressive forms in art, religion, and any area of human activity. Reactive forms of religion can be encountered as much as one would like, and even more than one would like, but this has no bearing on the emerging religion of the outcome to which this book is dedicated. For in our century, there have been and are no more progressive goals or methods than those united with this religion. As for claims of scientific method to some sort of superiority, the scientific method is just as powerless to supplant artistic and religious methods in the broad sense of the word, as aggressive religiosity was unable to do so in its time. Because these methods differ not only in how they do things but also in what they know. In the past century, under the influence of rapid progress in science and technology, the death of art was prophesied. A hundred years have passed, and the flowering of the arts has not only not died, but has been enriched by one more: the art of cinema. Forty or thirty years ago, the inevitable demise of religion in Russia due to scientific and social progress seemed to many. However, the flowering of religions not only did not die, despite all the means mobilized for this purpose, but it is precisely under the influence of scientific and social progress that it is enriched by what will make world religiosity a complete and unified spiritual flower - the Rose of the World.

From all that has been said, it follows that a religious movement that includes in its worldview and practice the positive experience of humanity and draws conclusions from the negative that require too much courage and integrity to be made on the paths of other trends in public thought; a movement that places transformation of the state into a brotherhood, the unification of the earth, and the education of a refined human being as its immediate goals; a movement that will protect itself from the distortion of the ideal and methodology with the unbreakable armor of high morality - such a movement cannot but be recognized as progressive, prospective, and creatively young.

Armor of morality! But on what basis can such morality be created? I spoke about righteousness. But is not righteousness the utopia of entire social circles, not individuals?

It should be clarified what is meant here by righteousness. Righteousness is not necessarily the fruit of monastic asceticism. Righteousness is the highest stage of a person's moral development; one who has surpassed it is no longer righteous but a saint. The forms of righteousness, however, are diverse; they depend on time, place, and human character. One can say in general: righteousness - in its negative aspect - is such a state of a person, stable and ending only with their death, in which their will is freed from impulses of self-love, reason - from captivity by material interests, and the heart - from the boiling of random, murky, soul-degrading emotions. In the positive aspect, righteousness is the penetration of active love for God, people, and the world into all external and internal activities of a person.

The psychological climate for the emergence of a moral authority based on righteousness is unlikely to be prepared better anywhere than in a society united in the hope of its emergence and seeing its meaning and purpose in this. But it is precisely such a society that should be the League. Among its members may even be atheists. But the League's main thesis is the necessity of a worldwide ethical authority above states, and it is this that will unite the most inspired, creative, active, and talented members into its core. A core characterized by an atmosphere of constant spiritual creativity, active love, and purity. A core consisting of people who are enlightened enough to understand not only the danger threatening each of them due to the unbridled impulses of self, but also the danger of too external a understanding of religious and moral values, which leads to ethical formalism, hypocrisy, spiritual callousness, and sanctimoniousness.

No one but the Lord God knows where and when the first flame of the Rose of the World will ignite. The country - Russia - is only indicated; tragic events that complicate the performance of this mystical act and force it to be postponed to another country are still possible. The era - the 1960s of our century - is only outlined; deadly cataclysms that will push this date far into the future are possible. Perhaps the environment where the first flame ignites will not be the League for the transformation of the essence of the state, but another, as yet unpredictable circle of people. But whether there or here, in this country or another, earlier or later by a decade, the interreligious, all-human church of the new times, the Rose of the World, will appear as the result of the spiritual activity of many, as the collective creativity of people who have become recipients of a pouring stream of revelation - it will emerge, arise, and enter onto the historical path.

Religion, inter-religion, church - I cannot achieve the necessary precision using any of these words. A number of its fundamental differences from old religions and churches will eventually compel the use of different words in reference to it. But even without that, the introduction of this book requires the use of such an extensive range of new words that it is preferable, at the very beginning, to resort not to these words, but to a descriptive definition of the distinctive features of what should be called the Rose of the World.

This is not a closed religious denomination, true or false. This is not an international religious society like Theosophical, Anthroposophical or Masonic, composed, like a bouquet, of individual colors of religious truths, eclectically gathered in all sorts of religious meadows. This is an inter-religion or pan-religion in the sense that it should be understood as a universal teaching that points to such a perspective on previously arisen religions, in which they all turn out to be reflections of different layers of spiritual reality, different series of immaterial facts, different segments of the planetary cosmos. This perspective embraces Shambhala as a whole and as part of the divine cosmos of the universe. If old religions are petals, then the Rose of the World is a flower: with roots, stem, cup, and all the community of its petals.

The second difference is the universality of the aspirations of the Rose of the World and their historical concreteness. No religion, except medieval Catholicism, ever set itself the task of transforming the social body of humanity. However, the papacy, which stubbornly sought to contain the feudal chaos with the dams of hierocracy, failed to weaken the exploitation of the poor by the rich, reduce social inequality through sweeping reforms, or increase general prosperity. However, it would be unfair to blame the leading Catholic hierarchy for this: there were no material means, neither economic nor technical, for such transformations. The evil of the world was felt from time immemorial and remained ineradicable until modern times, and Catholicism, in essence, like all other religions, addressed only the "inner man" and taught personal improvement. But times have changed, material means have appeared, and the merit of the entire historical process, rather than the Rose of the World itself, is that it can now view social transformations not as external, doomed to failure and not worthy of effort, but in an inseparable connection with the improvement of the inner world of man: now these are two parallel processes that must complement each other. One often hears, "Christianity failed." Yes, if it were all in the past, it could be said that in social and universal-moral terms it had not succeeded. "Religion failed." Yes, if religious creativity of humanity had exhausted itself with what had already been created, religion in the aforementioned sense would indeed have failed. But for now, it is only fair to say that the old religions could not achieve a significant reduction in social evil because they did not have the necessary material means, and the absence of these means provoked their negative attitude towards all such attempts. This prepared the way for the irreligious stage of civilization. In the 18th century, social consciousness awakened. Social disharmony was finally felt and recognized as something unacceptable, offensive, and requiring overcoming. Of course, this was connected with the fact that material means began to appear. But the old religions did not understand this, did not want to use these means, did not wish to lead the process of social transformation, and it is in this narrow-mindedness, intellectual laziness, and ideological immobility that their heaviest guilt lies. Religion discredited itself with centuries of helplessness in this regard, so it is not surprising that Europe and then other continents fell into the opposite extreme of transforming society purely by mechanical means while completely rejecting the spiritual side of the same process. It is no wonder, of course, that the outcome was upheavals such as the world had never seen, scales of victims that had never even been imagined, and such a lowering of the ethical level that the very possibility of which in the 20th century still seems to many a dark and tragic mystery. Old religions bear a significant responsibility for the depth and persistence of the subsequent irreligious stage, for the spiritual fate of millions of souls who, in the struggle for a just world order, opposed religion in general and thereby uprooted the roots of their existence from the womb of world spirituality. But true religious activity is a kind of public service, and true public service is at the same time religious activity. No religious act, not even the feat of a monk, can be isolated from the general work for the benefit of universal enlightenment; and no social activity, except for demonic ones, can fail to influence the increase in the sum of world good, that is, not have a religious meaning. The beating of social conscience, effective social compassion and rejoicing, incessant practical efforts to transform the social body of mankind - these are the second differences of the Rose of the World from ancient religions.

The third difference is the dynamism of its views. Religions that are not alien to meta-history, such as Judaism and early Christianity, existed, but only in distant and short periods of their development did they attempt to spiritually comprehend the current historical process. In those short, half-forgotten epochs, the striking insights of the Apocalypse remained covered from people's eyes by a veil of innuendos and insinuations; the cipher of images allowed for all sorts of interpretations. True understanding of the historical process never took place. The historical experience was still small and narrow, the geographic horizon was negligible, the mystical mind was not prepared to grasp the internal laws of meta-history and the incredible complexity of Shadanakar. But the era of the hegemony of science preceded the phenomenon of the Rose of the World, shaking up the conception of the universe, nations, cultures, and their destiny at the very root. It was also preceded by another thing: an era of radical shifts and upheavals in society, an era of revolutions and planetary wars. Both series of phenomena stirred up psychological strata that had been stagnant for so many centuries. Seeds of meta-historical revelation fall into the soil torn up by the iron teeth of historical catastrophes. And the planetary cosmos(^1) opens up to spiritual vision as an ever-changing system of worlds with multiple meanings, rushing towards a dazzling goal, becoming spiritualized and transformed from century to century, from day to day. Rows of upcoming epochs begin to shine through, each with its own unique characteristics and a combination of meta-historical elements struggling within it. The aim of the Rose of the World is to become a receiver, multiplier, and interpreter of this knowledge. As the mystical collective mind of humanity, she will comprehend the historical process in its past, present, and future in order to enter into creative leadership of it. If it is possible to speak of any dogmas in her teachings, then it is a deeply dynamic, multi-aspect, and capable of further enrichment and development, of long-term improvement.

____________
(^1): By planetary cosmos is meant the totality of layers of various materiality, of different spatial and temporal coordinates, but invariably connected with the sphere of the Earth as a planet. The planetary cosmos is the earthly sphere in all the complexity of its material (not just physical) layers of existence. Similar powerful systems exist for many celestial bodies. They are called brahmaturas. The brahmatura of the Earth is named Shadanakar. As for these words, like many others used here for the first time or changed in meaning with new implications, it is worth looking at a small dictionary attached at the end.

From this follows another, fourth, distinction of the Rose of the World: the perspective of consecutive spiritual-historical tasks, which are quite specific and fundamentally achievable. I will list again the nearest ones: the unification of the Earth into a Federation of states with an ethical controlling body over it, the spread of material prosperity and a high cultural level to the population of all countries, the upbringing of generations in an ennobled image, the reunification of Christian churches and a free union with all religions of a bright direction, the transformation of the planet into a garden and states into brotherhood. But these are only first priority tasks. Their implementation will open the way to solving even higher tasks: the spiritualization of nature.

So, interreligiousness, the universality of social aspirations and their specificity, the dynamism of views and the sequence of world-historical tasks - these are the features that distinguish the Rose of the World from all religions and churches of the past. The bloodlessness of its paths, the painlessness of its reforms, kindness and tenderness towards people, waves of emotional warmth spreading around - these are the features that distinguish it from all political and social movements of the past and present.

It is clear that the essence of the state, as well as the ethical character of society, cannot be transformed in an instant. A complete rejection of coercion from the outset is a utopia. However, this element will diminish over time and in public space. Every discipline consists of elements of coercion and consciousness, and the proportion between these two elements determines the type of discipline. The discipline of slave economies, prisons, and concentration camps has the highest percentage of coercion and almost no consciousness. A little more consciousness is present in military drill. And as the element of coercion weakens in disciplinary systems, the categorical imperative of self-discipline will replace it. The entire new pedagogy will be based on cultivating this impulse. The principles and methods of this pedagogy, as well as the methods of re-educating and rehabilitating criminals, will be discussed in one of the last chapters. But it is already clear, it seems, that the stimulus of external coercion will rapidly diminish in the inner concentric circles of the Rose of the World. For it will be these people, who have completely fused their lives with its tasks and ethics, and who no longer need external coercion, who will fill these inner circles. It is precisely these people who will be its conscience, and who else but them should occupy the seats of the Supreme Council?

And can we overestimate the educational value of such social structures, when at the top of society there are leaders who create and act with the greatest dignity: not those whose willpower is hypertrophied at the expense of other faculties of the soul and whose strength lies in an indiscriminate attitude towards means, but those in whom harmoniously developed will, reason, love, purity of thoughts, and deep life experience are combined with obvious spiritual gifts - those whom we call righteous people. Quite recently we saw an example of this: we saw the fateful hour of India and the great soul Gandhi. We saw an amazing spectacle: a man who had no state power, under whose authority there was not a single soldier, not even a personal servant, who had no roof over his head and walked in a loincloth, became the conscience, the spiritual and political leader of three hundred million people, and one of his quiet words was enough to unite these millions in a common bloodless struggle for the liberation of their country, and the shedding of the enemy's blood led to a nationwide fast and mourning. It is easy to imagine how tragically distorted the historical path of the Indian people would have been if, instead of this activist at the decisive moment, a person of a one-sided willful type had emerged as the leader, like Mussolini or Stalin, a so-called "strong personality", a master of demagogy and political intrigue, masking his despotism with tirades about the public good! How brilliantly he would have played on the lowest instincts of the people, on their natural hatred of conquerors, on envy of the rich; what waves of fire and blood would have swept over India, flooding the islands of high ethical consciousness, which for thousands of years were strengthened and cherished by the best sons of the great nation! And what tyranny would have been erected in the end over the tortured country, using the tendency to obedience created by centuries of slavery! Gandhi directed the liberating and creative enthusiasm of the nation along a different path. Here is the first example in modern history of that force which will gradually replace the sword and the whip of state power. This force is the living trust of the people in those who have proved their moral height; this is the authority of righteousness.

I anticipate many objections. One of them is as follows: yes, this was possible in India, with its unique characteristics, four-thousand-year-old religious history, and the ethical level of its people. Other nations have different legacies, and India's experience cannot be transferred to any other country. It is true that every nation has its own legacy. And India's legacy led its people to become pioneers on this path. But almost every nation has seen dictatorships and tyrannies of various hues, diverse ideological camouflage, and each one could see the abyss into which blind power, unenlightened righteousness, and not even meeting the demands of the average moral level, were leading the country. And yet, state leadership is a feat, and the average moral level is too small for that. Many peoples have seen this too because where instead of dictators, political parties alternate, there diplomats and generals, bosses and lawyers, demagogues and businessmen change, some are more selfish, others more ideological, but none can breathe new, pure, and fervent spirit into life, or solve urgent national problems. Nobody can trust any of them more than themselves because none of them even thought about what righteousness and spirituality is. These are wandering shadows, fallen leaves caught by the winds of history. If the Rose of the World does not come onto the world stage in time, they will be scattered by the fiery breath of willful and ruthless dictatorships. But if the Rose of the World appears, they will dissolve, melt under the rising sun of the great idea because people's hearts trust one righteous person more than a hundred contemporary politicians. But even more powerful and brighter will be the impact on the people and their destiny if the three highest gifts - righteousness, the gift of religious preaching, and artistic genius - are combined in one person.

Many, oh so many manifestations of religion relate entirely to its past stages. One such manifestation, apparently, is the power over the minds of strictly defined, apodictic, undeveloped, statuary dogmas. The experience of the last centuries and the growth of personality have led to the fact that man feels the conditionality and narrowness of any dogmatism. Therefore, no matter how un-dogmatic the theses of the Rose of the World may be, no matter how permeated with the spirit of religious dynamics they are, many will still struggle to accept them. But many, many will respond to its call, as long as it is addressed not so much to the intellect as to the heart, sounding in the genius creations of words, music, theater, architecture. Artistic images are more vivid and multi-aspectual than the aphorisms of theosophy or philosophical reasoning. They leave more freedom to the imagination, they allow each person to interpret the doctrine in a way that is more organic and understandable for their individuality. Revelation flows along many channels, and art - if not the purest, then the broadest of them. Therefore, all kinds of art and the beautiful cult will dress the Rose of the World in sounding and shining covers. And that is why the most natural leader of the Rose of the World is the one who has combined three greatest gifts: the gift of religious preaching, the gift of righteousness, and the gift of artistic genius. Perhaps such a person will not come or will not come soon. Perhaps the Rose of the World will be led not by him, but by a collective of the most worthy. But if Providence directed such a great soul to our century - and It already has - and the demonic forces could not eliminate it, it would be the greatest happiness for the whole earth. Because no one can have a more powerful and luminous influence on humanity than the influence of a genius word artist who has become a spiritual leader and righteous person and has been raised to the heights of world leadership by social and cultural achievements. It is only such a person who can be entrusted with the extraordinary and unprecedented task in history: ethical control over all the states of the Federation and the leadership of the peoples on the path of transforming these states into a universal brotherhood.

Oh, we Russians have paid a heavy price for our unconditional trust in a strong person, who many of us have taken for a benefactor of humanity. Let us not repeat this mistake! There are unmistakable signs that distinguish a person worthy of such a mission from an evil genius of the nation. The latter is gloomy, while the former is joyful in spiritual merriment. One strengthens their power through executions and punishments, while the other will never seek power in their lifetime and, when they do assume it, will not spill anyone's blood. One propagates the cult of their personality, which is under their control, throughout the land; the other finds it repulsive and comical. One is inaccessible, the other is open to all. One is consumed by an insatiable thirst for life and power, and hides behind impenetrable walls of imaginary danger; the other is free from the temptations of life, and in the face of danger, they are calm because their conscience is pure and their faith unshakable. These are two antipodes, messengers of two irreconcilable principles.

Of course, in the Supreme Council, such a chosen one would only be the first among equals. They would rely on the cooperation of the multitude in everything, and their own activity would be controllable by this multitude. They could only come to this extraordinary position through a strict selection process. Such a position cannot be held by youth or even middle age, only by old age. Temptations and struggles of passions must have long been overcome. As for the election itself, it seems to me that it could only be carried out through some form of plebiscite. Moreover, during the years of the supreme mentor's rule, the Council would monitor their actions. Deviation from the path would lead to the transfer of power to a more worthy individual. In general, all issues related to this could be carefully thought out, dangers foreseen, decisions weighed carefully, and subsequently improved. But as long as the supreme mentor follows the predetermined path, they are a mystical connection between living humanity and the world above, a manifestation of the Providential will, an improver of billions, and a defender of souls. In the hands of such a person, it is not scary to combine the fullness of spiritual and civic power.

Some may say that such people appear once every five hundred years. But I will say more: personalities of this caliber, possessing a sum of these particular qualities, could not have existed in the past. Einstein could not have appeared among the Maori people of the 19th century; Dostoevsky, as we know him, would have been futile to hope to find among the subjects of Tutankhamun or Theodoric. Then he would have had a different set of qualities, and many of them would not have had the opportunity to manifest in life. Such a person, of whom I speak, even in the most prosperous era, could not have realized the gifts bestowed upon him, and contemporaries would have remained completely ignorant of his true scale and potential. The necessary conditions, apparently, are already emerging in the current era; Rose of the World will create them so that the social and cultural atmosphere ensures the chain of successors worthy of this crown to the supreme mentor.

It may also be said that even all these gifts are not enough for such extraordinary activity; one must possess a broad, sober, and practical state mind. Yes, of course. Such a performer will have to deal with thousands of diverse problems; knowledge, experience, and erudition - economic, financial, legal, and even technical - will be required. But the age of Aristotle has long passed; minds of encyclopedic coverage are unimaginable in our time. And the activity of the person I am talking about is as unthinkable in isolation from the collective mind, from the Supreme Council. The deepest minds, people seasoned in the vicissitudes of state life, specialists in all branches of knowledge will participate in it. Not encyclopedic erudition or practical economic sense will be required of the supreme mentor, but wisdom. Wisdom that understands people at first sight, that immediately finds their essence in the most complex questions, and that never turns a deaf ear to the voice of conscience. The supreme mentor must stand at such a moral height that love and trust in him would replace other methods of governance. Coercion, violence against another's will, are painful for him; he uses them only in the rarest cases.

And yet this is only one of the possible options, although, in my personal opinion, the most desirable one. It is quite possible to have a leadership of the Rose of the World, such a relationship with legislative institutions and with the government of the Federation, in which the principle of collectivity will not be limited by anything or anyone. The time to develop the constitution of the future is in the distant future, and it will be up to our happy descendants, not us, to choose one of many options. But is it not a theocracy? - I do not like the word "theocracy". Theocracy means the rule of God; to apply it to any social and state structure is absurd from the point of view of an atheist, sacrilegious from the point of view of a believer. History knows no theocracy and cannot know it. It is theocracy by the priesthood, the power of the clergy, that should be called a papal or dalai-lama church-state. And the structure I am talking about is directly opposite to any theocracy: not only does the church dissolve in the state, which has absorbed it and is dominant in its name, but also the whole conglomerate of states, and the assembly of churches gradually dissolve into the all-human brotherhood, into the inter-religious church. And it is not the highest hierarchs of the church who occupy seats in the highest bodies, legislative, executive, and controlling, but the best representatives of all peoples, all faiths, all social strata, all professions. It is not theocracy, not monarchy, not oligarchy, not republic: something new, qualitatively different from everything that has existed before. This is a world order, striving for the sanctification and enlightenment of the entire life of the world. I do not know what it will be called then, but the name is not important, the essence is. And the essence of it is the work for the sake of spiritualization of man, spiritualization of humanity, spiritualization of nature.

## Chapter 2. Attitude towards culture

Gradually, a new attitude is emerging towards everything: the existence of the Rose of the World would have no meaning if it only repeated what was said before. A new attitude towards oneself, a new understanding is literally evoked by all phenomena, from the great to the small: the cosmic process and the historical process, the world laws and the connection between different material worlds, human relationships and the paths of personality development, states and religions, the animal kingdom and the elements - in short, everything that we unite under the concept of "culture" and everything that we unite under the concept of "nature". A new attitude is emerging towards everything, but this does not mean that every old attitude is devalued or disgraced: in many cases, only such a point of view is indicated, under which different past attitudes can cease to contrast with each other, begin to complement each other and must be read as different series of aspects of one and the same or many realities. This is often applied, for example, when considering old religions and the realities behind them.

In essence, the entire book is devoted to this new attitude towards things: such a problematic is too extensive and complex to be even briefly outlined in one chapter. This chapter, "Attitude towards culture", and the next, "Attitude towards religions", are not expected to provide a detailed presentation of these topics. The new understanding of different cultural areas, different historical phenomena, different religious systems, as well as different realms of nature, saturates all twelve books of this work. The first chapters are equivalent only to an introduction. They contain a summary presentation of some basic principles, and nothing more.

The leading area of culture in our era is science. The scientific method of knowledge claims hegemony; therefore, this chapter begins with a characterization of the Rose of the World's attitude specifically towards the scientific method. It must be said bluntly and without reservation that no matter how many illusions enthusiasts of the scientific method may create on this score, it has never been, will never be, and cannot be the only method of knowledge or the only method of mastering matter. Not to mention the artistic method, with which the scientific method arrogantly and reluctantly shares its dominant position now, it should be reminded that the foundations of a methodology for knowledge and mastery of materiality have long been laid, the assimilation of which is inseparably linked to spiritual self-improvement of a person, to the enlightenment of his ethical image. Even the possibility of such historical stages when this methodology will come to some primacy looms ahead. I mean not so much discredited concepts like magic or occultism due to a number of misunderstandings, as the concept of spiritual doing. Various systems and schools of this kind exist in all highly developed religions. Developing practical techniques of willpower on the human body and external matter over the centuries and leading a person to this only after lengthy moral preparation and multifaceted skill, they have raised and continue to raise hundreds, perhaps even thousands, of people to what is called miracle-working in common parlance. This methodology, extremely laborious and provoking burning hatred from modern philistines, is distinguished by one principle that is alien to science: the principle of improving and transforming one's own being, as a result of which the physical and etheric coverings of the personality become more flexible, elastic, and more obedient instruments of will than ours. This path leads to such legendary phenomena as physical passage through objects in the three-dimensional world, movement through the air, walking on water, instantaneous overcoming of enormous distances, healing of the incurable and the blind, and finally, as the highest and extremely rare achievement, the resurrection of the dead. Here we see mastery of the laws of our materiality and subordination of the lower to the higher, which are still unknown to us. And if in the 20th century most of us manage to live our whole lives without encountering undeniable cases of such phenomena, then this does not mean that such phenomena do not exist or are fundamentally impossible, but only that the conditions of the irreligious era - cultural, social, and psychological - make it so difficult to study and absorb this methodology (especially in the West and even more so in socialist countries) that the number of such cases is reduced to a few. Some truly fateful events for humanity that took place about two thousand years ago - they will be discussed later - are to blame for the fact that involving not individuals, but multiple human beings in this path of knowledge and mastery of matter proved impossible. In the future, the psychological climate of the irreligious era increasingly hindered progress along this path. Today, mastery of this methodology is extremely difficult, and in some countries it is practically impossible. But there is no reason to believe that this path will remain slow and laborious forever: the irreligious era is not infinite, we live at its end. It is difficult to imagine anything as cumbersome, imperfect, crude, and pitiful as the achievements of modern technology compared to the achievements of the methodology I am talking about. If the same resources and incalculable human reserves that are now absorbed by the development of scientific methodology were devoted to its development and assimilation, the panorama of human life, our creativity, knowledge, social structure, and moral character would change fundamentally. The psychological climate of the era of the Rose of the World will create such favorable conditions for the development of this methodology as never before. But this is a matter of the future, and not a very close one. For now, we have to mainly use another methodology, much less perfect, not leading far, but universally dominant now.

Hence the overall attitude of the Rose of the World towards science and technology at the current historical stage. Laboriously accumulating facts, deriving from them certain regularities, without understanding their nature or direction, but mechanically mastering them and being unable to predict what inventions and social upheavals will result from their discoveries - science has long been accessible to everyone, regardless of the moral character of each individual. The results are before our eyes and over our heads. The main result is that no person on earth is guaranteed that a hydrogen bomb or some other even more stunning achievement of science will not be dropped on him and his fellow citizens at any moment by highly intelligent minds. It is therefore natural that one of the first measures of the Rose of the World after taking control of the activities of the state will be the creation of a Supreme Scientific Council - that is, such a college that will be distinguished by the inner circles of the Rose of the World. Composed of individuals combining high scientific authority with high moral character, the Council will take control of all scientific and technical activities, directing its work along two paths: planning and safeguarding.

Everything related to safeguarding the interests of humanity is generally clear enough, at least in its principles, and there is hardly any need to dwell on this here. As for the problems associated with safeguarding the interests of the animal and plant kingdoms, they will be illuminated in the corresponding sections of the book devoted to the animal world and the worlds of the elementals. Because this is perhaps the only area where the views of the Rose of the World and the views of most contemporary scientists cannot be reconciled. However, this contradiction does not affect any conclusions of science, but only some of its specific practical methods, which are not only incompatible with the eyes of the Rose of the World, but also in the eyes of almost any religious-moral teaching and even almost any humane person's elementary requirements for good.

Apart from these purely methodological contradictions, there are no points of collision between the Rose of the World and science, and there cannot be. They have nowhere to collide. They are about different things. Perhaps it is not accidental that the majority of the great scientists of the 20th century were able to possess personal religiosity without hindering their scientific erudition, without preventing them from sharing and even creating bright spiritualistic systems of philosophy. Einstein and Planck, Pavlov and Lemaitre, Eddington and Milne, whatever the areas of their scientific research, remained deeply believing individuals in their own way. Of course, I am not taking into account the Soviet period Russian scientists, some of whom were forced to declare their materialism not for philosophical reasons, but for reasons understandable to everyone else. Let us leave philosophy and politics alone: in purely scientific areas, the Rose of the World does not assert anything that science has the right to deny. What is apparent is that science is silent on the realities that the Rose of the World asserts. But this is a temporary phenomenon. As for the social, cultural, and ethical problems that the Rose of the World will strive to solve, it is impossible to imagine that they will be met with any substantive objections from scientific authorities.

It is thought that the idea of planning science will no longer be the subject of discussion, but rather the boundaries of what is covered by planning and its practice. Special study of the practice of planning and coordinating scientific work in some states in the mid-20th century will probably not be without interest. However, only individual details can be used, if only because the Federation will consist of many states, large and small, just united, standing at different stages of economic development, formed in the midst of different cultures and possessing different socio-political systems. Some of these systems, which differ in greater socialization of economic relations, will be more easily involved in the general inevitable process of world socialization; others, accustomed to the anarchy of production, will be gradually drawn into it. All this, as well as the diversity of cultural types, will create an extraordinary diversity in the world economy in the first period and different cultural systems that are inactive towards each other. National antagonisms will still be felt for a long time. It will not be possible to balance and coordinate the needs of individual countries and individual segments of the population interested, for example, in the priority development of certain industries here and there or in the sale of their products somewhere else, immediately. Those who will lead the Scientific Council and the Rose of Peace will require a new psychological quality for a fair solution to these problems: overcoming in themselves the dominance of local, still natural, cultural and racial ties, complete national impartiality. How much effort, what authority and even self-sacrifice will be required, at least to weaken outdated antagonisms - Anglo-Arab, for example, Russo-Polish or Armenian-Turkish! What behavior will Germans, Englishmen, Russians, or Americans deserve to forget the enmity they have aroused in so many nations? What educational means will be required to destroy the complex of suppressed self-esteem that prevents many small and medium-sized nations from being friendly to their neighbors and turns into aggressive dreams of achieving their own greatness at the expense of the greatness of others? But this is only one side of the task. Many Western nations will have to eradicate the slightest traces of the ancient sense of superiority over others in themselves. The Russian will have to understand that his country is not the crown of creation and certainly not better than many others. The Englishman will be forced to do titanic internal work to detach himself from the involuntary preference of the interests of the inhabitants of the British Isles over the interests of the inhabitants of Indonesia or Tanganyika. The French will need to learn to embrace the interests of Paraguay or Thailand as passionately as their own. The Chinese or Arab will free their hearts and minds from centuries-old, once-justified but now outdated mistrust of Europeans and learn to pay attention to the needs of Belgium or Greece no less than the needs of Zhejiang or Sudan. Latin American residents will have to unlearn the habit of caring and complaining only about themselves and participate in the distribution of global goods, taking into account the needs of Afghanistan, Cambodia, and even Yakutia. And citizens of the United States must remember that they are Christians and that Christianity is incompatible with bestial hatred of any race, even if it is black. It is difficult, very difficult - it is clear that it is terribly difficult, but getting rid of wars and tyrannies can only be achieved through this psychological self-transformation. And, of course, no one who has not completed such an operation can hope to participate in the work of global planning organizations. It will even be necessary to learn national self-sacrifice - not with one's own blood, of course, not with the lives of one's sons, but only with dollars. For the most affluent countries, it will be necessary to share their resources with the peoples of the East and South to some extent and share it selflessly, without any hope of making this assistance a successful business. In short, everyone involved in the leadership of the Rose of the World must first feel like a member of the cosmic whole, then a member of humanity, and only after all of this - a member of their nation. And not the other way around, as we have been taught so far. 

Because the ultimate goal of the Rose of the World, or rather, of the gigantic spiritual process that began millennia ago and of which the Rose of the World is only a stage, is enlightenment of Shambhala. The immediate task of this epoch is to establish material prosperity, simple well-being, and elementary moral relations between people everywhere, leaving no one beyond its reach. The thesis that all people without exception should be provided with work, rest, leisure, a peaceful old age, cultural housing, the enjoyment of all democratic freedoms, and the satisfaction of basic material and spiritual needs, will begin to be rapidly realized. Only in the last chapters will I be able to shed light on the concrete measures, the system of sequential reforms, thanks to which, as I see it, these principles can be embodied in flesh and blood. For now, it's only about the principles. Those who do not sympathize with these principles should not waste their time and energy reading further, while those who sympathize should understand the inner spirit of the Rose of the World before turning to reflection on the ways of realizing these ideals in life.

This is the principle of the Rose of the World's attitude towards science and technology, as far as it can be conveyed without delving into meta-historical and trans-physical depths. And this should be the role of the scientific method in the series of immediate epochs.

Several decades will pass. The progressive growth of productive forces will reach a level that we will be able to call universal prosperity. The living conditions that citizens of advanced countries enjoy now will be established in the most remote corners of the globe. The allocation of the immense sums of money that are now spent on armaments for peaceful purposes will give economic progress almost unimaginable momentum. The period of universal primary education will probably be overcome in all countries even earlier, and in the future, even universal secondary education will begin to appear insufficient. The outlines of the intelligentsia will coincide with the outlines of humanity. The development of new means of communication, their accessibility, and their comfort will practically eliminate the problem of international and intercultural space. The working day, decreasing more and more, will release new reserves of time. Physiology will develop equipment to help the human brain quickly and firmly memorize the information it receives. Leisure time will increase. And the questions that most people are concerned about now - the interests of the economy, the organization of production, the improvement of products, industrial technology, and the further improvement of living facilities - will lose their urgency. It is even quite likely that those generations will not understand and will find it strange how their predecessors could be so engrossed and agitated about such boring and flat problems. The reserves of energy will be turned towards creating higher-order values because the material basis of life will be immune to any fluctuations, comprehensive, and completely stable.

Technical and economic problems will no longer attract primary attention. They will be addressed within the appropriate collectives, and their publicity will be no greater than that given to issues of public kitchens or water supply, and human talent will turn to something else: to what will be dictated by thirst for knowledge, love for all living things, the need for higher forms of creativity, and a passion for beauty.

The thirst for knowledge, once driving explorers to navigate unknown seas, to wander through uncharted continents, will first propel them, possibly even before the advent of the Rose of the World, into space travel. But foreign planets are inhospitable; after a few reconnaissance expeditions, these flights will stop. And the thirst for knowledge itself will begin to change its direction. Systems will be developed for educating and unleashing in the human being the potentially inherent spiritual organs of sight, spiritual hearing, deep memory, and the ability to voluntarily separate the internal, immaterial structures of the human being from his physical body. Journeys will begin to immaterial worlds, to the opening layers of Shadanakar. It will be the era of Magellans of planetary space, and Columbuses of spirit.

What system of views on personality, its value, its rights and duties, on the path of its improvement will contribute to the establishment of a new psychological climate and hasten the advent of this golden age?

It is precisely in the fact that personality contains innate abilities for creativity and love with the divine that its absolute value is enclosed. Its relative value depends on the stage of its ascending path, on the sum of efforts - its own and Providential - expended on achieving this stage, and on the extent to which it reveals these abilities of god-making and love in life.

The earthly segment of the ascending monad's cosmic path is a stage at which its abilities for creativity and love can and should be extended to its natural and artificial environment, improving it by overcoming the tendency towards isolated self-assertion of its parts and particles at the expense of others. Evil is rooted in this tendency, no matter how it manifests itself. Its forms and scales are diverse almost to infinity, but the basis is always the same: the desire to assert oneself at the expense of others and everything else.

Ancient religions saw the relative value of a person in the degree to which they fulfilled the prescriptions of a given religious and moral code. Ascetic religions regarded sanctity as the highest level, understanding it as the purest example of monastic service or martyrdom for faith. At the same time, love took a back seat. Monastic or martyric feat was performed not out of love for people and all living beings, but out of the thirst for reunification with God and liberation from posthumous torment. Of course, I mean here the dominant direction, prevailing mood, and not the images of such amazing individual actors, apostles of love, like St. Francis, Ramajuana, or Milarepa. However monstrous it may seem to us, even the eternal torment of sinners in hell did not evoke in the majority of adherents of these religions a desire to enlighten the world's laws, including the law of retribution or karma. Eternal retribution for temporary violation of their laws seemed to them a fair act of the Deity or, in any case (as in Brahmanism), an indisputable and absolutely insurmountable law. Buddha burned with the flame of compassion like a candle, but he too taught only how to break out of the circle of the iron laws of the world, not how to enlighten and transform them. As for creativity, its innate nature was not recognized by the monad at all, not even the concept of it existed, and specific types of creativity available to humans were not considered valuable, except for religious creativity in a narrow sense: spiritual work, theology, preaching, temple construction, culture.

Other religions, not inclined towards asceticism, such as Islam and Protestantism, modified this ideal, expanding it and at the same time lowering it, making it more accessible, more popular, even to the point of fulfilling several commandments regarding God, the state, the immediate environment, the family, and finally, oneself. It must be repeated that neither group of religions set the task of transforming society, let alone nature, before anyone. Accordingly, the concept of the obligation of the individual remained stunted and narrow. Naturally, such tasks, but in an extremely simplified form, were finally set by irreligious teachings. A reduced and contradictory ethical ideal was proclaimed, mechanically combining some progressive features with those that went against the ethical minimum, which had long seemed indisputable. The old formula "the end justifies the means" was recalled and, fearing to proclaim it with honest frankness, it was practically used. When characterizing and evaluating historical phenomena, their moral quality was completely ignored; verdicts were rendered only based on the consideration of the overall progressive or reactionary direction of the given phenomenon. No one was disturbed by the fact that this led to the justification of the bloody activities of many despots of the past and even such blatant mass massacres as the Jacobin terror or the activity of the Oprichnina. Many old achievements of social progress, such as freedom of speech, the press, or religious propaganda, were discarded. Generations raised in such an atmosphere gradually lost the very need for these freedoms - a symptom that speaks more eloquently than any tirade about the stunning spiritual regression of society. Thus, as the ideal approached in the form in which it was presented in reality, even the positive that it contained was devalued. For ahead, only the kingdom of material satiety was painted, bought at the price of renouncing spiritual freedom, with multimillion human lives sacrificed and billions of souls relegated to the lower layers of Shadanakar, who gave up their divine primogeniture for a bowl of lentil soup.

One should hope that the terrible lesson will not be in vain.

The teachings of the Rose of the World point to the absolute value of the individual, to their divine primacy: the right to be free from the burden of poverty, from the burden of aggressive societies, to well-being, to all kinds of free creativity and to the publication of this creativity, to religious pursuits, to beauty. The right of human beings to a secure existence and the use of the benefits of civilization is an inherent right that does not require giving up either freedom or spirituality. To assert that there is some fatal dilemma here, that in order to achieve all natural, self-evident goods, one must sacrifice personal spiritual and social freedom, is to deceive people.

The doctrine also points to the obligations of the individual: the consistent expansion of the sphere of what is encompassed by their love, the growth, multiplication, and enlightenment of what is created by their creativity. Creativity thus becomes both a right and a duty. To this day, I cannot understand how this truly divine human ability did not receive proper recognition in any of the ancient religions, except for some forms of polytheism, especially Hellenic. It seems that only in Greece were people able to deify not only works of art, but the very creative ability itself, specifically creative, and not productive, as in other forms of polytheism, and even to crown great artists with apotheoses. It is sad and strange that after the decline of Greece, the gift of creativity ceased to attract the attention of religions and was no longer understood ontologically, metaphysically, or mystically. Under the influence of a one-sided understanding of the Semitic idea that after six days of creation, the Divine creative spirit rested, even the question of further divine creativity was preferred to be avoided by theological thought, and the speech of God, recorded in the Revelation of John - "Behold, I make all things new" - remained a singular ascent, a singular insight. Human creativity, however, was viewed with suspicion, as if the pride that a human creator could fall into was more dangerous and fatal than creative infertility. Unfortunately, no less regrettable is the view of human creativity that has been established in religions of Indian origin.

In the past centuries, Western culture, with its rich manifestations of genius in all areas of art, science, philosophy, has taught us many things. They taught us to have a reverential attitude towards human creativity and to respect human labor. However, the irreligious spirit of these centuries contributed to what the ancient religions feared: pride in one's creative talent became inherent to the human creator, as if he had created this gift within himself. Nevertheless, this self-sufficiency nested itself not so much in the souls of genuine geniuses, let alone spiritual messengers, but among the ranks of secondary figures in science and the arts. A more detailed consideration of these problems from the perspective of the teaching of the Rose of the World will be the subject of a series of special chapters in this book.

In any case, creativity, like love, is not an exclusive gift known only to the chosen ones. The chosen ones know righteousness and holiness, heroism and wisdom, genius and talent. But this is only the disclosure of potentials inherent in every soul. The depths of love and inexhaustible springs of creativity boil beyond the threshold of consciousness of each of us. The religion of the end will strive to destroy this barrier, to let the living waters break through here, into life. In generations raised by it, a creative attitude towards everything will be revealed, and even labor will not be a burden, but a manifestation of an insatiable thirst to create something new, to create the best, to create their own. All followers of the Rose of the World will enjoy creative work, teaching this joy to their children and youth. To create in everything: in word and town planning, in exact sciences and horticulture, in the adornment of life and in its softening, in worship and in the art of mysteries, in the love of men and women, in the nurturing of children, in the development of the human body and in dance, in the enlightenment of nature and in play.

Because all creativity, except for demonic creativity done in one's own name and for oneself, is an act of divinity. Through it, humans elevate themselves above themselves, worshiping not only their own hearts but also the hearts of others.

In terms of personal spiritual development, most people follow a slow and broad path. This path passes through marriage and childbearing, various forms of activity, the fullness and diversity of life experiences, its joys and pleasures. But there is also the Narrow Path, which belongs to those who have a special gift in their soul that requires strict self-restraint: the gift of holiness. Religious teachings that assert the Narrow Path as the only correct or highest path are unjust. Similarly, social or religious systems that deny it altogether and erect obstacles before those who feel called to such a path are also wrong. In the era of the Rose of the World, monasteries are unlikely to be numerous, but they will exist so that anyone whose spiritual thirst drives them to the Narrow Path can work on developing such soul abilities that require years of work in silence and seclusion. If a person embarks on the Narrow Path out of fear of retribution or because of a dream of personal, self-absorbed, closed communication with the Divine, their victories are worthless. There is no deity who rewards their faithful servants with the blissful contemplation of their greatness. The contemplation of the highest spheres is the way for the individual to exit themselves and join the One that encompasses all monads and creates the entire world. Therefore, a follower of the Rose of the World can be compelled to embark on the Narrow Path not by spiritual egoism or a thirst for personal salvation with cold indifference to others, but by an understanding that such gifts are revealed on the Narrow Path, with which the righteous will help the world more effectively from seclusion than hundreds of people living in the world, and which, after death, become such a force that even mighty demonic hierarchies bow before it.

There is no need for scary oaths accompanying the initiation ceremony. There is no basis for condemning or reviling someone who has strayed from the path after a number of years. The initiate will first take only a temporary vow: for three years, five, or seven. Only after successfully completing such stages will they, if they wish, be granted the right to take a vow for a longer period of time; and yet the awareness of irreversibility, the suspicion of an irreparable mistake, will not torment and crush them, giving rise to despair and violent outbursts of unfulfilled desires: they will know that at the end of the term they are free to return to the world, free to choose any way of life, any work, free to have a family and children, without deserving condemnation or contempt from anyone.

I have tried to anticipate the attitude of the Rose of the World towards scientific and non-scientific methods of cognition, towards personality, its rights and obligations, towards human creativity and work, and now towards the two main types of spiritual path: Broad and Narrow. To supplement the representation of her attitude towards culture, it would be necessary to dwell on her views on art - in the broadest sense of the word. But this question is so ambiguous and important, and personally so close to me, that I have decided to dedicate a series of chapters to it in one of the further parts of the book. Therefore, before moving on to the question of the Rose of the World's attitude towards other religions, I will only say a few fleeting words about the arts of the approaching era.

What are the characteristics of the art that people who are associated with the spirit of the Rose of the World will create in the coming epochs, when the sun of the golden age is only beginning to illuminate the clouds on the horizon?

It would be naive to try to predict or outline the diversity of artistic movements, genres, schools, and stylistic techniques that will emerge in this sphere of culture by the end of this century. However, it seems to me that a certain predominant style will be defined, which will not exhaust all the currents of art (in conditions of maximum freedom, this is impossible, and not necessary for the same reason), but is destined to become a kind of "mainstream" in art and literature in the last third of the century. In this style, Rose Mira's inherent perception of things will find its expression: a perception that sees through layers of physical reality to other immaterial or spiritual layers. Such a worldview will be far from intentional optimism, afraid to disturb its own tranquility by paying attention to the dark and tragic sides of existence. The creators of this art will not avoid contemplating the mournful and terrible underside of the world. They would consider it cowardly to want to forget about the bloody path of history, about the reality of the ominous, infra-physical layers of Shadanakar, about their merciless laws, which hold in bondage the inhuman torments of countless unhappy beings, and about the most frightening outbursts of the human spirit, which are prepared by the forces of the Antigod and will almost inevitably come to pass in history when the golden age has exhausted its forward movement. However, a high degree of awareness will not hinder their love for the world, for the earth, and will not diminish their joys, born of nature, culture, creativity, social service, love, friendship - on the contrary! Does awareness of hidden dangers that threaten those you love weaken the passion of love? There will be wonderful creations of unprecedented completeness of life affirmation, purity, and joy. In the streams of all the arts - those that already exist and those that will arise - there will appear sparkling works of the creators of the future about love, more multifaceted than ours, about youth, about the joys of home and social activity, about the expansion of human consciousness, about the widening of the boundaries of perception, about the elements that have become friendly with humans, about the daily proximity of as-yet-invisible friends of our hearts, and about many other things that will excite the people of those epochs, and that we cannot even imagine.

It seems to me that such an art, brave in its fearlessness and feminine in its love, is a wise combination of joy and tenderness towards people and the world, with a keen understanding of its dark depths. It could be called permeating realism or meta-realism. And should we even say that a work of art necessarily needs to be an example of permeating realism for people who are connected to the spirit of the Rose of the World to be able to enjoy and admire it? They will enjoy everything that is marked by talent and at least one of these characteristics: a sense of beauty, a wide range of coverage, depth of thought, sharpness of eye, purity of heart, and joy of soul.

There will come a time when the ethical and aesthetic level of society and of the artists themselves will be such that there will be no need for any restrictions, and the freedom of art, literature, philosophy, and science will be complete. But between the moment when the Rose of the World takes control of the states and the era of this ideal level, several decades will pass. The idea might arise not from wisdom but from youthful immaturity that society has already reached the heights of development where absolute freedom cannot generate fatal, irreversible abuses. Initially, it will be necessary to entrust the local branches of the World Art Council, among other more encouraging functions, with this one control, through which the artistic work will pass before it is made public. This will be - if the reader will excuse the pun - the swan song of censorship. At first, when national antagonisms and racial prejudices have not yet been eliminated and aggressive organizations still play on these prejudices, a ban will have to be imposed on any propaganda of hatred between certain population groups. Later, control will still be maintained over books and textbooks popularizing scientific and philosophical ideas, but only to prevent them from being incomplete, lightweight, or distorting objective facts, and not to mislead unqualified readers. I think that control over artistic works will still be maintained, requiring them to have a certain minimum amount of artistic merit and protecting the book market from being flooded with tasteless, aesthetically illiterate rubbish. And finally, the unconditional ban on pornography will probably be the most persistent. With the abolition of each of these restrictions, another measure will replace it: after the release of a substandard work, the World Art Council or World Scientific Council will publish their authoritative judgment on it. That will be enough. Of course, it will not be easy to develop a system for filling seats in these councils that would guarantee all areas of culture against the intervention of people with narrow partisan or narrow school views, intolerant supporters of any one artistic trend or philosophical concept, or defenders of the creative interests of a limited group, nation, or generation. However, I do not think that in the psychological atmosphere of the Rose of the World.

If we don't delve into the distinction between the concepts of culture and civilization, we can say that culture is nothing but the collective creativity of humanity. And if creativity is the highest, most precious, and sacred ability of human beings, a manifestation of their divine spirit, then there is nothing more precious and sacred on earth than culture, especially the more spiritual the cultural layer, cultural area, or cultural creation.

Humanity's universal culture is still emerging; so far, we have only seen fully formed cultures of individual super-national groups, i.e., groups of nations united by a jointly created, unique culture. But each of these cultures is by no means exhausted by the sphere that exists, develops, and occupies our three-dimensional space. Those who created this culture here continue their creativity even after death - creativity that has changed, of course, to suit the conditions of the world or worlds through which the soul of the creator now passes. The idea arises of millions of such souls in community, of heavenly countries and cities over each of the super-national groups of the world, and of Arimoye, the emerging heavenly country of universal culture.

This principle of relating to culture is new and unusual. We could even note that, with further deepening and detailing, it will grow into an extensive myth if we do not understand the word "myth" as something without any reality. Here, on the contrary, we are talking about the reality of colossal proportions, which is reflected obscurely, but still reflected, in such a myth.

The atmosphere of the Rose of the World and its teachings will create conditions for the myth of culture to become accessible to every mind. And even though only a limited number of consciousnesses can grasp its esoteric complexity, the spirit of this concept, rather than its letter, will gradually become available to almost everyone. And if one delves into the psychological perspectives that the acquisition of such a concept promises from the masses' side, the hope for creating a system of measures that guarantees all areas of culture from the intervention of people who have no internal rights to lead these areas will no longer seem unattainable.

## Chapter 3. Attitude towards religions

How often do we use the word "truth" and how rarely do we try to define this concept? Let us not be confused, however, by repeating Pilate's question, and let us try to understand this concept to the best of our ability.

We call theories or doctrines true if, in our view, they express an undistorted representation of some object of knowledge. In the precise sense of the word, truth is an undistorted reflection of some object of knowledge in our mind, and as many objects of knowledge exist in the world, so too can there be many truths.

But objects of knowledge are known to us, not in and of themselves. Therefore, the truth about any object of knowledge known to us must be recognized as relative truth. Absolute truth, on the other hand, is a reflection of an object of knowledge that has been perceived "in itself" by some subject of knowledge. This kind of knowledge is fundamentally possible only when the opposition between the object and the subject is eliminated; when the subject of knowledge identifies with the object.

Absolute truth, as a universal truth, is an undistorted reflection of the great universe perceived "in itself" by someone's consciousness. Private absolute truths are undistorted reflections of some part of the universe, a part that has been perceived "in itself".

Naturally, the absolute truth of the great universe can arise only in the consciousness of a subject of knowledge comparable to it, a subject of omniscience capable of identifying with the object, capable of knowing things not only "from itself," but also "in itself." Such a subject of knowledge is called the Absolute, God, the Sun of the world.

God "in himself," as an object of knowledge, is known only by himself. His absolute truth, like the absolute truth of the universe, is accessible only to him.

It is clear that any particular truth, no matter how small the object of knowledge may be, is only accessible to us in its relative form. However, this agnosticism should not be understood as absolute: when any private subject of knowledge coincides, any monad with a subject, absolute knowledge of not only "from oneself" but also "in itself" becomes possible. Thus, a conditional agnosticism is legitimate, not an absolute one.

Private truths may have several or many variants - personal, individual varieties of one particular relative truth. In this case, objects of knowledge of small (compared to the subject) scales will be reflected in the consciousness of a series of related subjects almost or completely identically: it is precisely the relatedness of many subjects among themselves that conditions the fact that their personal variants of a certain truth are also related. If this were not the case, people would be unable to understand each other in anything. However, the larger the object of knowledge compared to the subject, the more variants it evokes. The relative truth of the Universe and the relative truth of the Deity produce as many personal variants as there are perceiving subjects.

It is clear, therefore, that all our "truths" are, strictly speaking, only approximations to the truth. And the smaller the object of knowledge, the better it can be grasped by our knowledge, the smaller the gap between its absolute truth and our relative truth about it. However, there is a limit to the relationship between the scale of the subject and the object below which the gap between absolute and relative truth begins to increase again. For example, the gap between the absolute truth of some elementary particle and our relative truth about it is extremely large. However, between the Absolute truth of the Universe, the Absolute truth of the Deity, and our relative truths about them, the gap is incomparably great.

I express thoughts that, after Kant, should, it would seem, be well-known and generally accepted. However, if they were assimilated by every religiously sensitive and religiously thinking person, no one's claims to personal or collective knowledge of the Absolute truth, no one's claims to the absolute truthfulness of any theory or doctrine, could have a place.

As shown above, Absolute Truth is only the possession of the Omniscient Subject. If any human subject were to possess such truth, for example, the collective consciousness of a specific-historical church, this would be objectively evident in the unconditional omniscience of that collective consciousness. The fact that no human collective or individual possesses such omniscience once again demonstrates the baselessness of any claim of any doctrine to absolute truth. If representatives of the Rose of the World were ever to claim absolute truth for their teaching, it would be just as baseless and foolish.

But equally baseless and foolish is the assertion that all teachings, or any one teaching, is false. There are no completely false teachings and cannot be. If an opinion were to appear devoid of even a shred of truth, it could not become a teaching, that is, a sum of ideas transmitted to someone. It would remain the property of the person who produced it, as is the case, for example, with philosophical or pseudoscientific constructions of some mentally ill individuals. Only individual particular statements can be false in the strictest sense of the word, which can create the illusion of truth borrowed from partly true theses adjacent to it in the overall system. However, there is a certain relationship between the quantity and weight of partly true and false theses, at which the sum of false ones begins to devalue the crumbs of truth contained in the teaching. Then there are teachings in which false statements not only devalue the element of truth but also turn the entire system into a category of negative spiritual values. Such teachings are commonly called "left-hand" teachings. The future teaching of the Antigod, which apparently marks the penultimate stage of world history, will be constructed in such a way that even a minimal weight of partly true elements will make the false statements appear as truthful as possible. This will result in the circumstance that this teaching will entangle human consciousness in the nets of falsehood more firmly and hopelessly than any other.

Religions that do not belong to the category of "left-hand" teachings differ from each other not in terms of the truth of one and the falsehood of the others, but along two completely different coordinates. Namely:

Firstly, due to the different levels of their ascent to absolute truth, that is, according to the decrease of subjective and epochal elements within them. This staged difference can be conditionally called a difference along the vertical.

Secondly, they differ from each other because they talk about different things and reflect different series of objects of knowledge. This type of difference - segmental differences - can be conditionally called differences along the horizontal.

Both types of differences should not be overlooked when considering the issue of the Rose of the World's attitude towards other religions.

In the development of science, we observe a continuous process of accumulating relative, partial truths and their improvement, clarification. At each stage, usually not the series of previously accumulated facts are rejected, but only their outdated interpretation. Cases where an old series of facts is questioned and rejected, as happened with alchemy, for example, are relatively rare. But in the history of religions, unfortunately, other customs prevail. Instead of successively replacing one another's spiritual insights that are not subject to doubt, we more often see how significant series of previously achieved relative and partial truths are rejected at the next stage of religious development, and our new series of them, including some old ones, is presented as absolute.

This observation is especially true with regard to the transition from so-called pagan religions to monotheistic systems.

It is clear that if we were to maintain such customs in the expanding horizons of the 20th century, we would at most create another sect. Introducing scientific methodology into religion would, of course, be a gross mistake, as illegal as transferring methods of art to the field of science. But it is high time to adopt the good practice of scientists - not to reject but to rethink the series of previously accumulated relative truths.

From what has been said, it follows that no doctrines other than those of the "left hand," recognized primarily by their spiritually disintegrating effect, can be completely rejected. They must be recognized as insufficient, burdened with subjective-human contributions: epochal, class-based, racial, individual. However, a kernel of relative truth, a kernel of knowledge "from us" of one or another area of the transphysical world, exists in each of the religions, and each such truth is precious for all of humanity. Naturally, the volume of truth in systems that have developed as a result of the experience of many individuals is usually greater than the volume of truth in systems that are only spread among small groups. Exceptions can be young systems that may rise to wide dissemination, but, as a matter of course, first pass through the stage of cellular or limited-group existence.

Such widely disseminated systems are called myths in this concept—as will be explained in more detail below. Behind myths, there is always some transphysical reality, but it cannot be free from distortion and confusion caused by the multitude of "human, all-too-human" contributions to the myth. The methodology for releasing the transphysical kernel of myths from their human shell is unlikely to be strictly and precisely formulated, at least not yet. It has not been possible to develop the necessary mechanism of criteria for this, which would be sufficient in any case. And it is doubtful whether such a complex mystical task can be solved with just one rational approach. However, one can construct a classification of religions based on the teleology of history, which would allow one to identify highly developed religions as a special group and to verify that there are theses affirmed by this group of religions, although with varying degrees of purity and strength. These include: the thesis of the unity of God, the plurality of various spiritual hierarchies, the plurality of different meanings of the worlds, the infinite plurality of becoming monads, as well as the existence of a certain common moral law, which is characterized by this or that posthumous retribution for human deeds in life. In all other respects, and even in the interpretation of the common theses just listed, myths either contradict each other or speak of different things.

However, while in many cases the individuality of the subject introduces something foreign and purely human into the representations of the knowable, on the other hand, there are just as many cases where some spiritual truth can only be perceived by a specific configuration of the knowing consciousness. Individuality turns out to be a factor that does not cloud cognition, but, on the contrary, makes it truly possible. The teleological process in the religious history of humanity partly consisted in the fact that the consciousness of a particular personality, people, race, or era was polished by the influence of historical and biographical factors in such a way as to make it capable of perceiving the truths of this transcendent reality. To other individuals, peoples, races, and eras, such polished consciousness and its religious experience may have seemed strange, distorted, or immature, fraught with all kinds of aberrations.

Of the hundreds of possible examples, I will take one very bright one for now: the idea of reincarnation. Deeply inherent in Hinduism and Buddhism, and present in esoteric Judaism (Kabbalah), this idea is rejected by Orthodox Christianity and Islam. But should we think, based on this "non-universality" of the idea, that it represents a racial or stage-cultural aberration of Indian consciousness? The point is that in coordinating the theses of different religions, one must first learn to sift the main from the secondary, the common from the particular. The "common," the main thing in any thesis, lies in the seed of the idea, which shows extraordinary stability over the centuries: thrown into the soil of different cultural environments, it gives rise to different shoots - different variations of the given thesis. If there is any teleological directionality in history at all, then, of course, this directionality must first of all be reflected in the being of such stable spiritual seeds - in the widely spread, professed by millions of consciousnesses, foundations of ideas.

The seed of the idea of reincarnation consists of the teaching about a certain Self that undergoes its cosmic development, or a known segment of it through successive existences in our physical world. Everything else, such as the spiritual-material nature and structure of the reincarnating Self, a certain dependence of reincarnations on the law of karma, the extension of the principle of reincarnation also to the animal world, or the denial of such extension - all these are just variations and modifications of the basic idea. It is clear that in these variations and details one can encounter more and more genuine aberrations than in the seed of the idea, for the perception of which the Indian people's teleological forces worked for many centuries, expending incredible effort to weaken in many of its representatives the midriff between daytime consciousness and deep memory - the repository of memories of the soul's paths up to the moment of its last incarnation. The fallacy of religious dogmas lies mostly not in their content but in the claims that the law asserted by the dogma has universal, cosmic significance, and that the fact asserted by the dogma must be professed by all humanity, for without this there is supposedly no salvation. All that has been stated leads us to the recognition of the genuineness of that spiritual experience which crystallized into the idea of reincarnation: yes, such a path of development exists; there is nothing essentially unacceptable here either in Christianity or Islam in the essence of this idea, except, perhaps, that no statements by the founders of Christianity or Islam have reached us regarding the idea of reincarnation (which, however, does not prove anything in itself, since it is well known that not everything they said has made its way into the Gospels and the Qur'an). But it does not follow at all that the path of reincarnation is supposedly the only possible, the only real path of the individual spirit's development. The consciousness of the Indian people, polished in this direction to comprehend this type of path, as often happens in such cases, absolutized its discovery, becoming deaf to the perception of other types of paths of development. The same thing happened with the Jewish and Arab peoples, but under the opposite sign: having perceived the truth about another type of development path, in which incarnation in the physical layer takes place only once, the consciousness of these peoples just as unjustifiably absolutized this second type of path. This is also facilitated by the fact that in different metacultures of humanity, one or another type may generally prevail. As a result, there arose between the two groups of world religions a divergence. In reality, both of these antagonistic ideas are true in their essence, fixing two possible types of paths, and to resolve this "contradiction" nothing is required except for each side to abandon claims of universal exclusivity for their idea.

So, one of the historical reasons for the alleged irreconcilable contradictions between religions lies in the illegitimate absolutization of any thesis.

Here is another reason. One of the main dogmas of Christianity, as is known, is the teaching of the Trinity of the Godhead. The founder of Islam rejected this dogma, suspecting in it a reminiscence of polytheism, and more importantly, because his own spiritual experience did not contain a positive indication of such a truth. But in the 20th century, it is hardly worth repeating the arguments of Christian theologians who once proved and explained the fundamental difference between the dogma of the Trinity and polytheism: it is so elementary that, one would assume, even among Muslim thinkers, there will be no one who, understanding the questions of Christian doctrine, would insist on this erroneous statement. As for the second argument - that Muhammad's spiritual experience did not contain confirmation of the Trinity - it is logically flawed. No one's experience can contain confirmation of all true ideas that arose earlier in the course of collective human understanding of God and the world. Every personal experience is limited, and only the wisdom of the Omniscient (which encompasses the sum of truths "in itself" over the ages) can comprehend them all. Therefore, the fact that Muhammad did not experience anything that confirms the thesis of the Trinity itself should not serve as an argument for refuting this idea, even in the eyes of orthodox Muslims. Instead of the formula "The Prophet, having known the perfect unity of God, became convinced of the falsehood of the teaching of the Trinity," it should be formulated, fairly, as follows: "The Prophet, having known the perfect unity of God, did not, however, receive indications of the Trinity of the One." It is entirely natural that Christian doctrine not only has no objections to the Muslim teaching of Unity but fully coincides with it. It only supplements this thesis with an idea that, with its stability for two thousand years and its prevalence in billions of minds, points to the truth of its foundation. What does the contradiction between these two main dogmas of two religions boil down to? Isn't it just arbitrary and illegitimate denial of one of them of what it has no data on in its own positive experience?

Now we see the second historical and psychological reason for the entrenched disagreements between religious doctrines: the unjustified denial of someone else's statement only on the basis that we do not have positive data on this issue.

Unfortunately, there are countless disagreements based solely on this logical and epistemological inconsistency. Let's consider another case known to everyone: Islam (Sunni) and Protestantism deny the legitimacy of the cult of saints, while almost all other religions accept and implement it in one form or another. The objections to this cult boil down to the idea that man does not need any intermediaries between himself and the deity, and that spiritual honors and prayers, when offered not to God, but to those who were mere humans, are sinful because they lead to the deification of man. But what does this famous formula actually mean: "Man does not need intermediaries"? If the person proclaiming this idea does not need them, then where does he get the right to speak for others, even for all of humanity? Who authorized him? Was it not the billions of people who, in almost all countries and religions, felt a living daily need for such intermediaries, which made the existence of the cult of saints psychologically possible? If we, without experiencing a need for something (there are people, for example, who do not feel the need for music), start to condemn those who do, as foolish fabricators, selfish liars, or dark ignoramuses, what will we prove by this, other than our own ignorance? The second argument is the illegitimacy of giving divine honors and prayers to those who were mere humans. But divine honors (in the monotheistic sense) are not given to them, and no one equates them with God; this idea is completely absurd, and for people who grew up in Christian countries, it is unforgivably ignorant. True, in Hinduism there is the idea of avatars - incarnations of Vishnu in human form; but they are avatars, not saints. People bow before the saints just as they would before those who have managed to overcome their human nature or before the executors of God's will, messengers of the higher world. Protestantism denies the concept of holiness altogether. However, this seems to be more of a dispute about particulars rather than the substance of the matter: after all, by rejecting the ascetic monastic ideal, Luther and Calvin did not diminish the value of worldly righteousness, although they understood it more broadly than Catholicism and somewhat prohibited their followers from turning to his spirit in prayer. This demonstrates the purity and sincerity of their thoughts, but contradicts the foundations of religious and moral worldview in general. For if righteousness, as the highest self-sacrifice for humanity in the name of God, is perfect and selfless service to Him (and if righteousness is understood in this way, then it is ridiculous to deny that it exists in the world, although it is rare in life), then it is impossible to imagine a righteous soul that after death settles into inactive bliss. With all the strength of their soul, including those that are revealed only after death, the righteous will provide help to those who are alive and below in their ascending movement. This is as natural as helping an adult child, and just as little, as this help diminishes or belittles those to whom it is directed. It is unlikely that Prophet Muhammad was unaware of this. It is to be assumed that some extremes, excesses in the cult of saints that he observed among Christians, prompted him to forbid his followers from making any such establishments. Perhaps he believed that this prohibition was balanced by the fact that deceased righteous people do not necessarily need to be reminded by the praying to provide them with invisible help. Anyway, any doctrine that affirms the truth of spiritual immortality and high moral law can only illogically assume that the spirit of the righteous in his posthumous life relates to the living inactivity and apathy. The denial of the cult of saints, or rather the righteous, is logical only from one point of view: materialistic. However, on the other hand, absolutizing the cult of saints as universally binding is equally illegitimate. There are long stages in the path of the soul, even in the path of a whole nation, when they really do not need any "mediators"; when the soul, consciously or unconsciously, feels that strengthening its independence, strength, freedom, spiritual will excludes the possibility of turning to anyone for help other than God Himself. What basis and by what right will we impose participation in the cult of saints on such a person?

The main contradiction between Christianity and other religions is the assertion of the divinity of Jesus Christ as a dogma and the worship of Him as the incarnation of one of the hypostases of the Trinity. It is well known that other religions either agree to recognize Jesus as a prophet among other prophets or ignore Him, sometimes even vigorously denying His providential mission. Christianity, on the other hand, relying on the words of its Founder that no one comes to the Father except through the Son, denies the possibility of salvation for all non-Christians.

However, it seems that we will avoid many misunderstandings and crude reductions of ideas if we try to understand all the sayings of Christ that have come down to us by asking ourselves the question: did Jesus speak in this case as a person, as a concrete historical figure who lived in such-and-such a country from such-and-such a date, or is His mind and mouth transformed into human words by the voice of God, which He hears within Himself? Each statement of Christ requires consideration precisely from this angle: is He speaking in this case as a Messenger of the truth of the spiritual world or as a human being?

For it cannot be imagined that Jesus spoke only as a Messenger at all moments of His life and never as a human being. It is unlikely that there is any doubt that in His mournful cry on the cross, "My God, My God, why have You forsaken Me?", the anguish of one of those moments when He, Jesus, as a human being, experienced the tragedy of abandonment, the tragedy of interrupting the connection of His human Self with the Divine Spirit. And in His teaching, expounded at the Last Supper, one can always hear, instead of the first-person pronoun, the God-Son, the World Logos.

All of His words preserved in the Gospel should be subjected to such a division of Christ's speech into two groups. It is absolutely clear in this case that His words about no one coming to the Father except through the Son should be understood not in the reduced, narrowed, confined, and merciless sense that supposedly no human soul will be saved except for Christians, but in the magnificent, truly spiritual, cosmic sense that every monad, having replenished itself to the end, plunges into the depths of God the Son, the Heart and Demiurge of the universe, and only through this all-completing act returns to its source, to God the Father, incomprehensibly identifying itself with Him and with the entire Holy Trinity.

One of the prominent figures of the religious and philosophical Indian community, Brahmo Samaj, Keshub Chander-Sen, expressed a very profound thought: he said that the wisdom of the Hindus, the meekness of the Buddhists, and the courage of the Muslims all come from Christ. Obviously, in this case, he understood by this name, not the historical personality of Jesus, but the Logos, which is predominantly but not exclusively expressed in Jesus Christ. In this idea, I see a way to a viewpoint that could lead to understanding between Christians and many schools of Eastern religiosity.

It also seems that some expressions that have taken root in Christian theology, which we repeat almost mechanically and which are precisely unacceptable to other faiths, need to be reviewed and clarified. For example, how should we understand the term "incarnation" in reference to Jesus Christ? Do we still imagine that the Logos of the universe was clothed with this particular human flesh? Can we assume that through teleological preparation, a bodily instrument, an individual physical organism, a human brain capable of accommodating the Mind of the Universe, was created from generation to generation? If so, then we must assume that Jesus already possessed omniscience during his lifetime, which is not even consistent with the facts of the gospel story and his own words. Is this disproportion of cosmic and local-planetary, narrow-human categories unbearable for us? Is it unbearable not because it exceeds the limits of our understanding but because it is too obvious that it is a product of thought on a particular, long-passed cultural stage, when the universe was considered billions of times smaller than it actually is, when it seemed really possible for a solid celestial vault to fall to the ground, and a terrible hail of stars falling from the hooks on which they were suspended. Would it not be more accurate, therefore, to speak not of the incarnation of the Logos in the person of Jesus Christ, but of His expression in Him through the Great Monadic Birth that became the Planetary Logos of the Earth? We call Christ the Word, but the speaker does not embody, but expresses himself in the word: God does not embody Himself, but expresses Himself in Christ. It is precisely in this sense that Christ is truly the Word of God. And if so, then another obstacle to the agreement of Christianity with some other religious schools disappears.

I briefly touched on only four interreligious disagreements. Excluding one last one, which arises from controversy and perhaps insufficient clarity of formulations, insufficient crystallization of ideas, the rest are based on the mismatch of the spiritual experience of great visionaries, on the fact that when contemplating certain objects from different points of Shadanakar, under different spiritual angles, observers see the given object in different aspects. These disagreements can conditionally be called horizontal contradictions, meaning the legitimacy of both points of view and their apparent, rather than true, inconsistency.

Another example: since Christianity and Islam have existed, they have continued to struggle with what they call paganism. Over the centuries, humanity has been imbued with the idea of the irreconcilability, incompatibility of monotheism with polytheism, as a kind of axiom. Investigating why and how this happened would lead us too far astray. What is essential is on what basis do Semitic religions, asserting the existence of spiritual hierarchies and having developed doctrine on them - angelology and demonology - limit the diversity of these hierarchies to the few that were included in these medieval schemes? Is there even a shadow of consistency in their fundamental rejection of any experience of spiritual hierarchies - in their truthfulness? There are decisively no grounds for this, except, once again, references to the silence on this matter in the Gospels and the Koran. It was precisely because of the lack of grounds for a wholesale denial that in the first centuries of Christianity, the Church did not so much deny the gods of the Olympic pantheon as identify them with the demons and devils of Semitic canonized texts. At the same time, the character of these deities, as perceived by polytheistic cognition, was ignored, and lowering and discrediting features were arbitrarily attributed to them, or an overly anthropomorphic element, introduced into these concepts by the subject of cognition - polytheistic humanity - was deliberately emphasized, only remaining in their lower, folk variants by that time. As if recognition of the truth of the existence of hierarchies of nature, great elementals or spirit-tribe leaders, could shake the unity of God - the Creator and Builder of the universe, the source and mouth of the world's stream of life - more than recognition of His other beautiful children - angels and archangels, as well as those demons about whom the canonical teachings of the Bible were interpreted!

Unfortunately, this ancient misunderstanding has not yet been clarified: there is nothing left of ancient polytheism, but a fierce, narrow-minded, and wisdom-less intolerance is displayed every time Christian churches, or at least those who speak in their name, are called upon to express their opinion on the systems of Hindu, Chinese, Japanese, and Tibetan religions. The two other Semitic religions are equally intolerant. This is a typical case of horizontal differences between religions: not contradicting each other in essence, not colliding with each other in the vast spiritual cosmos, Christianity and Hinduism, Buddhism and Islam, Judaism and Shintoism speak of different spiritual realms, different segments of Shadanakara; but human limitation interprets this as contradictions and declares one doctrine true and the others false. "If God is one, then other gods are, so to speak, impostors: they are either demons or the product of human imagination." What a childish thought! The Lord God is one, but there are many gods; the spelling of this word in the Russian language with either a capital or lowercase letter clearly indicates differences in meaning in both cases. If repetition of this word in different senses scares anyone, let them replace it with some other term of polytheism, such as "great spirits" or "great hierarchies," but nothing will change from that, except that the use of the word "spirit" can lead to misunderstandings in some cases, because many of these gods are not spirits, but powerful beings possessing material embodiment, albeit in other, transphysical layers of existence.

All these misunderstandings-based disagreements between religions bring to mind a certain comparison I once encountered in religious literature, although I don't remember exactly where: as if several travelers climbed from different sides of the same mountain, saw and explored its different slopes, and upon returning, argued about who actually saw the real existing mountain and who saw figments of their own imagination. Moreover, each argued that the mountain was exactly as it appeared from their side, and the testimony of other travelers about other sides of it was false, absurd, and a trap for human souls. Thus, the first conclusion that can be drawn from the comparison of interreligious disagreements includes eliminating those that are based either simply on misunderstanding or on the mismatch of objects of religious knowledge in different realms of experience, that is, contradictions "horizontally."

But not only polytheism, but also animism and proto-animism are not exhausted by murky, accidental, subjective images that arose in the consciousness of primitive humanity: there is a trans-physical reality beyond them. Providence is Providence precisely because it never allowed peoples and races to be a playground of phantasms and illusions, without any possibility of coming into contact with a higher reality. We would have to recognize not God, but a dark, malevolent force as the true guide of humanity if we were to imagine that for tens of thousands of years, primitive humanity was denied any possibility of experiencing anything spiritual or at least immaterial, of coming into contact with anything other than the physical world and their own phantasms. "But what can the spiritual experience of a 'savage' enrich us with, we who stand on such a high stage of spiritual knowledge compared to him?" - "It is precisely what was understood then, in that environment, with that unique psyche, but was not transmitted, was lost, was not successively perceived by subsequent forms of spiritual knowledge in their treasury. A special study of magical beliefs and experience of pre-logical thinking from this point of view would help not only in the 'rehabilitation' of these ancient beliefs in their essential characteristics, but would also find a place for them in the now-forming synthetic religious worldview. It would be found, for example, that the ideas of the Australian Arunta tribe about a single life substance, constantly flowing in matter everywhere, from being to being, from object to object (and all the religion of this tribe consists essentially of such ideas), is the oldest revelation of humanity about the trans-physical cosmos: this is a living, most vivid, absolute experience of the unity of life force; the Australians called it arungviltja, developed Brahmanism calls it prana, and what the world science will call it in twenty or thirty years - we will still hear."

This disagreement - the assertion of the thesis of the Arungvilta-prana(^1) ancient beliefs and its denial by the overwhelming majority of later religious teachings - can be regarded as a stage disagreement, a disagreement "vertically," a disagreement between different levels of religious knowledge. But even here we encounter the same error, the same unjustified approach to another's experience that we encountered when discussing the question of Islam's denial of the cult of saints or the idea of the Trinity. And here, under all the arguments presented against the ancient revelation, the same naive line of thought is concealed: authoritative texts canonized for me say nothing about Arungvilta-prana; therefore, it does not exist. The line of thought is at least dangerous because in that case, one would have to deny the reality not only of Arungvilta-prana but also of radio waves, elementary particles, many chemical elements, galaxies, and even, for example, the planet Uranus, because canonical texts keep absolute silence about all of this.

____________
(^1): By the way, if the Gospel does not speak directly about Arungvilta-prana, it tells in detail about a long series of cases when Christ and later the apostles used this entity. It is entirely unclear how Christian Orthodox could explain the essence of that immaterial mechanism used by the perpetrators of miraculous healings if they deny the existence of life force spread everywhere.

Thus, it is also revealed that there is a decisive need to take into account what was not taken into account during the formation of ancient, so-called classical confessions: the experience of primitive spiritual knowledge, as well as what could not have been taken into account at that time due to the course of events: the experience of the centuries-long evolution of religions on all continents, the experience of world history, and the experience of science. The material from these series of experiences teaches us to approach all dogmas and theses dynamically, to be able to understand every thesis as a link in the chain of religious-historical development and to be able to divide it into two or even three layers. The deepest layer is the foundation of the idea, containing a relative particular truth. Another layer is the specific coloring, development, and detailing of the idea to the extent that an individual, racial, or epochal aspect justifies it, for it is only such a racial or epochal makeup of the soul that made it possible for this people to perceive this idea in the first place. The outermost, third layer is the shell, aberrations, the inevitable haze of human consciousness, through which the light of revelation penetrates. Therefore, the experience of all stages of development, including polytheistic, animistic, etc., must be freed from its outer layer, from the shell, rethought and included in the worldview of the religion as a whole. Of course, the principle of such work is only vaguely outlined here, the systems of criteria require enormous development, and in general, such a revision of the "religious heritage" is a colossal task that requires the joint efforts of many people; at present, there are not even enough personnel for it, let alone the other necessary conditions. But if this task is great, the sooner at least preparatory work is started, the better. The difficulties should not be underestimated, but there is every reason to hope that, given goodwill, energy, and initiative of the leaders, the gaps and rifts that currently divide all religions will gradually be filled, and although each of the religions will preserve its uniqueness and distinctiveness, some kind of spiritual union, some kind of unification will eventually unite all the teachings of the "right hand".

It is known that many Japanese who practice Christianity remain faithful to Shintoism at the same time. This is something that devout Catholics, Protestants, and even Orthodox Christians find bothersome, as they cannot understand how it is psychologically possible, and even feel that there is something sacrilegious about it. However, this is possible without sacrilege, and it is even natural because the experience of Christianity and the experience of Shintoism differ horizontally: they are about different things. Shintoism is a national myth. It is an aspect of the world's religious revelation addressed to the Japanese people and only to them. It is an understanding of the spiritual, or rather, transphysical reality that transcends the Japanese people and only manifests itself in their history and culture. Shintoism does not provide answers to questions of a cosmic, planetary, or universal nature: about the Creator of the world, the origin of evil and suffering, or the ways of cosmic evolution. It only speaks of Japan's meta-history, its meta-culture, of the hierarchies of its people, and of the heavenly assembly of enlightened souls who ascended to the higher worlds of Shadanakar from Japan. The syncretism of the Japanese, that is, their simultaneous confession of Shintoism and Catholicism, Shintoism and Buddhism, is not a psychological paradox, but, on the contrary, the first hint of how the experiences and truths of different religions should harmoniously complement each other.

Of course, before the union between Christianity and other religions and cults of the "right hand" becomes a reality - and this is one of the historical tasks of the Rose of the World - it is necessary to achieve the reunion of the Christian churches: the preparation for such a reunion, theological, philosophical, psychological, cultural, and organizational, will be carried out by the Rose of the World with unflagging enthusiasm. Until the reunification of Christianity takes place, until the Eighth Ecumenical Council (or several consecutive councils) considers the entire volume of the old dogmatics and introduces into it a series of theses based on the spiritual experience of the last thousand years, and until they sanction with the highest authority of reunited Christianity the theses of the teachings of the Rose of the World, until then, these theses may, of course, be confessed, affirmed, and preached, but they should not be cast into closed, completed, unconditional forms recommended for confession by all Christians.

In this reunification of Christian denominations and in the further union of all religions of Light for the common concentration of all forces on the improvement of humanity and the spiritualization of nature, the Rose of the World sees its supra-religious and interreligious nature.

The religious exclusivity of its followers is not only foreign to them, it is impossible. Wisdom teaches them to cooperate with all peoples in their highest ideals.

Therefore, the structure of the Rose of the World implies a series of concentric circles. Followers of any "right-hand" religion should not be honored by those outside the universal church. Those among them who have not yet reached the consciousness of supra-religious unity occupy the outer circles.

The middle circles include less active, less creative followers of the Rose of the World, while the inner circles include those who have placed the meaning of their existence in conscious and free god-making.

Let the Christian enter the Buddhist temple with awe and reverence: for thousands of years, the peoples of the East, separated from the centers of Christianity by deserts and mountain ranges, have learned about the truth of other parts of the upper world through the wisdom of their teachers. Through the smoke of the incense, here flicker the sculptures of high lords of other worlds and great messengers who spoke about these worlds to people. The Western man has not come into contact with these worlds, so let his mind and soul be enriched with the knowledge preserved here.

Let the Muslim enter the Hindu temple with a peaceful, pure, and strict feeling: false gods do not look upon him here, but conditional images of great spirits, whom the peoples of India understood and passionately loved, and whose testimony should be accepted by other peoples with joy and trust.

And let the orthodox Shintoist not pass by the inconspicuous synagogue with contempt and indifference: here another great people, enriching humanity with the deepest values, safeguards its experience of such truths with which the spiritual world was opened to it - and to no one else.

Their truths, by which the spiritual world was revealed to them - and to no one else.

The Rose of the World can be compared to an inverted flower, whose roots are in the sky, and whose petal cup is here, among humanity, on earth. Its stem is a revelation, through which spiritual juices flow, nourishing and strengthening its petals - a fragrant choir of religions. But besides its petals, it has a core: this is its own teaching. This teaching is not a mechanical combination of the highest theses of various theosophemes of the past. In addition to a new attitude toward religious heritage, the Rose of the World implements a new attitude toward nature, history, human cultural destinies, their tasks, creativity, love, paths of cosmic ascent, and the consistent enlightenment of Shadanakar. In some cases, this attitude is new because although individual figures of the past spoke about it, it is only now being accepted and confessed by religion and the church. In other cases, the attitude of the Rose of the World is new in an absolute sense because it has never been expressed by anyone before. This new attitude arises from a new spiritual experience, without which instead of the Rose of the World, only rational and fruitless religious eclecticism would be possible.

But before we delve into the contents of this spiritual experience and the foundations of this teaching, we must first understand the paths by which souls acquire this experience and the methods by which we can facilitate or accelerate its acquisition for ourselves.
